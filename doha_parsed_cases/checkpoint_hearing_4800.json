He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in \nconnection with his employment. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \nThe SOR identified four allegations consisting of delinquent Federal back taxes \nowed for tax years 2010, 2011, 2017, and 2021, totaling approximately $19,000. \nApplicant admits each of the allegations with explanations. Applicant began working for \nhis current employer in 2021.  He is applying for a security clearance for the first time. \nApplicant explained that he has had tax problems since 2008. At that time, he \ntook about $65,000 out of his 401(k) to put down on the purchase of a house. The \nescrow closing took eight months, and so he was hit with a 30 percent tax penalty for \nearly withdrawal. This cost him additional taxes and penalties of about $20,000. (Tr. p. \n27.) He did not file his 2008 income taxes on time but filed them the following year. (Tr. \n26.) He started making payments towards resolving the taxes and then lost his job, and \nhad to stop making payments. When he started working again, payments were either \ngarnished from his account, or he made payments to resolve the debt. He stated that \nhe has paid off his 2008 income taxes, and that since 2012, he has filed his income tax \nreturns on time. (Tr. 38.) \nIn regard to the back taxes owed that are listed in the SOR, he stated that for the \npast two years he has been trying to set up a payment plan with the Internal Revenue \nService (IRS) but has not been successful. (Tr. pp. 31-35.) He has not made any \npayments toward resolving any of the back taxes listed in the SOR, and they remain \nowing. (Tr. p. 31.) \nApplicant believes he incurred delinquent tax debt for tax years 2010 and 2011, \nbecause he sold a number of stock options, considered income, that he used to pay for \na sewage backup problem he had to fix in his house. (Tr. p. 29.) In 2017, he was laid \noff from his job, and he did not have stable employment until 2020.

He was hit with additional tax liability. In 2020, he refinanced his \nhouse to lower the payment so he could afford to keep it. He also exhausted his \noriginal 401(k) to keep the house. He currently owes about $410,000, on his house.  He \nbelieves that the house is now worth about $600,000, so there is equity there. In 2021, \nApplicant began working for his current employer, and did not pay enough in Federal \ntaxes. (Tr. p. 37.) \nFor the past thirteen years, Applicant has been struggling with his back tax \nliability and he continues to remain indebted. Applicant currently earns about $159,000 \nannually. His wife is also employed and earns about $16.00 an hour. He currently has \nabout $50,000 in his new 401(k). His mortgage payment is $3,100 monthly. He has no \nother savings yet. (Tr. pp. 22-23.) \nApplicant stated that he plans to pay his back taxes as soon as he can. He may \nrefinance his house to obtain the money to pay his back taxes. Applicant stated that he \nhas been working on getting other things taken care of and he has not put the effort into \ngetting his back taxes paid. \nThe following delinquent debts are of security concern: \n1.a. Applicant is indebted to the Federal Government for delinquent back taxes \nin the amount of $2,516.94 for tax year 2010.  The debt remains owing.  (Tr. p. 31, and \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit D.)    \n1.b. Applicant is indebted to the Federal Government for delinquent back taxes \nin the amount of $8,141.56 for tax year 2011.  The debt remains owing.  (Tr. p. 31, and \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit D.)     \n1.c. Applicant is indebted to the Federal Government for delinquent back taxes in \nthe amount of $4,708 for tax year 2017. The debt remains owing. (Tr. p. 31, and \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit D.) \n1.d. Applicant is indebted to the Federal Government for delinquent back taxes in \nthe amount of $3,000 for tax year 2021. The debt remains owing. (Tr. p. 31, and \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit E.) \nApplicant\u2019s performance appraisals from October 1, 2020, through September \n30, 2021; October 1, 2021, through September 30, 2022; reflect that he \u201csuccessfully \nmet expectations.\u201d (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A and B.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG).

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;   \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has a history of financial hardship and as a result, has fallen behind on \npaying his Federal income taxes. For the past thirteen years, he has had delinquent \nFederal back taxes owed for tax years 2010, 2011, 2017, and 2021. He has not made \nany payments towards resolving these debts. \nHis actions or inactions both \ndemonstrated a history of not addressing his debt and an inability to do so. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant has delinquent Federal back taxes that he has not been able to afford \nto pay. He stated that he has tried numerous times over the past two years to get the \nIRS to accept his payment or to set up a payment plan with him, but he has been \nunsuccessful. Applicant also admitted that he did not realize the seriousness of these \nback taxes and how important it is to the Defense Department to get them resolved. \nThus, he remains delinquently indebted to each of the debts listed in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s financial irresponsibility and inaction for so long casts doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Applicant needs more time to show the \nGovernment that he will work to resolve his back taxes with regular systematic \npayments and consistency. None of the mitigating conditions are applicable. \nThere is insufficient evidence in the record to show that Applicant has shown \ngood judgment or that he has made a good faith effort to resolve his delinquent back \ntaxes. Applicant still owes a significant amount of money to the Federal Government \nthat he obviously cannot afford to pay or has simply ignored. There is insufficient \nevidence in the record to show that the Applicant has carried his burden of proof to \nestablish mitigation of the government security concerns under Guideline F. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nIn the event that \nApplicant follows through with a commitment to show financial responsibility, sometime \nin the future he may be found to be sufficiently reliable to properly protect and access \nclassified information. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.  through 1.d.   \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are incorporated and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow.

The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (Exec.

The hearing was convened as \nrescheduled. At hearing, the Government's case consisted of two exhibits (GEs 1-2). \nApplicant relied on one witness (himself) and 11 exhibits (AEs A-L). \nAll but AE L of Applicant\u2019s proffered exhibits were admitted without objection. The \nGovernment\u2019s objection to the admission of AE L on grounds of relevance and the absence \nof official endorsement of the article by the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) was sustained \nwithout prejudice to Applicant\u2019s resubmission of a revised version of the article in a post-\nhearing submission. The transcript (Tr.) was received on May 13, 2024. \nBesides its two exhibits, the Government requested administrative notice of facts \ncontained in 12 attachments related to the country of India. Administrative or official notice \nis the appropriate type of notice used for administrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. \n16-02522 at 2-3 (App. Bd. July 12, 2017); ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n. 1 (App. Bd. Apr. \n12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004). Administrative notice is appropriate for noticing \nfacts or government reports that are well known. See Stein, Administrative Law, Sec. 25.01 \n(Bender & Co. 2006). For good cause shown, administrative notice was granted with \nrespect to the above-named background reports addressing the geopolitical situation in \nIndia. \nAdministrative notice was extended, without objection, to the documents themselves, \nconsistent with the provisions of Rule 201 of Fed. R. Evid. This notice did not foreclose \nApplicant from challenging the accuracy and reliability of the information contained in the \nreports addressing the current status of India. Additional administrative notice was taken \n(without objections) of U.S.-India Relations, U.S. Dept. of State (Nov. 9, 2023); U.S. \nRelations with India, U.S. Dept. of State (July 2022); and U.S. Security Cooperation with \nIndia, Fact Sheet, U.S. Dept. of State (Jan. 2021). \nProcedural Issues \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to supplement the record \nwith a revised version of its AE L hearing exhibit. For good cause shown, Applicant was \ngranted 12 days to supplement the record with a revised version of AE L. Department \nCounsel was afforded two days to respond. Within the time permitted, Applicant submitted \na revised version of AE L (a reproduced article in a USIP website that was initially offered \nfor administrative notice purposes and rejected). The Government, in turn, reasserted its \nobjection to the admission of the revised AE L, citing lack of relevance, the USIP\u2019s \ndisclaimer of any endorsement of the article (entitled \u201cA Big Step Forward in U.S.-India \nDefense), and the absence of any cited U.S. official source within the article.

However, the authors\u2019 reported opinions in the USIP \nare reconcilable with the data compiled in U.S. Security Cooperation with India, supra, and \nthe article is admitted for limited weight purposes only. Applicant\u2019s post-hearing \nsubmissions of AEs M-Q are admitted. Post-hearing, Applicant also submitted a document \nentitled U.S. Security Cooperation with India, Fact Sheet, U.S. Dept. of State (Jan. 2021), \nand requested administrative notice be taken of the document. Applicant\u2019s submission was \nreceived without objection and assigned administrative notice status. (XVI) \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline B, Applicant allegedly (a) has a spouse and two children who are \ncitizens of India; (b) has parents and a brother who are citizens and residents of India; (c) \nhas a mother-in-law and father-in-law who are citizens and residents of India; (d) has a \nbrother-in-law who is a citizen and resident of India, and who formerly served as an \ninspector of goods and services for the Indian government; (e) owns several properties in \nIndia with an approximate value o $124,000 USD; (f) has a spouse who owns several \nproperties in India as a result of his purchasing them in 2013 or 2014 for approximately \n$125,000 USD, and gifting them to his spouse in 2018 or 2019; and (g) maintains four bank \naccounts in India, with approximate values of $50,000, $2,000, $3,000, and $3,000 USD, \nrespectively.

He further claimed that \nhis brother-in-law in India resigned from his position with the Indian government, \ntransitioned into academia, and no longer has any affiliations with Indian government \nagencies. Applicant also claimed a long-term commitment to residing in the United States \nwith the explicit intent of establishing a lasting home in this country. He claimed that he \nfinancial investments in India are guided by a broader perspective of global diversification. \nAnd, he claimed that his own construction project underway in India is fully funded, nearing \ncompletion, and intended for sale. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance.

(Tr. 136-137) \nApplicant\u2019s financial interests in India \nApplicant owns seven properties in India (four of which are mortgage-free) that he \nvalues together at $1,124,000 USD. (GE 2; 70-7, 90) Three of the seven properties he \npurchased in 2013 and 2014 are titled in his name. (Tr. 90, 94-95, 102-10, 114) Of these \nthree properties, only two of them have mortgages. Income from these properties amounts \nto more than 10 per cent of his overall income, and he is not dependent on the legal or \nequitable income derived from them. (Tr. 116-117) Sources of income used to purchase \nthese properties and fund the mortgages consists of Applicant\u2019s earned U.S. income and \npotentially the earned income of his wife. (Tr. 72-73, 109, 116-120) \nShould anything happen to any of these Indian properties, Applicant is assuredly \ncapable of \u201cliving without any of those.\u201d (Tr. 140) For these three Indian properties that he \nowns and controls, it is his intention to dispose of them when market conditions become \nfavorable. (Tr. 114) \nBesides the three Indian properties he purchased and retains, Applicant purchased \nfour additional properties in 2013 or 2014 for approximately $125,000 USD with the \nintention of gifting them to his first wife. (Tr. 85, 91-92, 112) He later gifted them to his \ncurrent wife (free and clear of any mortgages) as a hedge against her being denied \npermanent U.S. residence status. (GE 2; Tr. 70-71 Applicant has no control over the \ndisposition of any of these gifted Indian properties. (Tr. 111-114) \nApplicant has four bank accounts of his own in India with four different Indian banks \n(banks A-D, respectively). (GE 2; Tr. 73-74) His respective bank balances with these banks \nare as follows: $50,000 USD with Bank A; $2,000 USD with Bank B; $3,000 USD with Bank \nC; and $3,000 USD with Bank D. (GE 2; Tr. 106) Applicant created these bank accounts in \n2020 and uses them (between $50,000 and $60,000 USD) to pay the annual mortgages \ndue on his Indian properties. (GE 2; Tr. 106-107) Two of these four accounts were jointly \noriginated with his wife. Applicant originated the remaining two individually. (Tr. 107) \nApplicant\u2019s U.S. financial interests \nBetween December 2020 and April 2024, Applicant purchased numerous U.S. \nproperties. (AE J) He reported 13 properties purchased with a combined cost of $3,591,000 \nUSD during this time frame. (AE J; Tr. 143) He has retained these properties, which he \nbelieves have not enjoyed any appreciation to date. (Tr. 144) Applicant currently earns \napproximately $175,000 a year USD from his current employment and earns an additional \n$120,000 a year from secondary consulting jobs.

(GE 2; \nTr. 85) His trips generally ranged in time between 21 and 30 days. (GE 2) In none of his \ntrips to India was he ever stopped, questioned, searched, or otherwise detained by local \nIndian .custom officials. (GE 2) \nApplicant assured that he was never contacted by anyone associated with foreign \nintelligence, terrorist security, counterintelligence, or military operations. (GE 2) Nor was he \never threatened, coerced, or pressured in any way to cooperate with a foreign government, \nforeign intelligence, or security service. (GE 2) \nConsistently, Applicant has informed his security department of his travels and any \nforeign contacts he encountered. (AEs B and D) Both Applicant and his program manager \nexpressed assurances of Applicant\u2019s commitments to keep his security department alerted \nto any foreign travels, contacts, and money transfers in the future. (AE 1; Tr. 81-82) \nApplicant\u2019s assurances are credible and are accepted. \nCountry information on India \nConsidered the world\u2019s largest democratic republic, India is also a very diverse \ncountry, in population, geography, and climate. It is the world\u2019s second most populous \ncountry and the world\u2019s seventh largest country in area. See Request for Administrative \nNotice, Republic of India, at 2. \nIndia is a constitutional democracy, whose Constitution defines it as a sovereign, \nsocialist, secular democratic republic. It is a multiparty, federal, parliamentary democracy \nwith a bicameral parliament and it has an historical reputation for respecting the rights of its \ncitizens. See Country Reports on Human Rights: India, U.S. Dept. of State (March 2023) \nHowever, there have been reports of extrajudicial killings of persons in custody, \ndisappearances, torture and rape by police and security forces, who generally enjoy de \nfacto impunity.

The guidelines do not \nrequire administrative judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is \nto be evaluated in the context of the whole person in accordance with AG \u00b6 2\u00a9  \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the \npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a) . \nAG \u00b6 2(a) is intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial commonsense \ndecision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context of \nthe whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period of an \napplicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the applicant is an \nacceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following AG \u00b6 2(a) factors:  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy \nfactors are pertinent herein: \nForeign Influence \nThe Concern: Foreign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result in divided \nallegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they create circumstances in \nwhich the individual may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.

See AG \u00b6 6. \n  Burden of Proof  \nUnder the AGs, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may \nbe made only upon a threshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest. Because the Directive requires administrative judges to make a commonsense \nappraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an \napplicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and \nmateriality of that evidence. See United States, v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509-511 (1995). \nAs with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences which \nhave a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the judge \ncannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture. \nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial evidence \nany controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven \nhave a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security \nclearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not require the Government to \naffirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified \ninformation before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather, the judge must \nconsider and weigh the cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently \nfail to safeguard classified information. \nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or \ncontroverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of \nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation. Based on the requirement of Exec. Or. 10865 that all security clearances be \nclearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, \n531 (1988). And because all security clearances must be clearly consistent with the national \ninterest, the burden of persuasion must remain with the Applicant. \nAnalysis  \nApplicant is an engineer of a U.S.-based defense contractor. He is a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen and is married to a woman of Indian descent who immigrated to the United States in \n2021 with his children, all of whom have permanent U.S. residence status. Trust concerns \nrelate to (a) Applicant\u2019s having both immediate and extended family members who are \ncitizens and residents of India and (b) his ownership and control of property and bank \naccounts in India. \nForeign Influence \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife and family have deep roots in India, a country rich in history and \nsocio/political traditions, constitutional government and institutional respect for human rights, \nintermixed with periodic reports of abuses by police and government authorities. Despite \nencouraging efforts in the development of strategic partnerships between India and the U.S. \nin recent years, there have been cited instances of illegal and damaging export practices by \nIndian firms associated with the Indian government to create dual use diversion risks. \nThe Government urges security concerns over risks that Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s parents \nand family members residing in India, might be subject to undue foreign influence by Indian \ngovernment authorities to access classified information in Applicant\u2019s possession or control. \nBecause Applicant\u2019s wife has family members who have Indian citizenship by birth and \nreside currently in India, they present potential heightened security risks covered by \ndisqualifying conditions (DC) \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact, regardless of method, with a foreign family \nmember, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d; and 7(f), \u201csubstantial business, financial, \nor property interests in a foreign country, or in any foreign owned or foreign-operated \nbusiness that could subject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest.\u201d The citizenship/residence status of these family members in \nIndia pose some potential concerns for Applicant because of the risks of undue foreign \ninfluence that could potentially impact the property and financial interests in India subject to \nhis control. \nFor Applicant, his contacts (frequent with his immediate family members in India and \nless frequent with his extended Indian family members) reflect close familial ties and \naffections of longstanding duration. And, there is a rebuttable presumption that a person \nwith immediate family members in a foreign country has ties of affection for, or obligation to, \nhis or her immediate and extended family members.

Feb. 20, 2002) \nTrue, none of Applicant\u2019s family members in India (both immediate and extended) \ncome with any history of being subjected to any coercion or pressure. These historical \nantecedents limit the risk of any potential conflict situation. And, while the absence of any \npast coercive measures taken by Indian authorities does not completely absolve Applicant \nfrom any coercive risks in the future given India\u2019s checkered history of intelligence collection, \nterrorism, crime, and human rights abuse, the practical risks of any coercive measures being \ntaken against his family members (all of whom reside in safe regions of India) should be \nconsidered minimal. \nIndia to its credit has maintained good bilateral economic and strategic defense \nrelations with the United State.

What is considered to be an acceptable risk in one foreign country \nmay not be in another. The AGs take into account the country\u2019s demonstrated relations with \nthe United States as an important consideration in gauging whether the particular relatives \nwith citizenship and residency elsewhere create a heightened security risk. \nBased on his case-specific circumstances, MC \u00b6 8(a), \u201cthe nature of the relationships \nwith foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the persons or \nactivities of these persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, \norganization, or government and the interests of the United States,\u201d is available to Applicant. \nNeither Applicant\u2019s parents, brother, nor extended family members residing in India pose \nheightened security risks that could subject them to potential pressures and influence from \nIndian government and military officials. \nAnother mitigating condition is available to Applicant is MC \u00b6 8(b): \u201cthere is no conflict \nof interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign \nperson, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the individual can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d Applicant\u2019s \ndemonstrated loyalty and professional commitments to the United States are well \ndemonstrated and sufficient under these circumstances to neutralize any potential conflicts \nthat are related to his relationships with his immediate and extended family members. \nOther mitigating conditions are available to Applicant. as well have mixed application \nto Applicant\u2019s situation.

Overall, potential security concerns over Applicant's having family members \nand substantial financial interests in India are sufficiently mitigated to permit safe predictive \njudgments about Applicant's ability to withstand risks of undue influence attributable to his \nfamilial relationships and financial interests in India. Favorable conclusions warrant with \nrespect to the allegations covered by Guideline B. \nFormal Findings \nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the \ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I make \nthe following formal findings: \nGUIDELINE B (FOREIGN INFLUENCE): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.   \nClearance is granted. \n \nRoger Wesley \nAdministrative Judge \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                   \n \n \n14 \n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on \nJune 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 25, 2023, and she elected to have her \ncase be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. The Government\u2019s written \ncase was submitted on November 9, 2023.

Department Counsel requested that I take administrative \nnotice of certain facts about Iraq (Item 5). I marked this request as Hearing Exhibit (HE) \nI. It is not admitted in evidence, but I have taken administrative notice of the facts \ncontained therein, as summarized in the Findings of Fact, below.   \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations. She is 59 years old, widowed, and \ndoes not have any children. She married her spouse, a native-born U.S. citizen and \nformer U.S. military servicemember, in Turkey in 2010, and he passed away in \nSeptember 2014. She has owned her home in the United States since October 2018. \n(Items 3-4) \nApplicant was born in Iraq. She graduated from high school in 1984, received \ndiplomas in 1994 and 1998, and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2002. From 2010 to \n2011, she worked for her spouse\u2019s company in Iraq but left to care for her ill mother, \nwho passed away in April 2014. During this time, she was supported by her spouse until \nhis death, and then she was supported by her family. (Items 3-4) \nIn 2015, at age 49, Applicant immigrated to the United States on a special \nimmigration visa (SIV). She was supported by her sister-in-law and brother-in-law until \nshe obtained part-time employment in 2015. She worked part time for a humanitarian \naid organization, a state university, and a community college from 2015 to 2019. She \nthen worked full time for a social services organization from 2019 to 2022 and then \nbriefly for a mental health services company in 2022. Since her June 2022 background \ninterview, she has worked as a part-time tutor at a state university. She has never held \na security clearance. (Items 3-4) \nApplicant is a dual citizen of Iraq and the United States. She became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen in October 2020. She was issued a U.S. passport in December \n2020, and it is not scheduled to expire until December 2030. She was also issued an \nIraqi passport in 2021, and it is not scheduled to expire until 2029. She used her Iraqi \npassport to travel to Iraq to visit her family, as further discussed below. (Items 3-4) \nApplicant\u2019s mother, father, one brother, and one brother-in-law are deceased. \nHer other two brothers and her two sisters are citizens and residents of Iraq. (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a) Her brothers are retired, one sister is unemployed, and the other sister is a \ncounselor. She maintains weekly telephonic contact with the younger of her two sisters \nand monthly telephonic contact with her other siblings in Iraq. (Items 1-4) \nApplicant also has two brothers-in-law and two sisters-in-law who are citizens \nand residents of Iraq. Her brothers-in-law work as a factory worker and an officer, \nrespectively, one sister-in-law is retired, and her other sister-in-law is unemployed.

(Items 1-4) \nApplicant saw her family in Iraq when she traveled there in 2016, 2021, and \n2022. On occasion, she sends her family in Iraq $100 or $200 when they need it. \nApplicant complied with reporting requirements, to include reporting her family in Iraq in \nher SCA, during her background interview, and in her Answer. Appellant\u2019s siblings-in-\nlaw are not alleged in the SOR. Thus, they may not be an independent basis for \ndenying Applicant\u2019s clearance. However, they may be considered to evaluate \nApplicant\u2019s credibility; to evaluate her evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed \ncircumstances; to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or to provide evidence for the whole-person analysis. I have considered \nthese unalleged family members for these limited purposes. (Items 1-4) \nApplicant owns a home in Iraq with an approximate value of $400,000 USD. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b) She previously co-owned this home with her mother until her mother\u2019s \npassing in 2014, when she became the sole owner. She also owns an apartment in \nIraq, which she purchased in 2014 for $20,000 USD. During her June 2022 background \ninterview, she estimated its value as $160,000 USD. (SOR \u00b6 1.c) After her father died in \n2002, she has received a retirement benefit of $150 monthly from the Iraqi government. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d) She indicated during her background interview that her brother holds this \nmoney for her and then sends it to her in the United States. She will continue to receive \nthis benefit until her death. (Items 1-4) \nIraq \nIraq is a constitutional parliamentary republic. The October 2021 parliamentary \nelections were generally considered technically sound and credible. The elections \nwere observed by the European Union and domestic civil society organizations and \nmonitored by the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq. Domestic and \ninternational elections observers cited procedural and transparency improvements to \nthe 2018 electoral process. They noted, however, that violence and intimidation by \nparamilitary militia groups in the months ahead of the elections likely affected voters\u2019 \nchoices and voter turnout. The elections came because of widespread protests that \nbegan in October 2019 and led to the resignation of former Prime Minister Adil Abd al-\nMahdi in December 2019. On October 13, 2022, Iraqi Council of Representatives \nmembers elected Abdulatif Jamal Rashid as the president of Iraq. On October 27, \n2022, the Council of Representatives confirmed Mohammed Shiaa al-Sudani as prime \nminister along with 21 of 23 of his cabinet ministers. On December 3, 2022, the \nCouncil of Representatives confirmed Sudani\u2019s two remaining cabinet ministers. \nThe U.S. Department of State travel advisory for Iraq is Level 4: Do not travel \ndue to terrorism, kidnapping, armed conflict, civil unrest, and Mission Iraq\u2019s limited \ncapacity to provide support to U.S. citizens. U.S. citizens in Iraq face high risks to their \nsafety and security, including the potential for violence and kidnapping.

ISIS \nand its associated terrorist groups indiscriminately commit attacks and violent atrocities \nin Iraq despite improved Iraqi government control. ISIS, militia groups, and criminal \ngangs target U.S. citizens for attacks and hostage-taking. \nIraq is among those countries effected by the Visa Waiver Program \nImprovement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015. Under this Act, no foreign \nnational may enter the United States without a visa if they have \u201cbeen present, at any \ntime on or after March 1, 2011,\u201d in Iraq, Syria, or any country designated by the U.S. \nGovernment as either a state sponsor of terrorism or as a \u201ccountry of concern.\u201d As \ndefined in the Act, countries of concern include those which have \u201ca significant [foreign \nterrorist organization] presence,\u201d provide \u201ca safe haven for terrorists,\u201d and/or present \nother conditions such that an individual\u2019s \u201cpresence . . . increases the likelihood that \n[they are] a credible threat to the national security of the United States.\u201d \nSignificant human rights issues included credible reports of: unlawful or arbitrary \nkillings, including extrajudicial killings by the government; forced disappearances by \nthe government; torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment \nby the government; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary arrest and \ndetention; arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy; punishment of family \nmembers for offenses allegedly committed by an individual; serious abuses in a \nconflict, including attacks resulting in civilian deaths and harm; serious restrictions on \nfree expression and media, including violence or threats of violence against journalists, \nunjustified arrests and prosecutions against journalists, censorship, and existence of \ncriminal libel laws; serious restrictions on internet freedom; substantial interference \nwith the freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of association; restrictions on \nfreedom of movement of women; forced returns of internally displaced persons to \nlocations where they faced threats to their lives and freedom; threats of violence \nagainst internally displaced persons and returnee populations perceived to have been \naffiliated with ISIS; serious government corruption; lack of investigation and \naccountability for gender-based violence; crimes involving violence targeting members \nof ethnic minority groups; crimes involving violence or threats of violence targeting \nlesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex persons; significant \nrestrictions on worker freedom of association; and the existence of the worst forms of \nchild labor. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.

The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance.

The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, \nand its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s \nfamily members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States. In considering the nature of the government, an administrative judge \nmust also consider any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR \nCase No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) (reversing decision to grant \nclearance where administrative judge did not consider terrorist activity in area where \nfamily members resided). \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened \nrisk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low standard. \n\u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \nmember living under a foreign government. Applicant\u2019s two brothers and two sisters are \nIraqi citizens residing in Iraq. Applicant maintains contact with her family in Iraq, and she \nrecently traveled there to visit them in 2022. Although she owns her home in the United \nStates, she also owns two properties in Iraq and receives a monthly benefit from the Iraqi \ngovernment. ISIS, ISIL, or Da\u2019esh, is a designated terrorist organization that is active \nnear the Iraq border.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(f) have been raised by the evidence. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which  \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation;  \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nAG \u00b6 8(a) is not established for the reasons set out in the above discussion of \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b). Applicant maintains contact with her family in Iraq and she traveled \nthere as recently as 2022 to visit them. AG \u00b6 8(c) is not established. Although she owns \nher home in the United States, she also owns two properties in Iraq and receives a \nmonthly benefit from the Iraqi government. AG \u00b6 8(f) is not established. Applicant \ncomplied with reporting requirements, to include reporting her family in Iraq in her SCA, \nduring her background interview, and in her Answer. AG \u00b6 8(e) applies. \nApplicant has lived in the United States since 2015, when she immigrated here on \nan SIV. However, the grant of an SIV does not, de-facto, equate to eligibility for access \nto classified information. See ISCR Case No. 23-01225 (App. Bd. July 11, 2024), citing \nISCR Case No. 16-02061 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 19, 2018); ISCR Case No. 16-01900 at 2 \n(App. Bd. 4 Apr. 19, 2018); ISCR Case No. 16-00024 at 2 (App. Bd.

See e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-01900 at 2, 3. Applicant is a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen with a U.S. passport, and she also owns property in the United States. These are \nfactors that weigh in Applicant\u2019s favor. However, Applicant\u2019s ties to her family and \nproperty in Iraq are as strong. Applicant failed to meet her burden to demonstrate that \nshe would resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. AG \u00b6 8(b) is not \nestablished. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline B and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant did not mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised by her foreign connections. Accordingly, I conclude she has \nnot carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, Applicant mitigated \ndrug involvement and substance misuse concerns.

Applicant relied on three witnesses (including \nhimself) and one exhibit (AE A). The transcript (Tr.) was received on August 23, 2024. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline H, Applicant allegedly used marijuana and other federally \ncontrolled drugs with varying frequency between 2012 and December 2022. Allegedly, \nhe (a) used marijuana with varying frequency from Summer 2014 through November \n2022; (b) used cocaine with varying frequency from April 2018 through Summer 2020; \n(c) used LSD with varying frequency from Spring 2019 through Spring 2020; (d) used \nhallucinogenic mushrooms with varying frequency from Summer 2021 through October \n2022; (e) misused prescription medication Adderall with varying frequency from Winter \n2017 through Spring 2022; and (f) stated his intention to use marijuana in the future on \nhis electronic questionnaires for electronic processing (e-QIP) he competed in February \n2023. \nIn his responses to the SOR and amended SOR, Applicant admitted the \nallegations covered by Guideline H with explanations. He claimed he used the cited \nLSD only three to four times and the cited hallucinogenic mushrooms only three to four \ntimes with low dosage. He further claimed he would only resume his marijuana use in \nthe future after he retires from his career. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 25-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance.

(GE 2; Tr. 35) \nIn college, Applicant also used cocaine with varying frequency. (GE 2; Tr. 23-24) \nMore specifically, between Spring 2018 and Summer 2020, he used cocaine on several \noccasions with friends who supplied the drug. (GE 2; Tr. 23-24) He credited his cocaine \nuse with enhancing his energy. (GE 2) Other illegal drugs used by Applicant in college \nwere LSD (three to four times between 2019 and 2020), hallucinogenic mushrooms \n(four times in low dosages between Summer 2021 and October 2022), and prescription \nmedications (Adderall) with varying frequency between Winter 2017 and Spring 2022. \nApplicant obtained his Adderall from his brother while attending college. (GEs 1\u00ad\n2; Tr. 25-32) Use of the drug improved his ability to focus on his studies. At all times, he \nwas aware that the drugs and non-prescribed prescription he used were illegal under \nboth federal and state law.

(GEs 1-2; Tr. 35-36) Throughout the investigative \nprocess, Applicant has been completely honest and upfront about his past use of illegal \ndrugs. His assurances of sustained abstinence from illegal drug use since December \n2022, his expressed intentions to avoid illegal drugs in the future and disassociate from \nold friends who used drugs are sincere and credible, and accepted. \nEndorsements and performance evaluations \nApplicant\u2019s parents who testified on his behalf extolled his growth and maturity \nand commitments to avoid illegal drugs in the future. His parents expressed full \nconfidence in his ability to avoid all illegal and non-prescribed drugs in the future. (Tr. \n56) They credited him with being reliable, trustworthy, hardworking, and steadfast in his \npersonal and professional pursuits. (Tr. 48-56) They believe he learned valuable \nlessons about the risks and dangers to using illegal drugs and will not return to the \ncollege lifestyle he left behind.

These guidelines are not inflexible \nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These AG guidelines take into account factors that \ncould create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified and privacy information. \nThe AG guidelines include conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of the conditions that could \nmitigate public trust concerns, if any. These guidelines must be considered before \ndeciding whether or not eligibility to hold a public trust position should be granted, \ncontinued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive \nreliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in \narriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \nDrug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nThe Concern: The illegal use of controlled substances, to include \nthe misuse of prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that\ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner\ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because  such behavior\nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises\nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules, and regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled\nsubstance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802.

All of the drugs that \nApplicant either used or misused in the case of prescription drugs (like Adderall) are \nfederally controlled under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 801-971 (1970) \nand preempt any conflicting state laws. \nAcknowledging his awareness of the illegality of the drugs he was using, he \ncommitted to abstaining from all illegal drug use and association with those who use \nillegal drugs. His commitments are found to be sincere, credible, and worthy of \nacceptance. \nJurisdictional issues \nHolding a public trust position involves the exercise of important fiducial \nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor in \nprotecting and guarding personally identifiable information (PII). DoD Manual 5200.02, \nwhich incorporated and canceled DoD Regulation 5200.2-R, covers both critical-\nsensitive and non-critical sensitive security positions for civilian personnel. See 5200.02, \n\u00b6 4.1a(3)(c)    \nDefinitions for critical-sensitive and non-critical sensitive positions provided in \n5200.02, \u00b6 4.1a(3)(c) contain descriptions similar to those used to define ADP I and II \npositions under DoD Regulation 5200.2-R. (32 C.F.R. \u00a7 154.13 and Part 154, App. J) \nADP positions are broken down as follows in C.F.R. \u00a7 154.13 and Part 154, App. J): \nADP I (critical-sensitive positions covering the direction, design, and planning of \ncomputer systems) and ADP II (non-critical-sensitive positions covering the design, \noperation, and maintenance of computer systems). Considered together, the ADP I and \nII positions covered in DoD Regulation 5200.2-R refine and explain the same critical-\nsensitive positions covered in DoD Manual 5200.02, \u00b6 4.1a(3)(c) and are reconcilable \nas included positions in 5200.02. \nSo, while ADP trustworthiness positions are not expressly identified in DoD \nManual 5200.02, they are implicitly covered as non-critical sensitive positions that \nrequire \u201caccess to automated systems that contain active duty, guard, or personally \nidentifiable information or information pertaining to Service members that is otherwise \nprotected from disclosure by DoD 5400.11-R .  .  .\u201d  DoD 5200.02, \u00b6 4.1a(3)(c)   See \nDoD Directive 5220.6, \u00b6\u00b6 D5(d) and D8.

DC \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \u201dany \nsubstance misuse\u201d and 25(c), \u201cillegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \nIllegal drugs or drug paraphernalia,\u201d apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nTo his credit, Applicant abandoned all use and involvement with federally \ncontrolled drugs and non-prescribed prescription drugs. His commitments to avoid any \nuse of illegal and non-prescribed drugs are credible and convincing. While the Appeal \nBoard has not provided any bright lines for the sustaining of abstinence of illegal and \nnon-prescribed drugs, it has consistently stressed the importance of vigilance and \ncaution when assessing recurrence risks for dangerous drugs like cocaine, LSD, and \nhallucinogenic mushrooms. \nIn Applicant\u2019s case, consideration of his abstinence commitments and all of the \nsurrounding circumstances are enough to facilitate safe predictions that any risks of \nrecurrent use of illegal drugs in the future are minimal. So, based on Applicant\u2019s \nfurnished abstinence timeline of his past use of illegal and non-prescribed prescription \ndrugs, he may rely fully on the mitigation benefits of MC \u00b6 26(a), \u201cthe behavior \nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that \nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d \nWhole-person assessment \nFrom \na \nwhole-person \nperspective, \nApplicant \nhas established \nenough \nindependent probative evidence of his ability to avert the use of illegal and non-\nprescribed prescription drugs in the foreseeable future. Considering the record as a \nwhole, and granting due weight to Applicant\u2019s positive commitments to abstinence and \nhis defense contributions, there is sufficient probative evidence of sustainable mitigation \nin the record to make safe, predictable judgments about his ability to avoid illegal and \nnon-prescribed prescription drugs in the foreseeable future. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude drug involvement and \nsubstance abuse public trust concerns are mitigated.

On June 5, 2024, Department Counsel \namended SOR \u00b6 1.f by alleging additional years (2016, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021) that \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file his state income tax returns (Hearing Exhibit (HE) III). \nApplicant failed to respond to the amendment before his hearing, but he admitted to the \namended language at his hearing. \nThe case was assigned to me on May 2, 2024. The Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on May 28, 2024, and the hearing was \nconvened as scheduled on July 16, 2024, using the video capabilities of the Microsoft \nTeams platform. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 9, which were \nadmitted into evidence without objection. The Government\u2019s exhibit list and discovery \nletter were marked as HE I and II. The Government also presented a demonstrative \nexhibit, which was marked as HE IV. \nApplicant testified but did not offer any exhibits at his hearing. The record was \nkept open until August 16 2024, to allow him to submit additional evidence. He \nsubmitted AE A-D, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on July 24, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations with explanations. After a review of \nthe pleadings and evidence, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 63-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began working \nfor his current employer in September 2018. He is a computer-based trainer. He retired \nfrom the U.S. Army in 2018, after serving 32 years in the Army National Guard, the \nArmy Reserve, and on active duty. He deployed to Iraq in 2010. He retired as a \nlieutenant colonel with an honorable discharge. He receives disability income from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA). His holds a master\u2019s degree. He is married (since \n1981) and has two adult sons. He also had a person who lived with his family that he \nconsidered \u201clike a son\u201d (JH), but who was not legally adopted. (Tr. at 6, 29-30, 37, 44-\n45, 47-48; GE 1) \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant filed a Chapter 7, bankruptcy in about 1986 that \nresulted in a discharge of his debts in 1987. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) It also alleged that Applicant \nfiled a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in about 1998 that resulted in a resolution of his debts in \n2001. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \nThe SOR further alleged that Applicant owed delinquent federal income taxes in \nthe approximate amount of $10,385 for tax years 2015, 2016, and 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); \nthat he owed delinquent state income taxes in the approximate amount of $5,650 for tax \nyears 2015 and 2019-2021 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); that he failed to timely file his 2015-2018 \nfederal income tax returns (SOR \u00b6 1.e); and that he failed to timely file his 2015-2021 \nstate income tax returns (SOR \u00b6 1.f). \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBankruptcies \nApplicant testified that he did not remember much about the bankruptcies \nbecause they occurred so long ago. He admitted that he filed both actions. Concerning \nthe 1986 Chapter 7 bankruptcy, he believes he was young and unwise with his finances \nback then. He also had a high interest rate home loan (15%), which made it difficult to \nkeep up with his bills and led to him filing the bankruptcy. The 1998 Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy was a different story. This was necessitated because his wife become \nseriously ill, causing her to be unable to work, so they incurred significant medical bills. \nApplicant decided that filing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy and making the payments under \nthe plan was the best course of action. He has not filed another bankruptcy since 1998. \n(Tr. at 35, 75-77; GE 7-8) \nFederal and State Income Tax Issues \nApplicant admitted that he failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for \ntax years (TY) 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. He also admitted that he failed to timely file \nhis state income tax returns for TYs 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021. He \ngave two reasons for his dilatory tax return filing history. The first reason was that in \n2015, JH, who he considered a son, passed away. The second reason was that in 2016 \nhis father passed away. He admitted that he was able to perform his military duties \nduring the time he was grieving the loss of JH and his father. He admitted that he \nignored his tax issues until about 2019 when he started communicating with the taxing \nauthorities. He did not use a tax professional when preparing his 2015-2018 federal tax \nreturns or his 2016-2021 state tax returns.

His monthly remainder is \napproximately $2,000. He admitted that he purchased a $55,000 truck in 2020 and a \n$69,000 recreational vehicle in 2023, when he had yet to address some of his tax \nissues. (Tr. 80, 82; AE A) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially applies: \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant filed for bankruptcy relief in 1986, under Chapter 7, and in 1998, under \nChapter 13. His debts were resolved each time. Applicant failed to timely file his 2015-\n2018 federal tax returns and his 2015-2021 state tax returns. He was delinquent on \npayment of his 2015-2016, and 2019 federal tax debt, and his 2015, 2019-2021 state \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \ntax debt. The record evidence supports all the SOR allegations. I find the above \ndisqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s bankruptcies are over 20 years old and would otherwise be mitigated \nby time, except for Applicant\u2019s inaction toward filing his federal and state tax returns and \ntimely paying the taxes owed. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s reasons for not filing his federal and state tax returns and paying the \namounts owed to each in a timely manner were not matters beyond his control. While \nthe loss of family member is always tragic, and many people suffer those events, it is \nnot an excuse to forego our responsibilities as citizens to file tax returns and pay taxes \nin a timely manner. \nApplicant has now filed all this federal income tax returns. I note that all of these \nreturns were filed at least two years after their due dates. The same can be said for the \nfiling of his state tax returns, with several years not being filed until August 2024. Timely \nfiling his yearly tax returns and paying what he owed was not beyond Applicant\u2019s control \nand shows irresponsibility on his part. He has paid all of his delinquent state tax debt \nand documented making continuous payments toward his federal tax debt since \nNovember 2022. He receives some mitigation credit for those actions. However, his \noverall inaction toward his tax responsibility over a number of years shows a lack of \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply and while AG \n\u00b6 20(g) is applicable, it does not overcome concerns resulting from Applicant\u2019s inaction \nwith his tax issues. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s military service, including his deployment, and the loss \nof JH in 2015 and his father in 2016. However, his inaction in handling of his tax issues \nover a multi-year period causes me to question his trustworthiness, reliability, and good \njudgment. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a - 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance. Allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are incorporated and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. Background Applicant married on February 26, 2000 and has two children from this marriage. (Item 3) She earned a master\u2019s degree in May 2015. (Item 3) Applicant reported no military service. Since March 2019, Applicant has been employed as a supply chain specialist. (Item 3) She supplements her income with work as a caregiver. Previously, she worked for other employers in various jobs. Applicant has never held a security clearance. (Item 3) 2 Applicant\u2019s finances Applicant has struggled with her finances for many years. Faced with mounting debts, she twice petitioned for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief: once in 2011 and again in 2016. (Items 8-9) Both of her bankruptcy filings were dismissed for failure to make her required plan payments: one in 2014 and the other in 2018.

The File of \nRelevant Materials (FORM) included nine exhibits (Items 1-9) that were admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant received the FORM on November 16, 2023, and timely \nsupplemented the record with additional information. Applicant\u2019s post-FORM \nsubmissions were admitted without objection as Items 10-16. This case was assigned \nto me on March 5, 2024. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly (a) is indebted to the Federal Go\n \nvernment \nfor delinquent taxes in the approximate amount of $49,349 for tax years 2009, 2015-\n2020; (c) field for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief in about September 2016; and (d) \naccumulated five delinquent consumer debts exceeding $3,100. Allegedly Applicant\u2019s \nfederal tax filing for 2021 and the alleged delinquent debts remain unresolved and \noutstanding.  \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, she admitted three of the allegations. \nSpecifically, she admitted her alleged failure-to-file her 2021 Federal income tax return, \nher alleged tax indebtedness to the federal Government; and her Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy filing with explanations. She claimed she is currently working with a tax \ngroup to establish payment arrangements she can afford. She also claimed that she \nfiled her federal tax return for 2021 through a turbo tax preparation device and received \nan emailed confirmed receipt of her filing. Applicant further claimed the Internal \nRevenue Service\u2019s (IRS) denial of receipt of her 2021 tax return allegations and her \ncontinuing efforts to correct the non-filing with the help of a working tax group. \nAddressing the alleged delinquent consumer debts covered in the SOR, she \ndenied any debts owed, claiming they have all been resolved and no longer appear on \nher credit reports. She further claimed that she has learned lessons from her Chapter \n13 bankruptcy filing and hopes to be more financially responsible in the future. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance. Allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are incorporated \nand adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. \nBackground \nApplicant married on February 26, 2000 and has two children from this marriage. \n(Item 3) She earned a master\u2019s degree in May 2015. (Item 3) Applicant reported no \nmilitary service. Since March 2019, Applicant has been employed as a supply chain \nspecialist. (Item 3) She supplements her income with work as a caregiver. Previously, \nshe worked for other employers in various jobs. Applicant has never held a security \nclearance.

Faced with mounting \ndebts, she twice petitioned for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief: once in 2011 and again in \n2016. (Items 8-9) Both of her bankruptcy filings were dismissed for failure to make her \nrequired plan payments: one in 2014 and the other in 2018. (Items 8-9) Tax records \ndocument that Applicant did not timely file her Federal income tax return for tax year \n2021. (Items 1-4, 13, and 16) Tax records also confirm that Applicant is indebted to the \nFederal Government in the approximate amount of $49,349 for tax years 2009, 2015-\n2017, 2019-2020, and 2022. (Items 1-4) In her post-FORM submissions, she \ndocumented the preparation of her 2021 federal tax return without the signature of her \ntax preparer and filing date. Whether and when her 2021 federal tax return has been \nfiled remains unclear, (Items 13 and 16)  \nEqually uncertain is the proposed payment plan her tax counselor prepared for \nher in November 2023. (Item 13) The proposed installment agreement covers a \ncalculated balance of $57,850 (inclusive of accrued interest) offers monthly terms of \n$850 and is subject to IRS approval. With an average monthly checking account \nbalance running close to $10,000 to her credit and a modest savings account to draw \nupon in emergency situations (Items 14-15) IRS approval of her payment plan, while \npromising, has yet to be finalized. Whether she can keep up her propose $850 monthly \npayments these payments (assuming IRS approval) is uncertain at this point without an \nhistorical payment track record with the IRS to raw upon. \nFurther, Applicant failed to provide any documented support for her claims that \nall of her delinquent SOR-listed consumer debts (five in all exceeding $3,100) have \nbeen paid or otherwise resolved. While her reported delinquent student loan debts (no \nlonger paused by the Department of Education (DoE)) draw some potential concern, \nthey are not covered in the SOR.

These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be \nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive \nreliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in \narriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information.

AG \u00b6 18.   \n  Burdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file her 2021 \nfederal tax return and incur over $49,000 in delinquent federal tax debts covering \nmultiple years.

See ISCR Case No. 03-01059 (App. Bd. \nSept. 24, 2004).  \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving tax-filing failures and debt \ndelinquencies are critical to an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, \nand good judgment in following rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking \naccess to classified information or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. \n14-06808 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. \n18, 2015); ISCR Case No. 14-00221 at 2-5 (App. Bd. June 29, 2016). \nWithout any evidence of Applicant\u2019s timely filing (with or without approved IRS \nextensions) of her 2021 federal tax return and paying or otherwise resolving her owed \nfederal tax and consumer debts, none of the potentially available mitigating conditions \nare fully available to her. In the past, the Appeal Board has consistently imposed \nevidentiary burdens on applicants to provide documentation corroborating actions taken \nto resolve financial problems, whether the issues relate to back taxes, consumer, \nmedical, or other debts and accounts.

Sep 26, 2019) That some or all of her SOR-listed debts no \nlonger appear on her most recent credit report, without proof of their being paid or \notherwise favorably resolved by voluntary means, cannot be afforded more than partial \nmitigation credit. In recognition of her recent initiatives, partial application of MC \u00b6 20(d), \n\u201cthe individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors \nor otherwise resolve debts,\u201d is available to her. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether her history of tax-filing lapses and debt delinquencies (both tax \nand consumer) are fully compatible with minimum standards for holding a security \nclearance. While deserving of credit for her work in the defense industry, her \ncontributions are not enough at this time to overcome her failures to address her tax-\nfiling and payment responsibilities in a timely way over the course of many years. \nOverall trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment have not been established. \nBased on a consideration of all of the facts and circumstances considered in this \ncase, it is too soon to make safe predictions that Applicant will be able to undertake \nreasoned, good-faith efforts to mitigate the Government\u2019s financial concerns within the \nforeseeable future. More time is needed for her to establish the requisite levels of \nstability with her finances to establish her overall eligibility for holding a security \nclearance. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for holding a security clearance is denied. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nGuideline F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant and his wife filed a \nChapter 13 Bankruptcy petition in October 2019 at a time when he had a tax delinquency \nfor TY 2018 and a number of delinquent consumer debts. As part of the proceeding, \nApplicant took an online financial counseling course. As of October 2023, Applicant\u2019s \nmonthly payment to the bankruptcy trustee to fund his repayments to his creditors, \nincluding the Internal Revenue Service was $1,913. Although the Trustee was successful \npaying off some of his debts and paying down others, Applicant failed to make several \npayments pursuant to the plan. He paid a total of $63,000 to the Trustee and had a total \ndelinquency of payments to the Trustee of about $30,000. In October 2023, the Trustee \nmoved to dismiss the proceeding. After speaking with advisors including his bankruptcy \nattorney, Applicant developed an alternative plan to resolve his debts outside the \nprocedures of a Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan. He was able to refinance his house with a \nlarger loan and borrow against the increased equity in his residence. On January 25, \n2024, the bankruptcy court ordered the dismissal of the Chapter 13 case at Applicant\u2019s \nrequest. He then pursued his mortgage refinance plan, which was successful. As \ndiscussed below, Applicant has resolved all of his tax and consumer debts except one, \nSOR \u00b6 1.h, which he hopes to settle in the coming weeks. (Tr. at 32-36, 88, 98, 103; GE \n4; AE A; AE K; AE L; AE Z.) \n1.b. 2009 Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Discharge Petition. Applicant and his wife discharged in \nbankruptcy about $150,000 of debts accrued by the two of them separately before they \nmarried in 2006. He was unable to pay his debts because he was underemployed \nfollowing his medical discharge from the Army in 2008. His wife suffered from a serious \nmedical condition that kept her from being employed. She remains unemployed today \ndue to her poor health. (Tr. at 24-25, 37-40, 86-87, 97; GE 5 at 24; AE A.) \n1.c. through 1.g. Federal Tax Delinquencies. As of the date of the SOR. Applicant owed \nFederal taxes in the following tax years: 1.c. $1,677 (2018); 1.d. $11,208 (2019); 1.e. \n$8,877 (2020); 1.f. $9,495 (2021); and 1.g. $2,814 (2022). In early 2024 Applicant entered \ninto a short-term payment plan with the IRS to pay $37,406 within 180 days. On April 3, \n2024, he paid all of his tax delinquencies, plus accrued interest and penalties.

Applicant resolved this debt with \na payment of $800 on April 8, 2024. (Tr. at 57-58; AE CC.) \nApplicant\u2019s income has increased dramatically over the years. Early in his post-\nArmy life, he was trying to support a family of five with an annual salary of $60,000 to \n$70,000. In 2018, his salary increased to about $100,000 and more recently, his salary \nhas increased to about $150,000. He currently earns about $166,000. He also receives \nabout $1,300 each month for his VA pension. The VA payment is not taxed. (Tr. at 58-\n62, 81, 101.)  \nApplicant has for a long time incurred significant expenses paying for the medical \ncare and prescriptions for his second wife. He has also had expenses related to his \nteenage child who has disabilities. During the 2014 to 2016 period, Applicant and his \nfamily lived in a rental home with a monthly rent of about $2,800. He began to experience \nfinancial difficulties after he purchased a home for his family in May 2016 for $623,000 \nwith a mortgage in the amount of $613,937. In November 2016, he refinanced the home \nloan in the amount of $637,100. Both loans were VA mortgage loans. The monthly \npayment on this second loan was $3,696. He found that he was incurring new debt to be \nable to pay his existing debt.

His interest rate was 3.5 percent. The \nlender put aside $140,000 of the principle of the loan into a separate non-interest bearing \naccount. Applicant was not required to pay anything on this portion of the loan. In 2020 \nor 2021 and again in 2022 or 2023, Applicant reduced his Federal Tax withholding so that \nhe could afford to pay his living expenses. (Tr. at 61-72, 99-100.) \nBefore filing his Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition, Applicant tried to work with a debt \nconsolidation company. That was not useful because the consolidated debts did not \ninclude all of his debts. He self-reported his financial difficulties to his security officer \nbefore filing for bankruptcy relief in October 2019. It turned out that the Chapter 13 \nmonthly payment plan amount was more that he could afford. He had to develop a new \nalternative to be able to continue living in his home and pay his bills. With the issuance of \nthe SOR in October 2023, his financial problems became a threat to his ability to retain \nhis security clearance. (Tr. at 25-30, 32-36, 88, 98; AE J.) \nWorking with a mortgage broker, Applicant learned that he could refinance his \nhome mortgage and borrow a substantial amount of his equity in his home. In March 2024 \nhe closed on a new mortgage in the amount of $766,500, based upon a home appraisal \nof $1,200,000. His new monthly payments, including taxes and insurance are $6,200. His \nnew interest rate is 6.625 percent. After paying off the former mortgage and financing \nexpenses, the net payout to Applicant was about $120,000. He has used that money to \npay his back taxes and to fund his settlements with eight of his nine consumer creditors. \nHe has about $45,000 remaining. He has put $20,000 of those funds in an emergency \naccount. He will use part of the remainder of the loan proceeds to pay the only unresolved \ndebt alleged in SOR, \u00b6 1.h., and any taxes he owes for TY 2023. (Tr. at 61-72, 99-100.) \nAfter the hearing, Applicant provided a budget, which reflects that his net monthly \nincome is $12,442. His budget shows monthly expenses of $3,800, a mortgage expense \nof $6,252, and a net monthly remainder of $2,390. Without any consumer debts to pay, \nApplicant believes he can afford the larger mortgage payment and pay his taxes through \nwithholding as well as his family\u2019s living expenses. (AE HH.) \nApplicant recently took an online financial counseling course that he found to be \nvery helpful. The counseling assisted him in planning to pay his taxes and to save money \nin an emergency fund. He uses an online IRS tax calculation website to help him \ndetermine how much taxes he must withhold from every paycheck to cover his annual \ntaxes. He and his wife have prepared a budget, which they use to guide their spending. \nHe intends to refinance his new mortgage with a lower monthly payment when interest \nrates decline and his credit score improves without any consumer debt.

One \nof his co-workers has known Applicant since 2008 when they were both students. All of \nthe references praise Applicant\u2019s honesty and integrity. They are aware of his financial \nstruggles as the sole income earner supporting a family of five in an area with high \nhousing costs. They praise his dedication to provide for his family while actively seeking \nto resolve his debts. They also note his integrity by reporting his financial problems to his \nsecurity officer. (AE M, AE N; AE O.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes four conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n(e) consistent spending beyond one's means or frivolous or irresponsible \nspending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other \nnegative financial indicators; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe record evidence supports all of the above potentially disqualifying \nconditions. Accordingly, the burden shifts to Applicant to mitigate security concerns \nunder Guideline F. \nThe guideline includes seven conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that can mitigate \nsecurity concerns under this guideline. The following five conditions have possible \napplication to the facts of this case. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant has established mitigation under all five conditions. Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems arose in the 2016-to-2018 time period. He incurred extraordinary expenses \ncaring for his wife and child\u2019s medical conditions. His income was insufficient to pay these \nexpenses, which were beyond his control, and the rest of his family\u2019s living expenses. He \nhad to borrow money and use credit on his credit cards to keep up with his expenses. \nThese conditions continued in what he described as a snowball rolling down a hill. He \ntried to resolve his difficulties first with debt consolidation, and then with a Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy payment plan. Neither approach provided a workable solution. With \ncounseling he found a way to borrow against the substantial equity he had in his residence \nand used the funds to pay off his consumer debts. Also, he negotiated a short-term \npayment plan with the IRS to pay his delinquent taxes, and he repaid all of his tax debts \nabout three months early. Applicant has acted responsibly under the circumstances. His \npast behavior is unlikely to recur. He is determined not to let his expenses get ahead of \nhis income. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s past financial struggles do not cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment, especially in light of his history of self-reporting \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhis financial difficulties in 2009 and again in 2019. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20 (a), (b), (d) and (g) have \nbeen fully established. \nApplicant has taken two online financial counseling courses and now has a serious \nbudget. He and his wife plan to conduct his financial affairs in a manner consistent with \nhis budget. Applicant has substantial funds in the bank for emergencies and other \nexpenses. His budget reflects a significant net remainder every month that will ensure \nthat he does not need to rely on credit to pay any extraordinary future expenses. He has \nno intention of ever using credit again to finance his family\u2019s medical needs and lifestyle. \nWithout any tax or consumer debts, Applicant can afford to pay his new, more expensive \nmortgage and provide for his family and their medical care. There are clear indications \nthat his financial problems are resolved and will not be repeated. AG \u00b6 20 (c) has been \nfully established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) he \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all pertinent facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have given significant weight to Applicant\u2019s military \ncareer and the medical reasons that resulted in his premature discharge. I have also \nweighed the strong endorsement provided by Applicant\u2019s character references. Their \nopinion of Applicant is entirely consistent of my impression of his character as evidenced \nby his testimony. At first blush, Applicant\u2019s downward financial spiral after he purchased \na home in 2016 for his family of five gave rise to a very heavy burden to mitigate his \nactions. However, when the evidence is viewed in its entirety, Applicant has satisfied that \nheavy burden and has established that he is deserving of the privilege of having his \nsecurity clearance continued so that he can serve our national defense working as a \ncontractor. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without any questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s present suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                           \n                      \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.p:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

The Government\u2019s \nevidence is identified as Items 2 through 5 (Item 1 is the SOR). Applicant did not provide \na response to the FORM or object to the government\u2019s documents. The case was \nassigned to me on August 13, 2024. Items 2 through 5 are admitted in evidence. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 28 years old. He is not married and has no children. He earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2019 and has worked for his current employer, a federal contractor, \nsince June 2019. (Item 3) \nIn January 2018, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA). \nSection 23 required he report illegal drug use in the past seven years. He disclosed that \nhe used marijuana one time in high school in September 2013. He stated, \u201cit was a one \ntime experiment.\u201d (Item 5) \nIn Applicant\u2019s January 2018 SCA, he disclosed that his background had been \npreviously investigated for security clearance eligibility, but he did not know if the \ninvestigation was completed or if he had been granted a security clearance. In June 2022, \nApplicant completed another SCA, and he disclosed he received a secret security \nclearance in February 2017 from a different government agency. (Items 3, 5) \nIn Applicant\u2019s June 2022 SCA, under Section 22 \u2013 Police Record, it required he \nreport if he had been arrested, charged, convicted, or sentenced to a crime in any court. \nHe disclosed that in January 2021, he was stopped by the police for speeding. During the \ntraffic stop he consented to have his car searched. He was arrested for unlawfully carrying \na weapon and possession of marijuana (less than 2 ounces). He hired an attorney, who \nadvised him to complete a defensive driving course and a gun safety course, and to \nprovide multiple negative drug tests results before he went to court. He completed the \nrecommendations by his attorney and the charges were dismissed. (Item 3) \nIn Applicant\u2019s June 2022 SCA, Section 23 \u2013 Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity \nrequired reporting drug use, possession, and purchase of any illegal drugs within the past \nseven years. Applicant responded \u201cno\u201d to questions that inquired if he had illegally used \ndrugs or a controlled substance in the past seven years. He responded \u201cno\u201d to the \nquestion that inquired if he had purchased any illegal drugs in the past seven years. He \nresponded \u201cno\u201d to the question if he had ever illegally used or otherwise been illegally \ninvolved with a drug or controlled substance while possessing a security clearance. (Item \n3) \nApplicant completed government interrogatories in July 2023. In them, he adopted \nand affirmed his personal subject interview with a government investigator from April \n2023. During that interview, his January 2021 arrest for unlawfully carrying a weapon and \npossession of marijuana were discussed.

He reiterated that he hired \nan attorney, who recommended he complete certain courses before going to court, which \nhe did, and the charges were subsequently dismissed. (Item 4) \nApplicant discussed his illegal drug use with the government investigator in April \n2023. He explained that the marijuana found in his car when he was arrested was left \nover from New Year\u2019s Eve when he was with his sister at her residence. It is unknown \nwhat year he was referring to. He admitted he used it on New Year\u2019s Eve, and she gave \nhim what remained (approximately less than 2 ounces). He had intended to smoke the \nmarijuana sometime in the future. After his arrest, he no longer intended to use marijuana \nin the future. (Item 4) \nApplicant told the investigator that he used marijuana socially in a cigarette form. \nHe used it in 2017 while in college and with his roommates. Since college, he has used it \nthree to four times a year with his sister, brother-in-law, and college friends. His most \nrecent use was on New Year\u2019s Eve 2022 at his sister\u2019s house, where someone brought \nand shared two marijuana cigarettes with him, his sister, brother-in-law,and other friends. \nPresumably, this is a later New Year\u2019s Eve then noted above. He told the investigator he \nhad purchased marijuana in the past approximately twice a year and under five grams for \neach purchase. He used the marijuana with others and does not use it alone. He and \nthose with whom he used marijuana, including his sister and brother-in-law, do not use \nother illegal drugs. He said he sees his sister about two to three times a month, but only \nonce or twice a year do they partake in marijuana use. He told the investigator that he \nhas spoken with his sister and told her that he does not intend to use marijuana in the \nfuture because he could lose his job. She is supportive and will ensure she does not have \nmarijuana around him. His college friends with whom he is close and used marijuana \ntogether have both moved out of state and he does not see them often. After college they \nonly used marijuana together once or twice a year if they were out together and someone \noffered it to them. (Item 4) \nApplicant was questioned about his negative responses on his 2022 SCA \nregarding his illegal drug activity. When asked why he responded \u201cno\u201d to the questions \nhe stated he was not sure. He considered that he either did not read the questions in full \nor maybe skipped them after providing the information previously on the form. He said he \nwas not attempting to hide the fact he used and purchased marijuana. He further \nspeculated that perhaps he mistakenly assumed that because he disclosed his arrest and \ncharges for possession of marijuana and the gun charge, that it was clear he used \nmarijuana. This was the third SCA he had completed, and he disclosed a one-time use \non his 2018 SCA. I do not find his vague and speculative explanations believable. (Item \n4) \nApplicant was further questioned about whether he self-reported his January 2021 \narrest to his security officer as required. He said he had not because he thought he only \nhad to disclose felony charges. He said when he was required to complete a new SCA, \nhe then realized he needed to report the offenses. He again stated he was not attempting \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto hide the information. He acknowledged he had received training on his responsibilities, \nand he should have known better. \nApplicant told the investigator that he has no intention of using marijuana again. \nHe said he has not used or possessed it since being arrested. This contradicts what he \npreviously told the investigator during the same interview, which is that he used it on New \nYear\u2019s Eve 2022, almost two years after his arrest. He told the investigator that he has \nnever felt the need to use marijuana and only used it socially if others were using it. He \nsaid it was readily available in college. He wishes he had never gotten himself in trouble, \nand he is committed to abstaining from marijuana use. He said it is not worth losing his \ncareer over. His girlfriend does not use it. 1(Item 4) \nIn response to questions in the interrogatories about Applicant\u2019s past illegal drug \nuse, he disclosed that his first use of marijuana was some time in 2016 and his last use \nwas December 2022. He reported in the interrogatories that he used marijuana socially \nthree to four times a year. He reported he does not intend to use illegal drugs in the future. \n(Item 4) \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted that from about 2016 to December \n2022, he used marijuana with varying frequency and after being granted access to \nclassified information. He admitted he purchased marijuana from 2016 to December 2022 \non various occasions. He admitted he was charged in about January 2021 with \npossession of marijuana. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c) \nApplicant stated in his SOR answer that he is on a journey dedicated to \nrehabilitation and recovery, and he has taken proactive steps to address his substance \nmisuse. He said he has disassociated with friends who are involved with illegal drugs. He \nwas willing to sign a statement affirming his commitment to complete abstinence of all \nillegal drug involvement. He did not provide a signed statement. He said he has abstained \nfrom illegal drug use for over a year and his work performance has not been affected by \nhis marijuana use. He believes this is evidence that he has taken significant strides toward \nrehabilitation and demonstrated a sincere commitment to overcoming his past \ntransgressions. \nRegarding his failure to disclose on his 2022 SCA his past illegal drug activity and \nhis failure to disclose his drug use on his 2018 SCA, Applicant stated in his SOR answer \nthat he acknowledges the seriousness of his misrepresentations made during the security \nreview process, and he fell short of the standards expected in terms of honesty and \nintegrity, and he takes full responsibility. He further stated, \u201cI took immediate and \nproactive steps to rectify the situation once I became aware of the need for correction.\u201d \nApplicant admitted in his SOR answer th\n \ne falsification allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a through \n2.d. (Item 2) He further stated: \n1 Any derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered for disqualifying \npurposes. It may be considered in the application of mitigating conditions and in a whole-person analysis. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nFollowing my arrest and charge of marijuana possession in January 2021, \nI recognized the gravity of the situation and understood the importance of \nfull disclosure in matters pertaining to my security clearance. Despite the \ncharges being dismissed by the [X] County District Attorney Office, I \npromptly reported the arrest and charges to the relevant authorities, \nincluding updating my Personnel Security Questionnaire (PSQ) and \ninforming my security officer of the events. (Item 2) \nI understand that it is not only essential to report convictions but also arrests \nand charges related to illegal activities, as they may have implications for \nsecurity clearance eligibility. Therefore, I took proactive measures to ensure \nthat all relevant information was accurately disclosed, regardless of the \noutcome of the legal proceedings.  \nMy actions in promptly reporting the arrest and charges, as well as updating \nthe necessary documentation, demonstrate my commitment to rectifying \nthe omissions and addressing the inaccuracies in my security clearance \nrecords. I acted in good faith, recognizing the importance of honesty and \ntransparency in matters concerning national security clearance. (Item 2) \nThe above statement is inconsistent with the information Applicant told the \ngovernment investigator during his April 2023 interview. Applicant did not promptly report \nhis arrest because he said he believed he was only required to report a felony charge. \nInstead, he reported his arrest on his June 2022 SCA. He did not report his illegal drug \nuse and purchases on his June 2022 SCA until he was interviewed in April 2023. He did \nnot update his documents to rectify his omissions and address inaccuracies, rather this \ninformation was discussed when he was interviewed in April 2023. Regarding Applicant\u2019s \nfailure to report his past use of marijuana on his SCA, he stated in his SOR answer: \nBy failing to report the infrequent instances of marijuana over multiple years, \nI created a regrettable pattern of falsified documents, undermining the \nintegrity of the clearance process and casting doubt on my reliability and \ntrustworthiness. (Item 2) \nApplicant further stated that his conduct was infrequent and occurred under unique \ncircumstances. He said that although it occurred over multiple years, he believed it was \nan isolated incident in an otherwise unblemished record of service. He deeply regretted \nhis actions and was ashamed of his \u201cnegligent behavior.\u201d He emphasized that his actions \nwere not indicative of a pattern of behavior or a lack of commitment to upholding the \nstandards of national security. He is remorseful for his conduct. (Item 2)  \nI find Applicant was aware that he had used marijuana more than once when he \ncompleted his January 2018 SCA and deliberately failed to disclose his additional illegal \ndrug involvement. He acknowledged he had received training on his responsibilities, and \nhe should have known better. I find he was aware he was required to report his past drug \nuse, and he deliberately failed to disclose in his June 2022 SCA his illegal use of marijiuna \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfrom 2016 to December 2022 and that his use was while he held a security clearance. \nThere is no evidence he had access to classified information.

They noted he has excelled in every role he has taken on. He \nis a great mentor and team member. He accepts accountability for his decisions and is a \nrespected responsible leader. (Item 2) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse;  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia;  \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant used marijuana from about 2016 to at least December 2022. Applicant \nheld a security clearance at the time but there is insufficient evidence that he had access \nto classified information. AG \u00b6 25(f) does not apply. He purchased marijuana on various \noccasions from about 2016 to at least December 2022. In January 2021 he was charged \nwith possession of marijuana. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom drug involvement and substance misuse. The following mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and\n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s SOR answer, he said he last used marijuana in December \n2022, specifically New Year\u2019s Eve. Although he stated he is committed to abstaining from \nfuture use of marijuana, he was not deterred after he was arrested for possession of \nmarijuana in January 2021. He continued to use it even after he completed another SCA \nin June 2022, which was a reminder that illegal drug use is inconsistent with federal \nemployment. Because Applicant requested a determination on the record without a \nhearing, I had no opportunity to question him about his illegal drug use or evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity about discontinuing his drug use based on demeanor. See ISCR \nCase No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). At this time, there is insufficient \nevidence to conclude that there is an established pattern of abstinence and sufficient time \nhas passed to conclude future use is unlikely. AG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply. Although there \nis some mitigation under AG \u00b6 26(b), that is he no longer associates with his friends with \nwhom he used marijuana, and he has asked his sister to not use it in his presence, it is \ninsufficient to fully mitigate Applicant\u2019s illegal drug involvement. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility:  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant deliberately falsified the full extent of his illegal drug use on his January \n2018 SCA by stating he used marijuana one time in 2013. He deliberately falsified \nrelevant facts on his June 2022 SCA when he answered \u201cno\u201d to the questions which asked \nif in the past seven years he had used illegal drugs and purchased illegal drugs. He again \nanswered \u201cno\u201d to the question if he had ever used illegal drugs while possessing a security \nclearance, which was also false. I find all his falsifications were deliberate. The above \ndisqualifying condition applies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom personal conduct. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n17: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose the extent of his illegal drug use on his \nJanuary 2018 SCA. He had an opportunity to correct his omissions on his June 2022 SCA \nbut exacerbated his situation by omitting additional relevant information when he denied \nany illegal drug use and purchase of illegal drugs in the past seven years. This was \ncompounded by failing to disclose that his illegal drug use occurred while holding a \nsecurity clearance. He did disclose he was charged in January 2021 for possession of \nmarijuana. His explanations for failing to disclose his past involvement with illegal drugs \nwere not believable. His repeated falsifications are not minor offenses. \nApplicant did not make a prompt good-faith effort to correct his falsification but \nrather continued his conduct when he falsified his responses on his June 2022 SCA. \nAlthough Applicant is remorseful for his conduct and seems to accept the gravity of his \nactions, the security clearance process relies on those who are trusted with our nation\u2019s \nsecrets to be honest and forthcoming regardless of the consequences. He failed to be \nhonest on his January 2018 SCA and exacerbated it by continuing to falsify relevant facts \non his June 2022 SCA. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse and Guideline E, \npersonal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant (excepting the words \n\u201cto include after being granted access to \nclassified information.\u201d)  \nSubparagraphs 2.b-2.d: \nAgainst Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Since May of 2023, he has \nbeen making monthly payments of $540 towards his back-taxes, and currently owes \nabout $28,092. (TR at page 19 line 19 to page 24 line 15, at page 31 line 9 to page 36 \nline 11, and AppX A at pages 7~10.) \n1.o. Applicant admits that he owes back taxes, for tax years 2014 and 2015, to \nhis state, but denies the amount alleged. (TR at page 24 line 22 to page 29 line 25.) It \nalleges that he owes $12,721, but has submitted documentation that through a payment \nplan his state tax debt has been reduced to $9,306. (Answer at pages 14~16.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Four are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has significant past-due indebtedness. He also had Federal and state \nincome tax delinquencies. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying \nconditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAlthough Applicant can attribute his financial difficulties to periods of \nunderemployment and to a divorce, his financial problems are ongoing. Applicant has a \nlong history of delinquencies, dating back at least eight years to his 2015 tax \ndelinquencies, and he still has over $10,000 in past-due debt he has yet to address. \nApplicant has not demonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. Mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6 20 has not been sufficiently established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant \nperforms well at his job. (AppX A the last page.) Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwith questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial \nConsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g. and 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i~1.o: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

She has worked for her current \nemployer since about July 2022. From 2008 until 2021, she was employed as a federal \nemployee at another federal medical center until she resigned in about March 2021, \nafter receiving a Notice of Proposed Removal, and being barred from the military base \nwhere she worked. She earned a high school diploma in 1990. She has been married \nsince 2007 but was legally separated in about 2019. She has no children. (Items 4, 5, 9, \n10) \nBetween 1992 and 2020, Applicant was arrested 12 times, including six arrests \nfor theft. Her other arrests involved, among other things, destruction of property (1992 \nand 1993), illegal drug possession charges (1995 and 1997), intimidating a juror (1995), \nand forgery of financial documents (1995, twice in 2006, 2020). She was found guilty of \nforgery and grand theft in 1995, found guilty of violating a protective order in 2000, and \nfound guilty of theft and forgery in April and in May 2006. \nApplicant\u2019s most recent arrest, in 2020, involved multiple counts of theft and \nfraud she committed in 2019. In March 2022, she pleaded guilty to a felony charge of \nidentity theft and the remaining charges were dismissed. She is on probation for that \nfelony conviction until sometime later this year. She has completed her restitution \npayments that were part of her sentence. Her probation officer wrote a letter stating that \nApplicant has been compliant with her restitution payments and the other terms of her \nprobation. She admitted the SOR allegations regarding her arrests with additional \ncomments, except she denied the arrest that led to her felony conviction because the \nSOR alleged an incorrect date of arrest. The SOR alleges that she was arrested in \nMarch 2020, but she was arrested at a later date. However, she has admitted the \nunderlying conduct that led to this arrest. (Items 2-8; FORM Response) \nThe conduct that resulted in her March 2022 felony conviction for identity theft \ninvolved her stealing credit cards from co-workers and using them to make \nunauthorized charges on those cards. She also opened additional credit-card accounts \nin those co-workers\u2019 names without their knowledge and consent. Her supervisor opined \nthat, because Applicant had stolen personally identifiable information, she had lost \nconfidence in Applicant\u2019s ability to maintain sensitive information and provided her with \na notice of intent to remove her from her employment. Before Applicant could be \nterminated, she resigned, because she had been physically barred from accessing the \nmilitary base where she worked. (Items 2-9; FORM Response) \nSeveral of Applicant\u2019s arrests involved financial crimes such as forging checks \nand falsifying signatures on financial documents. She filed a petition in Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy in 2019 and had about $40,000 of unsecured debt discharged in about \nFebruary 2020. A February 2023 credit report reflects no delinquent accounts.

In September 2019, she received a \nLetter of Reprimand for absence without leave and failure to comply with leave \nprocedures. (Items 2-5, 9, 10; FORM Response) \nDespite being required to do so, Applicant failed to list her 2020 resignation and \nsuspension and her 2019 Letter of Reprimand on her certified 2022 Electronic \nQuestionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). Despite being required to do so, \nshe also failed to disclose her 1997 and 1995 illegal drug possession arrests on the e-\nQIP. She disclosed her 2022 felony conviction on the e-QIP. During a 2022 personal \nsubject interview (PSI), she told a DOD investigator that she left her job in 2021 \nbecause she was embarrassed by an incident involving someone\u2019s identity. She \nclaimed that she was not fired or asked to quit, and that she was available for re-hire. \nShe did not tell the DOD investigator about being put on notice that she would be \nterminated or about being denied access to the military base until she was confronted. \nShe claimed that she did not intentionally fail to disclose this information in the e-QIP, \nbut believes these failures were caused by problems with the computer she used to \ncomplete the e-QIP. She volunteered some of her drug use to the DOD investigator \nbefore being confronted. However, she did not volunteer her drug arrests before being \nconfronted. (Items 2-10; FORM Response) \nApplicant claimed that she has learned from her mistakes, has matured, and will \nno longer engage in any similar wrongdoing. With respect to any inconsistencies in her \nreporting of derogatory information, she claims that she has either forgotten or \u201cchosen \nto forget\u201d many of the details from her criminal past. She provided character-reference \nletters from co-workers claiming that she is dependable, hard-working, has good \ncharacter, and always fosters a positive work environment. She provided a financial \nstatement, pay stubs from her employer, and a letter of appreciation for her work during \na government blood drive. (Items 2, 4, 5; FORM Response) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became effective on June 8, \n2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nsensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe trustworthiness concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may \nbe disqualifying. The following is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nThere is substantial evidence that Applicant engaged in a pattern of criminal \nbehavior from about 1995 until 2019. The above referenced disqualifying condition is \nestablished, thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct trustworthiness concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nAs it has been about five years since Applicant\u2019s latest arrest, at first blush, it \nappears that a significant amount of time has passed since she engaged in criminal \nbehavior. However, this amount of time without criminal conduct pales in comparison to \nthe time over which she engaged in crimes. She is still on probation for her latest \nconviction, and that crime involved deceit, theft, and dishonesty. There is reliable \nevidence in the form of investigative reports and her admissions that she engaged in \nthis behavior. There is no bright-line rule for how much time must elapse to make \ncriminal behavior unlikely to recur or to establish evidence of successful rehabilitation. \nHowever, given the nature, number, and frequency of her actions, I have questions and \ndoubts regarding her reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and \n32(c) are not applicable. AG \u00b6 32(d) has some applicability because of her good \nemployment record, volunteer activities, restitution, and probation compliance. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing \ndeceptive loan statements and other intentional breaches of financial trust. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant filed a petition in Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2019, and a significant \namount of her unpaid debt was discharged in 2020.

The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nThe allegation surrounding Applicant\u2019s Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing has been \nmitigated by the passage of time without additional delinquent accounts, making those \ndelinquencies unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) applies to that SOR allegation. I also find for \nApplicant with respect to the portion of SOR \u00b6 2.a that cross-alleged \u00b6\u00b6 1.e. and 1.h. \nunder Guideline F, because there is no evidence those cross-alleged crimes involve \nfinancial wrongdoing. Therefore, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.h are not established under \nGuideline F. \nFor the reasons I indicated in my analysis under Guideline J, I do not find that \nApplicant\u2019s other financial crimes are unlikely to recur, and they cause me to question \nher reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. None of the mitigating paragraphs \napply to the financial crimes alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d, that were cross-alleged \nunder Guideline F, SOR \u00b6 2.a. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe trustworthinesconcern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthinessconcerns \nunder AG \u00b6 16. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \nThe Government has cross-alleged all the Guideline J and Guideline F \nparagraphs under Guideline E. As those allegations are sufficient for an adverse \ndetermination under both of those Guidelines, they are not established under Guideline \nE. \nIn 2021, Applicant was barred from entering the military base where she worked \nbecause she stole her co-workers\u2019 identity. The same employer disciplined her in 2020 \nand 2019. AG \u00b6 16(d) is established. \nApplicant deliberately omitted information from the e-QIP regarding her \nemployment discipline in 2019, 2020, and 2021, as well as her 1997 and 1995 drug-\nrelated arrests. She claimed that she did not intentionally omit this information or that \nshe had computer problems. However, her significant criminal history involving \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \ndishonest and deceitful behavior, and her inconsistent statements to the investigator \nduring the PSI about the reason for her resignation in 2019 cause me to question the \nveracity of her reporting. AG \u00b6 16(a) is established. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply in Applicant's case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nNone of the Guideline E mitigating conditions apply to Applicant\u2019s employment \ndiscipline from 2019 through 2021. Her behavior in violating her employer\u2019s rules is \nconsistent with her other failures to follow laws and rules and causes me to question her \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. These failures to follow rules are not \ninfrequent nor unusual, so I do not find that they are unlikely to recur. There is no \nevidence that she has obtained counseling to correct this behavior. \nNone of the Guideline E mitigating conditions apply to Applicant\u2019s failure to report \nher 2021 employment discipline and her 1997 and 1995 drug-related arrests on the e-\nQIP. Deliberately omitting relevant information from a security questionnaire is not \nminor. She did not volunteer the omitted information before being confronted with it. She \ndid not acknowledge this deceitful behavior. Instead of telling the truth to the \ninvestigator after being confronted, she lied again and told the investigator that she \nresigned in 2021 because of \u201cembarrassment,\u201d and failed to mention her theft of her co-\nworker\u2019s identity until confronted. For these reasons, I do not find that her behavior is \nunlikely to recur, and I question her reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines J, F, and E in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered her \nfavorable character references. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. I conclude Applicant did \nnot mitigate the criminal conduct, financial considerations, or personal conduct \ntrustworthiness concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.l: \nAgainst \nApplicant \nwith \nthe \nexception of the date of arrest \nlisted in paragraph 1.b, that \noccurred on a later date. \nParagraph 2, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst \nApplicant \nwith \nthe \nexception \nof \ncross-alleged \nparagraphs 1.e and 1.h, which \nwere not established. \nSubparagraph 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nSubparagraphs 3.b-3.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \npublic trust position.

The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 18, 2023, and elected to have her case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.

The case was assigned to me on \nAugust 5, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admits the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h and 1.i. She denies \nthe SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 54 years old. She earned an associate\u2019s degree 1996, a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in 1999, and a master\u2019s degree in 2010. She never married. She has two grown \nchildren. In her October 2022 security clearance application (SCA) she reported her \nemployment history. She disclosed that from 1989 to 2001 and 2011 to 2020 she worked \nas a contractor for the federal government. From 2005 to the present, she also has been \nself-employed with one business, and from 2015 to the present she has been also self-\nemployed with a second business. She reported being employed from November 2011 \nto the present by a non-federal company. She explained that she has worked on various \ngovernment contracts for the federal government over the past 20 years and before then \nshe was a full-time federal employee. She is currently employed as an independent \ncontractor for a company sponsoring her for security clearance. (Item 3) \nThe SOR alleges that in October 2012, Applicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy and \nhad her debts discharged in February 2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.i); that in July 2017 she filed Chapter \n13 bankruptcy, and it was dismissed in May 2018 for failure to make payment plans (SOR \n\u00b6 1.h); and that in May 2019, she filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy and it was dismissed in \nSeptember 2020 for failure to make payment plans (SOR \u00b6 1.g). The SOR also alleges \ndelinquent debts totaling approximately $22,528 for various consumer debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nthrough 1.f). The debts are corroborated by Applicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR, \nstatements made to a government investigator, bankruptcy documents, and credit reports \nfrom September 2023, December 2022, and January 2022. (Items 2 through 10) \nApplicant attributed her 2012 Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing and subsequent \ndischarge to a bad economy in 2008 that reduced her contract work and being a single \nmother. She fell behind on her bills and filed for bankruptcy. In her March 2023 statement \nto a government investigator, she explained she filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy due to \nlack of income after she went back to college to obtain a master\u2019s degree. (Items 2, 4) \nApplicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in July 2017. She explained in her SOR \nanswer that she filed bankruptcy due to a decrease in her monthly workload and her \nmonthly expenses increased. Specifically, she said the interest rate on her home \nmortgage increased, and she began to struggle financially. She filed bankruptcy to save \nher home. She explained she made the $214 monthly payments but there was a \nmiscommunication with her attorney and the bankruptcy was dismissed in May 2018.

She was to make $360 monthly payments. She told the government investigator \nshe made these payments until the COVID pandemic decreased her work, and she could \nnot afford them. The bankruptcy was dismissed in September 2020 for failure to make \nthe required monthly payments. Applicant told the investigator that in February 2023, she \nreached out to a credit repair law firm that would go over her credit report and dispute \ndebts she did not owe. She did not provide evidence that she hired the firm and is working \ntowards resolving any disputed debts. (Items 2, 4) \nApplicant disclosed on her October 2022 SCA the 2012 Chapter 7 bankruptcy and \nshe wrote that all of her debts were discharged except her student loans. She disclosed \nher 2017 Chapter 13 bankruptcy and checked the box \u201cyes\u201d regarding if her debts were \ndischarged. She stated, \u201cI believe things are still in the process of being finalized. I went \nto court on 1/26/2018.\u201d In response to the question, \u201cIn the last (7) seven years, have you \nfiled any additional petitions under any chapter of the bankruptcy code,\u201d she responded \n\u201cno.\u201d She did not report her May 2019 Chapter 13 bankruptcy or that her 2017 bankruptcy \nwas not discharged but rather dismissed. She did not report any delinquent debts under \nSection 26. (Item 3) \nApplicant reported to the government investigator that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($827) \nwas with a cell phone company. She told the investigator she disputed this debt because \nshe lost her cell phone and had to get a replacement, and she did not feel she should \nhave to pay for the lost phone and the replacement phone. She did not want to pay the \ndebt, but if she had to, it would be her lowest priority. In her SOR answer, she said she \ndisputed the debt because she believed she was overcharged for a service she no longer \nreceived. She said when she lost her cell phone, she replaced it with an old phone she \nowned and that she did not have a charge with the company for that phone. She had \nplans to resolve the problem with the company but then the company was sold. She said \nshe was still disputing the debt. In her SOR answer she said she was disputing the debt, \nand she had contracted with a credit repair law firm to handle it. She provided no \nsupporting documentation. The debt is not resolved. (Items 2, 4) \nApplicant denied owing the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b ($3,579). She told the government \ninvestigator she thought the balance owed on his account was too high because it \nexceeded her credit limit.

She said she would pay \nthe debt when she is able but was unable at that time. In her SOR answer, she said that \nshe had not made arrangements to resolve the debt. She said the credit repair law firm \nwas to handle it but she was unable to pay them because her work had slowed. The debt \nis unresolved.

(Items 2, 4) \nApplicant denied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e ($5,712) for a collection account.

In her SOR answer \nshe said she did not know why she had three accounts with the same creditor and was \nunfamiliar with this account. She said it was removed from her credit report. She did not \nprovide any documentary evidence to support her claims. It is unresolved. (Items 2, 4) \nApplicant admitted the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f ($609) was delinquent. She told the \ngovernment investigator that she was responsible for his debt and it was at the top of her \npriorities to pay it when she is able. In her SOR answer, she said her ex-boyfriend was \nsupposed to pay it and did not. The account was in her name, and she understood she \nwas responsible to pay it. She said she needed time to get her finances back in order \nnow that her work has increased. She did not provide evidence of her attempt to resolve \nthis debt. It is unresolved. (Items 2, 4) \nIn her SOR answer, Applicant stated that she \u201cpays her bills for the most part on \ntime or at least they get paid when the funds are available to pay the bills.\u201d She further \nstated, \u201cI just had a few financial obligations that became overwhelming for me at a time \nor two.\u201d She said she could not be blackmailed or coerced or placed under duress due to \nher financial hardships. She said, \u201cI plan to pay the accounts that are outstanding such \nas [SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 1.f].\u201d (Item 2) \nAny derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered \nfor disqualifying purposes. It may be considered when applying mitigating conditions and \nin a whole-person analysis. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had her delinquent debts discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2013. \nShe filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in July 2017 and again in May 2019. Both were \ndismissed for failing to make the required monthly payments. Applicant has numerous \ndelinquent debts that she has not paid. There is sufficient evidence to support the \napplication of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e)the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \nApplicant has a long history of financial problems. After having her debts \ndischarged in bankruptcy in 2013, she again accumulated delinquent debts. She filed \nChapter 13 bankruptcy twice, both were dismissed for failing to make the required \nmonthly payments. Applicant did not provide evidence that she has resolved any of the \nalleged debts in the SOR. Her debts are recent and ongoing. There is no evidence she \nhas taken financial counseling beyond likely the mandatory counseling when filing for \nbankruptcy. She disputes certain debts but failed to provide any documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of her dispute or attempts to resolve them. She has not provided \nevidence of a good-faith effort to resolve any of the debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(c), 20(d), and \n20(e) do not apply. \nApplicant indicated her financial problems were due to the 2008 economic \ndownturn, underemployment, lack of contract work which decreased her income, and the \nCOVID pandemic. In Applicant\u2019s 2023 interview with a government investigator, she said \nthat she went back to school in 2010 and did not earn any income. This was a choice and \nnot beyond her control. Because of her lack of income, she filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in \n2012 and her debts were discharged in 2013. Her underemployment and reduced work \ndue to the pandemic were beyond her control. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), \nApplicant must have acted responsibly under the circumstances. There is scant evidence \nthat she has made efforts to resolve her delinquent debts. Because Applicant requested \na determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to question her \nabout her past and current financial status or evaluate her credibility and sincerity based \non demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). AG \u00b6 20(b) \nhas minimal application. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant is responsible for presenting evidence in mitigation. She failed to meet \nher burden of persuasion. If there is any doubt concerning personnel being considered \nfor national security eligibility, I am required to resolve that doubt in favor of the national \nsecurity. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960); Department of Defense DoD) Directive \n5220.6 Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, (January 2, \n1992) (Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A \nthe National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, \n2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (undated) and requested a hearing. This case \nwas assigned to me on January 4, 2024. A hearing was scheduled for February 2, \n2024, via Microsoft Teams Teleconference Services, and was heard as scheduled. At \nthe hearing, the Government\u2019s case consisted of five exhibits. (GEs 1-5) Applicant \nrelied on one witness (herself) and no exhibits. The transcript (Tr.) was received on \nFebruary 9, 2024. \nProcedural Issues \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to \npermit him the opportunity to supplement the record with updates on the status of his \ndebts and any settlement arrangements he was able to make with his creditors. For \ngood cause shown, Applicant was granted 30 days to supplement the record. \nDepartment Counsel was afforded three days to respond. (Tr. 84) Within the time \npermitted, Applicant supplemented the record with a documented excel spreadsheet, a \ncredit repair contract, a divorce decree covering his divorce from his first wife, and a \npayoff of his SOR \u00b6 1.h debt. Applicant\u2019s submissions were admitted without objections \nas AEs A-D. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F of the SOR, Applicant allegedly accumulated 20 delinquent \nconsumer debts exceeding $48,000. Allegedly, these delinquent accounts have not \nbeen resolved and remain outstanding. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the debts with \nexplanations. Accepting personal responsibility for all of his admitted debts, he denied \nthe alleged debts covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.h, 1.q, and 1.t, claiming uncertainty over \nwhether the debts belonged to him. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance. Admitted facts are adopted and incorporated by reference. Additional \nfindings of fact follow. \nBackground \nApplicant married in March 2017 and divorced in March 2020. (GE 1; Tr. 20, 24) \nHe has two biological children: one from his first marriage (age 5) and another from a \nprior relationship (age 8). (GE 1; Tr. 24-26) Both children reside with their respective \nmothers and receive monthly child support from Applicant. (Tr. 25-29) Applicant \nremarried in June 2022 and separated in 2023. (GE 1; Tr. Tr. 33) His current wife has \nthree biological children of her own from a previous marriage and three adopted \nchildren, for whom Applicant has no legal responsibility for their care and upbringing. \n(GE 1; 30-31) Applicant and his current wife are living apart and anticipate their \nmarriage will ultimately end in divorce.

(GE 1; Tr. 34) Previously, he worked for \nother employers in various jobs. (GE 1) He reported brief unemployment in 2021. (GE \n1) Applicant has never held a security clearance.  (GE 1)  \nApplicant\u2019s finances \nBetween 2017 and 2022, Applicant accumulated 20 delinquent debts exceeding \n$48,000. (GEs 1-5) He attributed his debt delinquencies to overspending during his first \nmarriage, citing expensive cars and housing. (GE 2; Tr. 44) In his words, his debts just \n\u201cavalanched.\u201d (Tr. 42) Under the terms of his March 2020 divorce decree, Applicant and \nhis wife were each assigned respective responsibilities for specific marrital debts. (GE 2 \nand AE C) The debts assigned to Applicant were considerable and limited his ability to \nresolve them in a timely way. (GEs 1-2) \nAcknowledging the debts assigned to him by his divorce decree, Applicant \naccepts full responsibility for his debts. His assigned debts are comprised of the \nfollowing: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a (a consumer account for $7,591); 1.b (a revolving credit card \naccount for $5,977); 1.c (a credit card account for $5,462); 1.d (a credit card account for \n$5,416); 1.e (a personal loan for $5,175); 1.f (a digital retail account for $3,879); 1.g (a \ncredit card account for $2,509); 1.h (a an auto loan for $2,100); 1.i (a credit card \naccount for $1,514); 1.j (a credit card account for $1,395); 1.k (a credit card account for \n$1,124); 1.l-1-p and 1.r (unknown family debts assigned to him from his divorce \nexceeding $1,300); 1.q (a cell phone account for $161); 1.s (child support arrears \napproximating $4,096); and 1.t (a utility account for $54). (GEs 1-5; Tr. 56-71) \nSince his finalized divorce from his first wife in 2020, Applicant has addressed \nonly two of the delinquent debts covered in the SOR. Based on his testimony and \npayment documentation, he is credited with paying off the automotive debt covered by \nSOR \u00b6 1.h. (AE D; Tr. 42) His recent engagement of a credit repair service, while \nencouraging, has not produced any tangible results in resolving his delinquent \naccounts. \nApplicant\u2019s monthly child support obligations cover both of his biological sons. \n(GE 2; Tr. 25-26) With respect to the mother of his son from a prior relationship, he has \na standard custody agreement under which he has bi-weekly monthly child support \nobligations of $200. (Tr. 27) Applicant\u2019s ordered monthly child support obligations to the \nchild of his first marriage run $400 a month for current support and include designated \namounts applied to arrears. (GE 2 and AE C; Tr. 29) Applicant is credited with being in \ncompliance with his state\u2019s court-ordered withholding of calculated owed child support \n(both current and arrears) from his bi-weekly pay-check. (GE 2 and AE C; Tr. 29) \nApplicant currently earns $66,000 from his work. (GE 3; Tr. 34) His monthly \ngross approximates $5,425. (GE 3; Tr. 49) After deductions, (inclusive of his monthly \nchild support withholding) his net monthly take-home pay is $2,968.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. \nThese guidelines include conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of the conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be considered before deciding \nwhether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, \nthe guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n Financial Considerations \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information.

AG \u00b6 18. \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information.

While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position.

With the exception of the debts covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.h and 1.s, which are favorably resolved, he has made no documented progress to \ndate in resolving his listed SOR debts. While his recent engagement of a credit repair \nservice to help him with his debts is encouraging, his debts at this time remain for the \nmost part unresolved and outstanding. None of the potentially available mitigating \nconditions apply to his situation. \nWell-intentioned promises, aided by creditor repair services, while encouraging, \ncannot be substituted for a voluntary, good faith track record of payments.

The DCSA CAS acted \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on \nJune 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on September 12, 2023, and elected to have his \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.

On \nOctober 25, 2023, a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was sent to \nApplicant, who was given an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, \nextenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s evidence.

Item \n1, which includes the SOR and Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, is already part of the \nadministrative record. Items 2 through 9 are admitted in evidence without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted all allegations in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through \n1.n). His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. After careful review of the \nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 37 years old. In August 2005, he enrolled in college and earned his \nbachelor\u2019s degree in May 2012. He continued his education from June to August 2013, \nbut did not earn a second degree or certificate. He married in 2011 and has two minor \nchildren, ages 9 and 11. (Item 2) \nApplicant has worked full time as a senior information technology (IT) specialist for \na defense contractor since January 2021. He previously worked as a full-time IT \nprofessional for a state government employer from November 2019 to January 2021. He \nwas unemployed from June 2018 until November 2019, and prior to that, he worked as a \nfull-time wire technician for a private company from May 2017 until June 2018. From April \nto May 2017, he worked as a technical support contractor. He became unemployed from \nNovember 2016 until April 2017 after leaving his full-time position in retail management. \n(Item 2) It is unclear whether Applicant ever received unemployment benefits, or any other \nspecial federal or state financial support. He and his wife filed a voluntary Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy petition in August 2016. Their debts were discharged in December 2016. \n(Items 2, 4, and 6-9) \nApplicant completed his SCA in November 2021 and disclosed the above listed \nbankruptcy action, his unpaid 2018 federal income tax of $6,451 and his 2015 delinquent \nstate income tax of $520, which was resolved in August 2021 by wage garnishment. \nRegarding his unpaid 2018 federal income tax, Applicant stated that he was missing a \nform from his original taxes and that he \u201cwasn\u2019t working at the time and I didn\u2019t have the \nmoney to satisfy the debt.\u201d Regarding his delinquent 2015 state income tax, he explained \nthat his pay was low at the time and he was trying to provide for his family. (Items 2 and \n3) In his December 2021 background interview, he stated that he would contact the IRS \nin 2022 to set up payment arrangements to pay his federal delinquent income tax debt. \n(Item 3) He attributed his financial situation to employment instability, including being in \nbetween jobs, losing a job due to an accident at work, and going through a period where \nhe struggled to find work.

(Item 5 at 13). He did not submit any documentary evidence to \nsupport his case in mitigation.  \nIn March 2023, Applicant disclosed he earned a net monthly salary of $3,400 and \nthat his wife earned the same net monthly amount, for a combined net monthly income of \n$6,800 for the household. Deducting monthly expenses, the net monthly remainder for \nhis household totaled about $4,226. (Item 5 at 15) He did not disclose information about \nhis assets in his personal financial statement. No checking and savings account \ninformation was provided. (Id.) Applicant\u2019s pay record shows that he actively contributes \na percentage of his earnings to his employer\u2019s 401(k) retirement plan. (Item 5 at 14) In \nhis December 2021 background interview, he described his current financial situation as \nstable and stated that he is willing and able to pay his delinquent debts. (Item 3 at 4) \nThe evidence for all allegations in the SOR is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: Applicant admitted this debt to the federal government for his 2018 \nunpaid income taxes. The alleged tax debt, originally $6,451.90 on the IRS form, \nincreased to $7,300.06 due to accrued interest and penalties. (Item 5 at 30; and SOR \nAnswer) He did not submit documentary evidence to show the current status of the debt. \nThis debt is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: Applicant admitted he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and that his debts \nwere discharged in 2016. (SOR Answer) In his voluntary petition, the estimated combined \nliabilities for Applicant and his wife were between $100,001 and $500,000. (Item 4) \nApplicant\u2019s independent and joint student loan accounts, which were listed in the petition \nas unsecured creditor claims, totaled about $119,000. (Item 4 at 10-12, 15-16) His more \nrecent student loan balances, which were listed as being in a collection status in March \n2023, exceeded $120,000 in value. (Item 5 at 3-5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: Applicant admitted this delinquent debt, originally alleged as a past-\ndue account of $412. This debt was ultimately charged off for $5,579 in September 2023. \n(Item 9 at 9) This debt is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: Applicant admitted this delinquent debt, originally alleged as a past-\ndue account of $448. The record evidence indicates this debt is now current and being \npaid as agreed. (Item 9 at 8) This debt is being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e through 1.l: Applicant admitted the delinquent debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.e through 1.l in his Answer. Six of the eight delinquent debts are consumer accounts. \nThe other two are a student loan and a medical account. All allegations are supported by \ncredit bureau reports from 2021, 2022, and 2023 and Applicant\u2019s statements about these \ndebts during his background interview. (See Item 3, and Items 5-8) \nPer the record, Applicant apparently disputed the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.g, \nwith the respective creditors.

Both debts are supported by the 2021 and 2022 credit bureau reports (Items 6 \nand 7) However, in his March 2023 interrogatory response, Applicant stated he paid these \ndebts of $65 and $40, respectively, but he did not include documentary evidence. (Item \n5 at 9-10) These delinquent debts do not appear in the 2023 credit bureau reports. (Items \n8 and 9) These debts are resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d EO 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d EO 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. \nBd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan at 531. See also AG \n\u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially relevant in this case: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer, four credit bureau reports, his Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy petition, and statements made during his background investigation establish \nthe three above disqualifying conditions under this guideline. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6  20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(c), and 20(d) are not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are \nrecent, ongoing, and remain unresolved. He has not produced evidence of recent \nfinancial counseling, contacts with creditors, payments, payment plans, or any other \nevidence of efforts made to resolve his delinquent debts. He also failed to establish that \nhe initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay his delinquent debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established.

Moreover, Applicant has been gainfully employed since \nJanuary 2021, and his household income at the end of the month after all bills are paid \nexceeds $4,200. He has had the financial means to address his delinquent accounts, but \nfor unknown reasons he has not. It is noted that he actively participates in his employer\u2019s \n401(k) retirement plan, though the plan\u2019s worth is unknown. There is no indication that \nApplicant has acted responsibly, or that he has taken meaningful steps to substantively \naddress his delinquent debts. He failed to provide sufficient evidence to mitigate financial \nconsiderations security concerns in this case though he is credited with addressing three \nof 14 financial concerns. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Although the record indicates Applicant previously \ndisputed two debts with the creditors, he did not present this as an argument in his \nAnswer. Neither did he offer evidence to support a reasonable basis to dispute any of his \ndelinquent debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is not established. Though Applicant stated during his background \ninterview that he would contact the IRS in 2022 to establish a payment plan to satisfy his \ndelinquent federal income tax debt, there is no evidence that he ever took this action. He \ndid not offer proof he paid off his delinquent federal income taxes. Nor did he offer proof \nthat he is complying with payment arrangements made with the IRS. It is noted that \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent state income tax debt was satisfied only after the state government \ntook action to garnish his wages after five years. \nThere is insufficient evidence in this case to make a determination that Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial problems will be resolved within a reasonable period of time. I am unable to find \nthat he acted responsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to \npay his debts. His financial issues continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. I find that financial considerations security concerns \nremain unresolved despite the presence of some mitigation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate security concerns based on financial considerations.  \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e - 1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m \u2013 1.n: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

He cited having to pay two major car repairs \nand living expenses for his new child as his reason for not filing. (Item 6 at 5.) In response \nto Government interrogatories, he also cited the car repairs and stated he had filed the \n2020 return and was moving on to his 2021 return. (Item 4 at 2-3.) He did not provide \nstate tax account transcripts as requested by the Government in their interrogatories. \n(Item 4 at 2.) In his Answer he stated the tax returns had been \u201cfiled/finalized;\u201d however, \nhe did not provide any documentary evidence to corroborate this claim. (Item 2.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15- 01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . Affluence that cannot be explained \nby known sources of income is also a security concern insofar as it may \nresult from criminal activity, including espionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the record establish the \nfollowing disqualifying condition under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s unfiled tax returns are recent and did not \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \noccur under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. He has not demonstrated he \nhas acted responsibly. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant attributed his current tax issues to two car \nrepair issues and a new child. The conditions, while possibly beyond his control, may \nhave impacted his ability to pay his tax obligation, but they did not cause his failure to file \nhis Federal and state taxes as required. He has not acted responsibly.  \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is not established. Applicant offered no evidence he had recently filed \nhis tax returns for the years in question as he claimed. He did not provide the state \ntranscripts requested by the Government, which could support his claim of having filed \nhis 2020 state tax return. His Federal tax account transcripts both reflect no tax return \nfiled. Applicant\u2019s repeated failure to fulfill his legal obligations does not demonstrate the \nhigh degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to classified \ninformation. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08782 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 5, 2017). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his failure to timely file his \nFederal and state income tax returns. \nFormal Findings \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(Item 1) On July 10, 2023 Applicant provided a response to the \nSOR, and requested a decision based upon the administrative record (Answer). (Item 1) \nA copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated July 21, 2023, was provided \nto Applicant. Department Counsel attached as evidence to the FORM Items 1 through 6. \nApplicant received the FORM on August 9, 2023, and she was afforded a period of 30 \ndays to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. She \ntimely submitted her Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition she completed in August 2023, which \nI labeled as Applicant\u2019s Exhibt (AE) A.

Pursuant to the Department of Defense (DOD) Directive \n5220.6 \u00b6 E.3.1.13, I agree the amended changes are necessary to accurately reflect that \nApplicant is in process for national security eligibility for access to classified information \nrather than eligilbity for access to sensitive information. Accordingly, the amendment is \nadopted without objection. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 38 years old.

(AE \nA) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nThe record evidence of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts and her admissions establish \nthe following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nproblem form a legitimate and credible, source such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis or provides evidence or actions to resolve \nthe issue. \nApplicant bears the burden of production and persuasion in mitigation. An \napplicant is not held to a standard of perfection in his or her debt-resolution efforts or \nrequired to be debt-free. \u201cRather, all that is required is that an applicant act responsibly \ngiven his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \n\u2018concomitant conduct,\u2019 that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the \nplan.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017). See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n13-00987 at 3, n. 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 14, 2014). \nApplicant did not disclose any financial delinquencies on her December 2022 SCA, \nand in February 2023, she told the investigator that her finances were fine. Six months \nlater, she filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection with liabilities totaling almost $70,000. \nI am unable to find that there were conditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control which \ncontributed to her financial problems. There is no evidence that she has made any \npayments to the bankruptcy trustee. Although her filing for bankruptcy protection is a step \nin the right direction in getting her finances under control, Applicant should have taken \nthis action much sooner. There is no documented history of her making systematic \nmonthly payments to the trustee in accordance with her bankruptcy plan. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient information to mitigate the financial concerns in \nthis case. She did not provide any correspondence or payment arrangements with her \ncreditors. Overall, I find that Applicant has not demonstrated that she acted responsibly \nto address her financial delinquencies in a timely manner. She did not provide sufficient \nevidence to mitigate the financial considerations security concern. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAccess to classified and protected information requires faithful adherence to the \nrules and regulations governing such activity. A person who fails to address concerns, \neven after having been placed on notice that his or her access or security clearance is in \njeopardy, may lack the willingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal \ninterests are at stake. \nApplicant did not provide documentation of communications with any of her \ndelinquent creditors. She could have made more of an effort to have her increasing debt \nresolved by filing her Chapter 13 bankrupty petition earlier, and then she could have \nsubmitted documentation of the regular payments made to the bankruptcy trustee. \nApplicant only took action to file for bankruptcy protection after receipt of the SOR. \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more effort toward documented resolution of her delinquent debts, she may well be \nable to demonstrate persuasive evidence of her security clearance worthiness. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case, I conclude Applicant has not met her burden of \nproof and persuasion. At the present time, Applicant did not mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concerns or establish her eligibility for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e \u2013 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nApplicant did not mitigate the financial consideration concerns.

(GEs 2-4; Tr. 35) Applicant attributed his \ndebt delinquencies, in part, to his 2020  divorce and periods of unemployment. (Tr. 21-\n22) \nTo date, Applicant has not addressed any of the debts listed in the SOR with \ndocumented payments and payment plans. While several of the listed SOR debts have \nsince been removed from his credit report, he provided no explanations of their removal. \n(AE A) Although, removal of the debts likely contributed to his improved credit scores. \nThrough a credit repair firm he engaged in December 2023, he has continued to \ndispute the SOR debts in issue. (Tr. 28-35, 38-39) However, he has provided no \ndocumentation of his exchanges with his credit repair firm, or achieved results (if any), \nsave for the four unnamed debts removed from his credit report. (AE A) At this time, \nApplicant\u2019s listed SOR debts cannot be credited with any successful disputes. Based on \navailable evidence, his SOR-listed debts remain unresolved and outstanding. (GEs 2-4; \nTr. 26-29) \nApplicant reported no financial counseling. He currently earns $92,000 annually. \n(Tr. 26) After allowing for monthly expenses, he has an estimated monthly remainder of \napproximately $200. (Tr. 37) With his limited resources, he hopes to be able to set up \nmodest payment plans. (Tr. 38) So far, though, he has not set up any payment plans \nwith any of his creditors, and he has no current timetable for doing so. (Tr. 38) \nPolicies \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d \nExec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines.

These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. \nThese AGs include conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of the conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be considered before deciding \nwhether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, \nthe guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n  Financial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information.

These debt delinquencies warrant \nthe application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the financial consideration \nguidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations.\u201d Each of these DCs apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information.

See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nApplicant cited periods of unemployment as factors contributing to his past debt \ndelinquencies. Disputing all of the SOR-listed debts, he has retained a credit repair firm \nto dispute the debts. Whatever progress he has achieved in resolving his debt \ndelinquencies is not documented. Without evidence of the nature of his disputes with his \ncreditors and results achieved, no reasonable basis for disputing the debts can be \nassigned to Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts in issue. \nPartially applicable mitigating conditions (MC) is limited to \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions \nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss \nof employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency a death, divorce \nor separation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and \nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Because Applicant has not \ndocumented any actions taken to resolve his SOR-listed debts through payments and \npayment plans, he cannot satisfy the \u201cacted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d prong \nof \u00b6 20(b). \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of accrued debts. See ISCR Case No. 19-02593 at 4-5 (App. Bd. \nOct. 18, 2021); ISCR Case No. 19-01599 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2020). Without more \ninformation from Applicant, debts removed from his credit report, while likely factors in \nthe improvement of his credit scores, cannot be considered evidence of SOR debt \npayments, payment plans, or resolution by other good-faith means. \nWell-intentioned promises and intentions, while encouraging, cannot be \nsubstituted for a voluntary, good faith track record of payments. Based on the evidence \npresented, Applicant is not able to demonstrate a sufficient tangible payment history of \nactual debt reduction or documented reasonably mounted disputes to satisfy Appeal \nBoard guidance associated with the good-faith and responsible payment and dispute \nrequirements of MC \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), MC 20(d), and 20(e). \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his finances are fully compatible with minimum standards for \nholding a clearance.

Favorable resolution of Applicant\u2019s handling of his \ndebts cannot be made without a better track record of payment initiatives and \ndocumented good faith reasonable disputes of the debts he challenges. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person.

He made no payments on this \ndebt after it became delinquent. His plan was to dispute it or allow it to age off his credit \nreport. While this debt does not appear on his September 2024 credit report, there is \ninsufficient evidence in the record to determine the reason. He provided no \ndocumentation regarding this account or his resolution efforts. (Tr. 29-32, 52; Answer; GE \n1-3) \nThe automobile loan in SOR \u00b6 1.b for $5,864 is not resolved. Applicant opened \nthis account to purchase a truck in June or July 2016. The creditor repossessed the \nvehicle sometime in 2018. He fell behind on this account because he left a job that he \nstrongly disliked and had not yet found a new one. He made no payments on the account \nafter the vehicle was repossessed. He disputed the account with Equifax for reasons that \nare unclear. While this debt does not appear on his September 2024 credit report, there \nis insufficient evidence in the record to determine the reason.

(Tr. 37-38; Answer; GE 1-3) \nThe credit card in SOR \u00b6 1.d for $663 is not resolved. Applicant made no resolution \nefforts on this account. He disputed this account with Equifax, but he provided no basis \nfor his dispute. He provided no documentation regarding this account. (Tr. 39; Answer; \nGE 1-4) \nThe credit card in SOR \u00b6 1.e for $146 is not resolved. Applicant opened this \naccount in January 2021. The last payment he made on this account was in January \n2022. He has made no resolution efforts on this account since then. He believes this is a \nsecured credit card, so he does not understand how he owes money on it, but he did not \ncontact the creditor to try to clear up his confusion. He did not provide any documentary \nevidence regarding this account. (Tr. 39-41; Answer; GE 1-4) \nThe federal tax debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f for $5,532 is being resolved, however, the nature \nand extent of the resolution is unclear. This tax debt accrued in tax years (TY) 2014, 2016, \n2020, and 2021. Applicant claimed that, in April 2024, he hired a certified public \naccountant (CPA) who filed his federal income tax return for TY 2023, and that helped \n\u201calleviate\u201d some of his federal tax debt with an offset of his TY 2023 refund of about \n$1,000. He claimed that some of his payments, including a $351 payment they \u201ctook\u201d \nrecently are not appearing on the IRS website, so he needs to contact the IRS to clear up \nthis issue. He claimed that he contacted them about this issue once during the COVID-\n19 pandemic, but the IRS was short staffed, so he could not speak to anyone who could \nanswer his question. He also claimed that he contacted the IRS again in about March \n2023, and again could not speak to anyone there. Conversely, he testified that the IRS \nwebsite does reflect payments. The IRS website no longer shows a balance for 2014 and \nshows a reduced balance of $2,028 (down from $3,892) for TY 2016. He claimed that, on \nthe day of the hearing, the IRS website showed his total balance as $3,751. He testified, \n\u201cthey are taking money from me, so it is getting paid.\u201d He does not have a payment \narrangement with the IRS but claimed that he tried to make one and could not get through \nto anyone over the phone.

Applicant did not timely file his federal income tax return for TY 2017, \nbecause he believes it was lost in the mail. He also claimed that he had trouble obtaining \nhis W-2 form for that tax year. He claimed that he reached out to the IRS at some point \nabout his change of address, but so much time passed by that he \u201cjust gave up on it.\u201d He \nclaimed that the same thing happened with respect to his TY 2018 federal income tax \nreturn. He explained that he was going through a very rough time in life, was not making \nmuch money, and was more worried about where he would get his next meal. While it is \nnot alleged in the SOR, he also did not file his TY 2022 federal income tax return because \nhe had issues with TurboTax. He believes that he owes federal taxes for TY 2022.

He is unsure of his current budget \nbecause of a recent change in circumstances that has made it unnecessary to pay his \nsignificant rent payment. Sadly, his mother passed away within the last two weeks. She \nleft him her home and land where he will reside, saving him about $1,000 per month. \nWhereas he had about $500 in surplus at the end of each month, he anticipates having \nabout $1,500 in surplus at the end of each month. He has a monthly truck payment of \n$1,160 for a 2019 half-ton pickup truck that he purchased in 2022 for about $53,000. He \nbought the truck because he wanted it for a boat cleaning business he started. He has no \nmoney in savings. About a month before the hearing, he tried to enroll with a debt \nconsolidation company, but claimed the company told him he did not qualify. He assumes \nthat he did not qualify because of his credit. He attributes his financial issues to his divorce \nand a period of unemployment and underemployment from August 2018 until January \n2019. (Tr. 21-25, 28-29, 35-37, 50-52; GE 4) \nWhile they are not alleged in the SOR, Applicant has two furniture loans, a cable \naccount, and two credit cards on which he is currently delinquent. The furniture loans are \npast due in the amount of $643 and $1,385, with total loan balances of $3,463 and $8,277, \nrespectively. The cable account is in collections with a balance of $260. The two credit \ncards are past due in the amount of $168 and $271, with total balances of $826 and \n$4,253, respectively. Now that he has an extra $1,000 per month, he plans to contact his \ncreditors, settle these non-SOR accounts, and never borrow money again. (Tr. 25-28; GE \n4) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant had six delinquent debts totaling about $22,000. One of those debts is a \ndelinquent federal tax debt. He failed to file his federal income tax returns for TYs 2017 \nand 2018, as required. The above disqualifying conditions are established. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;   \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or \nher legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May \n16, 2018). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues are recent and ongoing. With the exception of some \noffsets to the IRS, he has not provided sufficient evidence that he has resolved or is \nresolving his SOR debts or his income tax filing deficiencies. On the contrary, he failed to \ntimely file his federal income tax return for TY 2022, and he believes that he will owe \nadditional federal taxes if and when he does file that return. Although he has reduced the \nbalance of his federal tax debt, he does not have a current payment arrangement with the \nIRS. He also has additional delinquent debts that were not included in the SOR. He has \nnot established a track record of financial responsibility. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(g) do not \napply. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies were caused by a divorce and unemployment or \nunderemployment. The immediate cause of the unemployment and underemployment \nwas that he quit a job in 2018. These causes are both beyond and within his control. \nRegardless, the lack of evidence of the resolution of his SOR debts, his lack of compliance \nwith tax requirements, and his plan to let some of the SOR debts age off his credit report \nmeans that AG \u00b6 20(b) and AG \u00b6 20(d) do not apply. \nApplicant claims that several of the SOR debts are time-barred by the applicable \nSOL. This could be a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of a debt. However, he \ndid not provide documented proof of information such as debt accrual dates that would \nsubstantiate such a claim. He also disputed debts for undisclosed reasons, or because \nhe thought his ex-wife should be responsible for some of the debt. His failure to provide \na reason for a dispute means he did not provide a reasonable basis for it. When he \nclaimed his ex-wife should be responsible for certain debts, he did not provide any \ndocuments to show that he is not jointly and severally liable for said debts. AG \u00b6 20(e) \ndoes not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis and have considered \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nApplicant\u2019s military service.

(HE 2) \nOn December 4, 2023, Applicant provided a response to the SOR, and Department \nCounsel requested a hearing. (HE 3) On January 26, 2024, Department Counsel was \nready to proceed. On February 6, 2024, the case was assigned to me. On February 12, \n2024, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice scheduling \nthe hearing for March 26, 2024. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled. \nDepartment Counsel provided two exhibits, and Applicant did not provide any \nexhibits. (Transcript (Tr.) 11-12, 19; Government Exhibits (GE) 1-GE 2) There were no \nobjections, and all exhibits were admitted into evidence. (Tr. 19) The transcript was \nreceived on April 6, 2024. \nLegal Issue \nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice concerning Lebanon. (Tr. 19; \nHE 5) Applicant did not object, and I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion. (Tr. 19-20) \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative \nproceedings. See ISCR Case No. 16-02522 at 2-3 (App. Bd. July 12, 2017); ISCR Case \nNo. 05-11292 at 4 n. 1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. \nOct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004) and McLeod \nv. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n. 4 (3d Cir. 1986)). Usually, \nadministrative notice at ISCR proceedings is accorded to facts that are either well known \nor from government reports. See Stein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. \n2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice).  \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits and transcript. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c through 1.i, and 1.k \nwith clarifications. (HE 3) He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.j. (Id.) He also provided mitigating \ninformation.

(Tr. \n24-25) His bank account is with a U.S. bank. His two children live with Applicant in the \nSouthwest Asian country, and his children are U.S. citizens. (Tr. 25) \nIn the previous seven years, Applicant stayed in Lebanon on 22 occasions and \nvisited family and friends. (GE 10) On his most recent trip, Applicant, his spouse, and two \nchildren stayed for 20 days in Lebanon in August 2023. (Tr. 27) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant\u2019s mother, spouse, sister, and brother are citizens and \nresidents of Lebanon. Applicant\u2019s spouse lives with him in the Southwest Asian country. \n(Tr. 25) In December 2023, she received her permanent U.S. Visa or \u201cgreen card.\u201d (Tr. \n26) She intends to apply for U.S. citizenship as soon as she is eligible.

(Tr. 37) He speaks to his parents-in-law about every three months. \n(Tr. 37) Applicant and his spouse do not provide financial support to his parents-in-law. \n(Tr. 37) He does not maintain continuing contact with the other 55 persons cited in SOR \n\u00b6 1.c. (Tr. 38-39) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e allege Applicant\u2019s cousin and friend are citizens of a Western \nEuropean country and residents of Southwest Asian countries. His cousin works in the \nsame country as Applicant, and they have monthly contacts. (Tr. 40-41) The friend is his \nspouse\u2019s friend. (Tr. 41) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g allege two of Applicant\u2019s cousins are citizens of Lebanon and \none is an enlisted soldier and the other is a police officer in Lebanon. He communicates \nwith the enlisted soldier about once a year. (Tr. 44) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleges seven of Applicant\u2019s relatives are citizens and residents of \nLebanon and work for an international organization. Applicant admitted the allegation.

(Tr. 40) \nApplicant would love to return to his work for the Defense contractor or the U.S. \nGovernment. (Tr. 58) He said: \nI became [a] U.S. citizen in 2014. I pledged allegiance under oath to the \nU.S. when I became a citizen in 2014. But I really felt like an American as \nsoon as I moved to the U.S. in 2004 and I got assimilated into the U.S. \nculture, the people. I moved to the U.S. when I was 16, and I moved out, or \nmoved away 10, 11, years later. \nThese are the years that I felt like, you know, I became a man, I became \nwho I am today.

(Tr. 57) \nLebanon \nLebanon is a parliamentary republic based on the 1943 National Pact, which \napportions governmental authority among a Maronite Christian president, a Shia speaker \nof the Chamber of Deputies (parliament), and a Sunni prime minister. On May 15, 2022, \nthe government conducted parliamentary elections that international observers \nconsidered free and fair. \nThe U.S. Department of State has issued a Level 3, Reconsider Travel advisory \nfor Lebanon due to crime, terrorism, armed conflict, civil unrest, kidnapping and the U.S. \nEmbassy has a limited capacity to provide support to U.S. citizens. Some areas have \nincreased risk. The Department of State has issued notices not to travel for the following \nareas in Lebanon: to the border with Syria due to terrorism and armed conflict; to the \nborder with Israel due to the potential for armed conflict; or to refugee settlements due to \nthe potential for armed clashes. \nLocal security authorities in Lebanon have noted a rise in violent crimes, including \npolitical violence. Multiple unsolved killings in Lebanon may have been politically \nmotivated. Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Lebanon. Terrorists may \nconduct attacks with little or no warning targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, \nmarkets/shopping malls, and local government facilities. Kidnapping, whether for ransom, \npolitical motives, or family disputes, has occurred in Lebanon. Suspects in kidnappings \nmay have ties to terrorist or criminal organizations. \nThere is potential for death or injury in Lebanon because of terrorist attacks. Violent \nextremist groups, including U.S. government-designated terrorist organizations, operate \nin Lebanon. ISIS and Al-Nusrah Front have claimed responsibility for suicide bombings \nin Lebanon. U.S. citizens have been the targets of terrorist attacks in Lebanon. The threat \nof anti-Western terrorist activity persists, as does the risk of death or injury to non-targeted \nbystanders. Clashes between Lebanese authorities and criminal elements continue to \noccur in areas of the Bekaa Valley and border regions. Hizballah maintains a strong \npresence in the Bekaa Valley, in addition to areas in southern Lebanon and south Beirut. \nHizballah has been the target of attacks by other extremist groups for their support of the \nAssad regime in Syria. \nTerrorist groups operating in Lebanon include U.S. government-designated foreign \nterrorist organizations such as Hizballah and ISIS. Hizballah continued armed militia \nactivities in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen in collaboration with the Iranian regime. Lebanon\u2019s \nPalestinian refugee camps remained largely outside the control of Lebanese security \nforces and posed a security threat because of the potential for militant recruitment and \nterrorist infiltration. Several individuals on the FBI\u2019s most wanted list and the Department \nof State's Rewards for Justice list reportedly remained in Lebanon. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIran continues to provide Hizballah with most of its funding, training, weapons, and \nexplosives, as well as political, diplomatic, monetary, and organizational aid. Iran\u2019s annual \nfinancial backing to Hizballah - which has been estimated to be hundreds of millions of \ndollars annually-accounts for the overwhelming majority of the group\u2019s annual budget. \nThis support has made Hizballah a dangerous terrorist partner with Iran and the most-\ncapable terrorist organization in Lebanon. The Assad regime in Syria has provided \ntraining, weapons, and diplomatic and political support to Hizballah. Hizballah also \nreceives funding in the form of private donations from some Lebanese Shia diaspora \ncommunities worldwide, including profits from legal and illegal businesses. These include \nsmuggling contraband goods, passport falsification, narcotics trafficking, money \nlaundering, and credit card, immigration, and bank fraud. \nIn its 2023 Annual Threat Assessment, the Office of the Director of National \nIntelligence assessed that Iran and Lebanese Hizballah remain committed to conducting \nterrorist attacks and could seek to do so on U.S. soil. While ISIS and al-Qa\u2019ida suffered \nmajor leadership losses in 2022, degrading external operations and capabilities, both \norganizations\u2019 offshoots continue to exploit local conflicts and broader political instability \nto make territorial and operational gains. Lebanese Hizballah will continue to develop its \nglobal terrorist capabilities as a complement to the group\u2019s growing conventional military \ncapabilities in the region. \nHizballah seeks to reduce U.S. influence in Lebanon and the broader Middle East. \nHizballah maintains the capability to target U.S. persons and interests in the region, \nworldwide, and, to a lesser extent, in the United States. Iran could benefit strategically if \nHizballah were to conduct terrorist activity on U.S. soil. The U.S. Department of the \nTreasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has imposed sanctions against \nmultiple people and entities connected to Hizballah. The U.S. Department of Justice has \nprosecuted individuals connected to Hizballah for espionage, terrorism, and export \nviolations. Significant human rights violations continue to occur in Lebanon. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person.

An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nForeign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d stating: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 lists conditions that could raise a foreign influence security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;   \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, sister, and brother are citizens and residents of Lebanon. \nApplicant\u2019s spouse is a citizen of Lebanon, and she lives with him in a Southwest Asian \ncountry. In December 2023, his spouse received a permanent U.S. Visa or \u201cgreen card.\u201d \nShe intends to apply for U.S. citizenship as soon as she is eligible. He talks to his mother \nat least once a week, and he communicates with his brother and sister \u201cevery couple of \nmonths,\u201d and when he goes to Lebanon, he visits them. \nApplicant lives with his spouse, and she communicates with her parents about \nonce a week. They live in the same area of Lebanon as Applicant\u2019s mother, brother, and \nsister. He speaks to his parents-in-law about every three months. Applicant and his \nspouse own properties in Lebanon valued at about $145,000. Applicant is making \ninstallment payments on one property. \nThe mere possession of close family ties with people living in a foreign country is \nnot, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an applicant, his or \nher spouse, or someone sharing living quarters with them, has such a relationship with \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \neven one person living in a foreign country, this factor alone is sufficient to create the \npotential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 08-02864 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2009) (discussing \nproblematic visits of that applicant\u2019s father to Iran). \nIn ISCR Case No. 17-01979 at 5 (App. Bd. July 31, 2019) the Appeal Board \nreversed the grant of a security clearance and noted, \u201cApplication of the guidelines is not \na comment on an applicant\u2019s patriotism but merely an acknowledgment that people may \nact in unpredictable ways when faced with choices that could be important to a loved-\none, such as a family member.\u201d \nNot every foreign contact or tie presents the heightened risk under AG \u00b6 7(a). The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \nmember living under a foreign government. The nature and strength of the ties and the \ncountry involved (i.e., the nature of its government, its relationship with the United States, \nand its human rights record) are relevant in assessing whether there is a likelihood of \nvulnerability to coercion. \u201c[T]he nature of the foreign government involved, and the \nintelligence-gathering history of that government are among the important considerations \nthat provide context for the other record evidence and must be brought to bear on the \nJudge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case. The country\u2019s human rights record is another \nimportant consideration.\u201d ISCR Case No. 16-02435 at 3 (App. Bd. May 15, 2018) (citing \nISCR Case No. 15-00528 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 13, 2017)). Another important consideration \nis the nature of a nation\u2019s government\u2019s relationship with the United States. These factors \nare relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members or friends living \nin that country are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement.  \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, the government ignores the rule of law including \nwidely accepted civil liberties, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, the government is engaged in a counterinsurgency, terrorism causes a \nsubstantial amount of death or property damage, or the country is known to conduct \nintelligence collection operations against the United States. The relationship of Lebanon \nwith the United States and the situations involving terrorists and insurgents in that country \nplaces a significant burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his \nrelationships with anyone living in that country does not pose a security risk because of \nthe risks due to terrorist activities in that country. Applicant should not be placed into a \nposition where he might be forced to choose between the protection of classified \ninformation and concerns about assisting someone living in Lebanon. \nThe issue under Guideline B is whether Applicant has ties or contacts with friends \nor associates in Lebanon, which raise security concerns because those ties and contacts \ncreate a potential vulnerability that criminals, or terrorists could seek to exploit in an effort \nto get unauthorized access to U.S. classified information that he has by virtue of a security \nclearance. Applicant may be vulnerable to influence or pressure exerted on, or through, \nhis family. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInternational terrorist groups are known to conduct intelligence activities as \neffectively as capable state intelligence services, and Lebanon has a significant problem \nwith terrorism and crime. Applicant\u2019s family living in Lebanon \u201ccould be a means through \nwhich Applicant comes to the attention of those who seek U.S. information or technology \nand who would attempt to exert coercion upon him.\u201d ADP Case No. 14-01655 at 3 (App. \nBd. Dec. 9, 2015) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-02950 at 3 (App. Bd. May 14, 2015)). \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with family living in Lebanon create a potential conflict of \ninterest because terrorists could place pressure on them to attempt to cause Applicant to \ncompromise classified information. Those relationships create \u201ca heightened risk of \nforeign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d under AG \u00b6 7. Department \nCounsel produced substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s relationships with family living in \nLebanon. Department Counsel also produced evidence of the bombings and other \nterrorist activity in Lebanon. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), 7(e), and 7(f) apply, and further inquiry is \nnecessary about potential application of any mitigating conditions. \nAG \u00b6 8 lists conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent \nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation; \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAs indicated in the disqualifying conditions of the Foreign Influence section, supra, \nApplicant has relationships with family living in Lebanon. He also owns property in \nLebanon. These issues increase the risk that family in Lebanon could be targeted to put \npressure on Applicant to provide classified information. \nThe Appeal Board has concluded that contact every two months or three months \nconstitutes \u201cfrequent contact\u201d under AG \u00b6\u00b6 7 and 8. ISCR Case No. 14-05986 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Oct. 14, 2016). See also ISCR Case No. 04-09541 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) \n(finding contacts with applicant\u2019s siblings once every four or five months not casual and \ninfrequent and stating \u201cThe frequency with which Applicant speaks to his family members \nin Iran does not diminish the strength of his family ties.\u201d). Frequency of contact is not the \nsole determinant of foreign interest security concerns. \nApplicant\u2019s SOR does not allege that he visited Lebanon 22 times from December \n2014 to present, and that his spouse has frequent contacts with her parents who are \ncitizens and residents of Lebanon. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, \n2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR \nmay be considered, stating: \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation;  \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3. \nId.

The non-SOR information discussed \nabove will not be considered except for the five purposes listed above. \nA key factor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d His relationship with the United States must be \nweighed against the potential conflict of interest created by his connections to Lebanon. \nApplicant was born in Lebanon, and he moved to the United States when he was 16 years \nold. In 2014, he was naturalized as a U.S. citizen. He was educated in the United States, \nand he resided in the United States for 10 years. His spouse intends to become a U.S. \ncitizen. His two children are U.S. citizens. He has worked for the same Defense contractor \nfor about seven years. \nThese factors are balanced against the security concerns outlined in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s access to classified information could add risk to his family in Lebanon. There \nis no allegation that he would choose to help the terrorists against the interests of the \nUnited States. A Guideline B adjudication is not a judgment on an applicant\u2019s character \nor loyalty to the United States. It is a determination as to whether an applicant\u2019s \ncircumstances foreseeably present a security risk. See ISCR Case No. 19-00831 at 5 \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(App. Bd. July 29, 2020). The concern here pertains to the risk to his family living in \nLebanon and how that risk could be used to coerce Applicant. It does not relate to his \nloyalty or patriotism to the United States. \nApplicant has not rebutted the concern arising from his relationships with family in \nLebanon. His travels to Lebanon are also a factor indicating his care and concern for \ncitizens and residents of Lebanon and his affection for them. His connections to the United \nStates, taken together, are insufficient to overcome the foreign influence security \nconcerns under Guideline B. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline B are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is 36 years old, and he is seeking to resume his employment with a \nDefense contractor. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree in international relations, and a master\u2019s \ndegree in engineering management. In 2018, he married, and his two children are ages \none and four. He has worked for the same Defense contractor for about seven years. \nApplicant has important connections to the United States as discussed under \nGuideline B. His U.S. citizenship, his children\u2019s U.S. citizenship, his spouse\u2019s intention to \napply for U.S. citizenship, and his contributions to DOD are some of his most important \nconnections to the United States. He made a credible and sincere statement about his \nstrong commitment to the United States. \nThe reasons for denying Applicant\u2019s security clearance are more persuasive. A \nGuideline B decision concerning Lebanon must take into consideration the geopolitical \nsituation and dangers in that country. See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd.

Terrorists continue to threaten the interests of the \nUnited States, and those who cooperate and assist the United States. \nAside from his contacts with close relatives (his parents and siblings) and his \nspouse\u2019s contacts with close relatives (her parents), the other contacts with relatives and \nfriends in Lebanon are mitigated because they are relatively infrequent and unlikely to \nresult in a risk of coercion from nefarious entities in Lebanon.  \nApplicant visited Lebanon 22 times from December 2014 to present. He has \nfrequent contacts with his mother and siblings who are citizens and residents of Lebanon. \nHis spouse has frequent contacts with her parents. Concern for and loyalty to family living \nin Lebanon is a positive character trait. However, Applicant did not meet his burden of \nshowing that he was unlikely to come to the attention of those interested in acquiring U.S. \nclassified information. \u201cApplication of the guidelines is not a comment on an applicant\u2019s \npatriotism but merely an acknowledgment that people may act in unpredictable ways \nwhen faced with choices that could be important\u201d to a family member. See Generally \nISCR Case No. 17-01979 at 5 (App. Bd. July 31, 2019). \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, \nExec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the \nfacts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Applicant failed to mitigate \nforeign influence security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d through 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j and 1.k: \nFor Applicant \n13 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n14 \n",

On October 3, 2024, I proposed to the parties that this case was appropriate \nfor a summary disposition in Applicant\u2019s favor. Department Counsel did not object. \nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for \nher current employer since 2020. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2009. She is \ndivorced with two adult children. \nApplicant has a history of mental health issues and alcohol problems.

She was evaluated at the DoD\u2019s request by a \nlicensed psychologist and diagnosed with alcohol use disorder, mild, in sustained \nremission. \nIt took time, but Applicant came to realize that she has an alcohol addiction. She \nhas benefitted from treatment and therapy. She has been sober since October 2022 \nand plans to stay that way for the rest of her life. She continues to attend therapy. \nThe disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), 22(c), 22(d), 28(a), 28(b), and \n28(c) have been raised by the evidence. However, I find evidence of successful \nrehabilitation, and that Applicant has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of \nabstinence. Her alcohol problems and mental health conditions are under control and \nhave a low probability of recurrence or exacerbation; she no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and there is no indication of a current problem. The mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a), 23(b), 29(a), and 29(e) are applicable. \nThe concerns over Applicant\u2019s alcohol abuse and mental health issues do not \ncreate doubt about her current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to \nprotect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a \nwhole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence. I \nalso gave due consideration to the whole-person concept. Accordingly, I conclude that \nshe met her ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information.

His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 47 years old. He immigrated to the United States from the DRC in 2009 and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2015. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in the DRC and an associate degree and another bachelor\u2019s degree in the United States. He married in 2016.

In Applicant\u2019s August 2022 security clearance application (SCA), he disclosed he has two children ages 10 and 7. In his August 2023 interrogatories he again lists them as his children.

His younger child is a citizen and resident of the United States. He did not elaborate on why he listed his niece as his child or whether he acts in a parental role regarding her care. Because he listed her on his SCA and has referred to her as his child, he likely has a close relationship with her.

Applicant did not provide \na response to the FORM; did not object to the Government\u2019s evidence; and did not submit \ndocuments. The Government\u2019s evidence is admitted. The case was assigned to me on \nApril 1, 2024. \nAdministrative Matters \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) (Administrative Notice Exhibits I \nthough VII). Without objection, I have taken administrative notice of the facts contained in \nthe request. The facts are summarized in the written request and will not be repeated \nverbatim in this decision. \nOf particular note, are U.S. Department of State travel advisories to not travel or \nreconsider travel to certain areas of the DRC due to terrorism, crime, civil unrest, armed \nconflict, murder, rape, kidnapping and pillaging. There is a threat to humanitarian aid \nworkers and other personnel. Terrorists and armed groups have attacked military and \ncivilian targets. Terrorist groups are intent on attacking U.S. citizens. The DRC\u2019s instability \ncontinues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the United States. The Islamic \nState of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) maintains links with local affiliates in the DRC. ISIS is \ndesignated as a foreign terrorist organization. ISIS has conducted a series of attacks in \nthe DRC that killed, injured, or abducted thousands of people. There are significant \nhuman rights issues in the DRC which include unlawful and arbitrary killings, extrajudicial \nkillings, arbitrary arrest or detention, political prisoners or detainees, serious problems \nwith the independence of the judiciary, and punishment of family members for alleged \noffenses by a relative, along with many other abuses. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.a through 2.e. He denied \nSOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of \nfact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 47 years old. He immigrated to the United States from the DRC in \n2009 and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2015. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in \nthe DRC and an associate degree and another bachelor\u2019s degree in the United States. \nHe married in 2016. His wife was a citizen of the DRC and became a permanent resident \nof the United States. In April 2023 she became a naturalized citizen. Applicant has worked \nfor a federal contractor since June 2022. \nIn Applicant\u2019s August 2022 security clearance application (SCA), he disclosed he \nhas two children ages 10 and 7.

Because he listed \nher on his SCA and has referred to her as his child, he likely has a close relationship with \nher. In his background interview from October 2022, he stated he provided her financial \nsupport. (Item 4, 6) \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a citizen of the DRC and a permanent resident of the United \nStates. She lives with Applicant in the United States. His father-in-law is a citizen and \nresident of the DRC. Applicant has eight siblings who are citizens and residents of the \nDRC. He provided a sister a total of about $5,000 in support in the past. He said his gifts \nwere \u201cfrom time to time.\u201d He indicated in his background interview that he provided his \nsister support for the benefit of his child or niece in the DRC. (Items 4, 6) \nApplicant completed government interrogatories in April and August 2023. He \naffirmed that the information included in his summary of personal interviews was accurate \nand correct except for a spelling correction, his new address, an update of his wife\u2019s \ncitizenship status, and an update on the number of collections accounts he had and \ndisputed. (Items 5, 6) \nDuring his October 2022 interview with a government investigator, Applicant \ncorrected previous information provided and advised he had worked for the DRC Health \nDepartment for one year. He said he was not involved in intelligence activity. He disclosed \nthat he was unaware what one of his brothers\u2019 occupation was. Another brother is a police \nofficer. His sisters are employed as a secretary and seamstress, and one is unemployed. \nHis other brothers are an architect, a lawyer, and an IT professional. His father-in-law is \nunemployed, and Applicant did not know what his former occupation was. Applicant \nmaintains monthly telephonic contact with two sisters and five brothers. He maintains \nquarterly telephonic contact with one brother. He did not provide any other information \nabout his siblings. He notes on his SCA regarding his siblings that he does not know who \ntheir current employers are but then also says they are not affiliated with the DRC \ngovernment, military, defense industry, foreign movement, or intelligence service. (Item \n4, 6) \nApplicant loaned a cousin, who is a citizen and resident of DRC, $20,000 to start \nan IT training center in the DRC. It did not work out and the cousin returned the money to \nApplicant. (Item 4, 6) \nApplicant disclosed in his SCA that he traveled to China for 11-20 days from March \nto April 2018 for tourism. He traveled to the DRC between June 2018 and March 2019 for \nmore than 30 days to visit family and friends. He traveled again in October 2021 for 21-\n30 days to the DRC to visit family and friends. (Item 4) \nThe SOR alleges three delinquent debts totaling approximately $30,614. Applicant \ndid not disclose any delinquent debts on his August 2022 SCA.

In his \nApril 2023 response to interrogatories, he stated the debt was not paid and he was \ndisputing it. He did not indicate the basis of his dispute. In a letter submitted on August 4, \n2023, to Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, he provided an update about his \naccounts and said several had been closed and others were being disputed. Regarding \nthe loan in SOR \u00b6 1.a, he stated, \u201c$24,000 owed, still dispute due Statute of Limitations.\u201d \nIn his August 2023 response to interrogatories, he stated he was disputing two debts, \npresumably this was one of them. In his SOR answer, he stated this account was still in \ndispute and the original creditor no longer held the account. He said the collection agency \nalso did not hold the account. He said he was advised by his financial agency that the \naccount would be removed from his credit report. He expected it to be closed at the \nconclusion of the dispute. Applicant did not provide evidence as to what the specifics of \nhis dispute entail and whether he made any payments towards the debt. This debt is \nunresolved. (Items 2,5, 7) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($4,199) and 1.c ($2,271) are judgments filed against Applicant in \nDecember 2020 and January 2021, respectively for credit card debts. After receipt of the \nSOR, Applicant settled the judgments for less than the full amount for both debts. (Items \n2, 8, 9, 10, 11) \nThe SOR allegations are supported by Applicant\u2019s admissions in his SCA, answer \nto the SOR, statements in his interrogatories, court documents, and credit reports from \nMay 2023 and December 2023. Any derogatory information that was not alleged in the \nSOR will not be considered for disqualifying purposes but may be considered in the \napplication of mitigating conditions and in my whole-person analysis. (Items 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, \n9, 10, 11) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe SOR alleged three delinquent debts totaling approximately $30,614. There is \nsufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant attributed his financial difficulties to his wife\u2019s health in 2019, \nunemployment due to the pandemic, and underemployment. These conditions were \nbeyond his control. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. Two of the debts alleged had judgments entered \nagainst him in 2020 and 2021. He traveled to the DRC between June 2018 to March 2019 \nfor more than 30 days to visit family and friends. He traveled again in October 2021 for \n21-30 days to the DRC to visit family and friends. He did not settle these judgments until \nafter he received the SOR. He obviously prioritized his trips before paying his delinquent \ndebts. He admitted that the third and largest debt was for a loan that he used to pay his \nexpenses, which he did not pay, and now disputes. It appears he is waiting for the statute \nof limitations to run on the debt and then it will be removed from his credit report. Although \nthis may be a legitimate legal action, it does not constitute acting responsibly towards a \nlegitimate loan he failed to repay or constitute a legitimate dispute. This debt is \nunresolved. AG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nApplicant has not resolved his largest debt. His financial problems are ongoing and \nrecent. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. It appears Applicant has worked with a DCC and has \nresolved other debts and settled the two judgments in the SOR. It is unclear if he received \nfinancial counseling through the DCC. AG \u00b6 20(c) has minimal application because there \nare not clear indications that he is resolving his largest debt. \nApplicant settled two of the SOR debts after judgments were entered against him \nand after his receipt of the SOR. Although they are now resolved, his actions do not \nconstitute a good-faith effort to repay his creditors. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nThere is a significant threat of terrorism and ongoing human rights problems in the \nDRC. I considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to the DRC. The nature of a nation\u2019s \ngovernment, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of \nterrorism. \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a citizen of the DRC and a permanent resident of the United \nStates. It is unknown if she visits the DRC and her family there. Applicant has a child or \nniece who resides in the DRC. He has eight siblings and his father-in-law who are \nresidents and citizens of the DRC. One brother is a police officer. He maintains regular \ncontact with his family in the DRC. He has taken trips, as recently as 2021 and 2018 for \nextended periods to the DRC to visit family and friends. Because of the DRC\u2019s threat of \nterrorism and human rights issues, there is a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \nmanipulation, inducement, pressure, and coercion. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b) and 7(e) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following is potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign person, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nApplicant has strong family ties to the DRC, including a child or niece who is a \nresident and eight siblings and his father-in-law, who are citizens and residents. He \ntravels to the DRC to visit family and friends. He maintains regular contact with these \nrelatives. He provides some financial support. He provided very limited information about \nhis relationships with his family in the DRC. Because Applicant requested a determination \non the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to question him about his foreign \ncontacts, where they live in the DRC, who they are employed by, and more specifics \nabout potential foreign influences. I was unable to evaluate his credibility and sincerity \nbased on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). \nI cannot find that Applicant\u2019s contact and communication with his relatives in the \nDRC is casual or infrequent. He maintains regular contact with his family in the DRC. AG \n\u00b6 8(c) does not apply. The evidence is insufficient for me to make a determination that his \nrelationships are such that it is unlikely Applicant would be placed in a position of having \nto choose between the foreign individuals and the interests of the United States. The fact \nhe has a child or niece living there would make it very difficult to make such a choice. \nThere is insufficient evidence to conclude that there is no conflict of interest because \nApplicant\u2019s sense of loyalty toward his relatives in the DRC is minimal or he has such \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States that he can be expected to \nresolve any conflict in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and B in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised under Guideline F, financial considerations, and Guideline B, foreign \ninfluence. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n10 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted both allegations without explanation. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 35 years old. After serving honorably in the U.S. Navy from November 2008 until August 2014, he was hired by a federal contractor immediately after leaving active duty. He worked for four years in state C before moving in 2018 to state Z to take his current position. He earned his high school diploma in June 2008. He married in May 2008 and has two school-age children. (Item 5 at 10-16,19, 22.) The SOR alleges two delinquent debts totaling $33,912. The debts are reflected in two credit reports, from January 2023 (Item 7 at 2) and July 2021 (Item 8 at 4-5). SOR \u00b6 1.a: car loan charged off in the amount of $18,147. Applicant admits the debt. He states he could not afford the car on a single income. The loan amount was for $46,883. (Item 7 at 2.) He turned over the vehicle after about 18 months when he could not afford to make the payments. He was not aware of the outstanding balance until confronted during his December 2021 security clearance interview. (Item 7 at 2; Item 8 at 4; Item 9 at 2-3.)

The case was assigned to me on January 3, 2024.  \nThe SOR and the Answer are the pleadings in the case. FORM Items 5 through 9 \nare admitted into evidence without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted both allegations without explanation. His admissions are \nincorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings \nand exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 35 years old. After serving honorably in the U.S. Navy from November \n2008 until August 2014, he was hired by a federal contractor immediately after leaving \nactive duty. He worked for four years in state C before moving in 2018 to state Z to take \nhis current position. He earned his high school diploma in June 2008. He married in May \n2008 and has two school-age children. (Item 5 at 10-16,19, 22.) \nThe SOR alleges two delinquent debts totaling $33,912. The debts are reflected in \ntwo credit reports, from January 2023 (Item 7 at 2) and July 2021 (Item 8 at 4-5). \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: car loan charged off in the amount of $18,147. Applicant admits the \ndebt. He states he could not afford the car on a single income. The loan amount was for \n$46,883. (Item 7 at 2.) He turned over the vehicle after about 18 months when he could \nnot afford to make the payments. He was not aware of the outstanding balance until \nconfronted during his December 2021 security clearance interview. (Item 7 at 2; Item 8 at \n4; Item 9 at 2-3.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: A timeshare account that is past due in the approximate amount of \n$1,981, which is in foreclosure status with a total loan balance of $15,765. Applicant \nadmits the debt. He was not aware of its status until confronted during his security \nclearance interview. (Item 9 at 2-3.) He told the investigator that he and his wife signed a \ntimeshare contract while on vacation. He sought to terminate the contract after returning \nfrom the vacation and was told he was not allowed to cancel the contract. He elected to \nnot make any payments. (Item 9 at 2-3.) Both credit reports show the account opened in \nMarch 2018 and reported delinquent in April 2019. (Item 7 at 2; Item 8 at 5.) \nIn response to government interrogatories, in the personal financial statement \nportion, Applicant did not list any details concerning his monthly income and provided one \nitem in his monthly expenses (utilities). He did list four debts and their monthly payments, \nwhich total $2,450. (Item 6 at 6.) During his security clearance interview he did offer that \nhe would contact the creditors to work out a payment plan.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \nApplicant accrued delinquent debts. His admissions and the evidence in the FORM \nestablish two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy \ndebts; and AG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are ongoing and \nunresolved. He was employed immediately after leaving active duty in 2014. He offered \nno evidence for consideration in deciding whether his overall reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment should mitigate these financial problems. \nApplicant attributes his debts to having a single income. The first prong of AG \u00b6 \n20(b) therefore applies. For full consideration under AG \u00b6 20(b), however, Applicant must \nestablish that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. He has not done so. He \ncompleted his SCA in July 2018 and was interviewed in December 2021. The most recent \nrecord evidence (January 2023 credit report) shows no actions. An applicant who waits \nuntil his clearance is in jeopardy before resolving debts may be lacking in the judgment \nexpected of those with access to classified information. See ISCR Case No. 16-01211 \n(App. Bd. May 30, 2018) citing ISCR Case No. 15-03208 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, 2017). He \ndid not provide any evidence that he acted responsibly under the circumstances to \nresolve them. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Because Applicant requested a determination \non the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his credibility and \nsincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, \n2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant a security clearance.

The SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines C (Foreign\nPreference) and B (Foreign Influence). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an\nAdministrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or\nrevoked.\nIn a sworn written statement, dated May 22, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR and\nrequested a hearing. By letter dated August 23, 2006, he elected to have his case decided on the\nwritten record, in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the government\u2019s File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM) dated March 1, 2007.  Applicant received the FORM on March 22, 2007, and was\n1\ngiven an opportunity to file objections and submit materials in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.\nApplicant submitted a written response on March 29, 2007.

Since 1972, his father has held a top secret clearance.\nHis family maintains close contact with the local U.S. military community, and participates in\nvarious U.S. forces organized leisure activities. Applicant has a Status of Forces certification. He has\nbeen trained and reports contact to U.S. military and civilian agencies, and keeps his security\nmanager up to date on all foreign contacts and travels.\nWhen Applicant completed his security application in 1998, he reported his status as a\nmilitary dependent. He also registered for Selective Service in the U.S. military. He listed his travels\nto Denmark and within Europe. He reported his university friends.\nApplicant is a U.S. citizen who possesses dual citizenship with Denmark. He received a\nDanish passport shortly after his birth in 1979. He renewed his Danish passport on October 17, 2001,\njust before his 21  birthday despite possessing a valid U.S. passport. Applicant sometimes used his\nst\nDanish passport over the years to travel within Europe. His Danish passport was valid until October\n17, 2011. In 2005, Applicant sought permission from the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense\nto maintain his Danish passport. However, he surrendered it to the Danish Consulate on September\n26, 2006.5\nIn 2002, the Defense Security Service investigated and interviewed Applicant during his\nsecurity clearance process. He stated he would be willing to renounce his Danish citizenship in order\nto obtain a security clearance.6\nIn 2003-2004, Applicant attended a university in California and received a Master\u2019s degree\nin electrical engineering. In 2004, he also completed a course in the U.S., and received a technical\ncertification.7\nApplicant works for an international business and therefore, has contact with foreign persons.\nHe has university friends and a girlfriend. He listed them on his application and later supporting\nnotarized statements in response to the SOR and the FORM.\nDepartment Counsel did not provide any information on Denmark for the record. I take\nadministrative notice of the following facts.\n\nConsular Information Sheet (Denmark), February 15, 2007.\n8\nDepartment of State: Note, Denmark (2007).\n9\nDepartment of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 517 (1988).\n10\n4\nDenmark and the United States have been close allies and friends for many years. Although\nDenmark is a constitutional monarchy, under its parliamentary form of government, its citizens enjoy\nthe same freedoms as citizens of the United States. Denmark does not illegally detain individuals,\nnor deny them a right to a fair trial. No human rights violations are known to exist. Denmark\nmaintains good relationships with the United States in many areas of similar concerns.  Relations\n8\nbetween the U.S. and Denmark are active and cordial. Denmark and the United States share common\nvalues and have parallel policies on most political, economic, and security issues.  \n9\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive, Adjudicative Guidelines For Determining Eligibility For Access\nTo Classified Information, sets forth the criteria which must be applied when determining security\nclearance eligibility. The adjudicative guidelines specifically distinguish between those factors that\nare considered in denying or revoking an employee\u2019s request for access to classified information\n(Disqualifying Conditions), and those factors that are considered in granting an employee\u2019s request\nfor access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions). By acknowledging that individual\ncircumstances of each case are always different, the guidelines provide substantive standards to assist\nan administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.\nThe adjudicative process requires thorough consideration and review of all available, reliable\ninformation about the applicant, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, to arrive at meritorious\ndecisions. Section E2.2 of Enclosure 2 of the Directive describes the essence of scrutinizing all\nappropriate variables in a case as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d In evaluating the conduct of the\napplicant and the circumstances in any case, the factors an administrative judge should consider\npursuant to the concept are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of the participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nProtecting national security is the paramount concern in reaching a decision in any case, and\nis dependent upon the primary standard that issuance of a clearance must be clearly consistent with\nthe interest of national security. Granting an applicant\u2019s clearance for access to classified information\nis predicated on a high degree of trust and confidence in the individual. Accordingly, decisions under\nthe Directive must include consideration of not just the actual risk of disclosure of such information,\nbut also consideration of any possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently compromise\nclassified information in any aspect of his or her life. Any doubt about whether an applicant should\nbe allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting classified\ninformation.  The decision to deny a security clearance request to an individual is not necessarily\n10\n\nExecutive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n11\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul 11, 1997).\n12\nISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995); Directive, Enclosure 3,\u00b6 E3.1.15.\n13\nISCR Case No. 98-0419 at 5 (App. Bd. Apr. 30, 1995).\n14\n5\na determination of the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant has not met\n11\nthe strict guidelines established by the Department of Defense for issuing a clearance.\nIn accordance with the Directive, the government bears the initial burden of proof in the\nadjudicative process to establish conditions which indicate it is not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information.  When the\n12\ngovernment meets this burden, a heavy burden of persuasion then falls on the applicant to present\nevidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to overcome the position of\nthe government, and to ultimately demonstrate it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant or continue the applicant\u2019s clearance.13\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal\nstandards, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with\nrespect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:\nForeign Influence\nIn a foreign influence case (Guideline B), a security risk may exist when an individual\u2019s\nimmediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by\naffection, influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens of the United States or (2) may be subject to\nduress. Because of an applicant\u2019s ties of affection to these individuals, a potential for foreign\ninfluence arises that could result in the compromise of classified information if an applicant is\nunwilling or lacks the ability to protect classified information. Contacts with citizens of other\ncountries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations, if they\nmake an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.\nForeign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) E2.A2.1.2.1. (An immediate family\nmember or person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or\nresident or present in, a foreign country), applies because Applicant\u2019s mother is a Danish citizen and\nresides in Germany. Such ties raise a prima facie security concern sufficient to require an applicant\nto present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to meet the applicant\u2019s burden\nof persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for him. However, the mere possession of family ties with a person in a foreign country\nis not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. Whether an applicant\u2019s family ties in a\nforeign country pose a susceptibility to foreign influence depends on a common sense evaluation of\nthe overall facts and circumstances of those family ties.14\n\n6\nApplicant\u2019s immediate family live and reside in Germany. Applicant lives with his mother\n(Danish) in Germany. The record is devoid of information concerning his mother\u2019s work or any other\nevidence as to his mother\u2019s contacts with the government of Denmark or Germany. Although, his\nmother has pro-U.S. views and stays in Germany while Applicant\u2019s younger brother attends school.\nI conclude this potentially disqualifying condition applies. FI DC E2.A2.1.2.2. (Sharing living\nquarters with a person or persons, regardless of their citizenship status, if the potential for adverse\nforeign influence or duress exists) applies. \nHowever, Applicant lived abroad with his family as a dependent due to his father\u2019s work with\ncontractors supporting the U.S. military. His father, who is married to Applicant\u2019s mother, has held\na top secret clearance since 1972. His family maintains close contact with the local U.S. community.\nHe has a Status of Forces certification. Applicant has been trained and reports contact to U.S.\nmilitary and civilian agencies, and keeps his security manager up to date on all foreign contacts and\ntravels.  \nWhen completing his security application in 1998, Applicant reported his status as a military\ndependent. He also registered for Selective Service in the United States military. He listed his travels\nto Denmark and within Europe. He reported his university friends.\nForeign Influence Mitigating Condition (FI MC) E2.A2.1.3.1. (a determination that the\nimmediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant,\nor associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a\nforeign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s)\ninvolved and the United States) does not apply. Applicant presented no information about his mother\nand any contacts with the Danish government.\nForeign Preference\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over\nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are\nharmful to the interests of the United States.\nForeign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC) E2.A3.1.2.1. (The exercise of dual\ncitizenship) applies in this case. Applicant renewed and used a Danish passport while a U.S. citizen.\nThis is an exercise of dual citizenship.\nForeign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC) E2.A3.1.2.2. (Possession and/or use\nof a foreign passport) applies in this case. Applicant\u2019s Danish passport was issued shortly after his\nbirth. He was a U.S. citizen at that time. He sometimes traveled in Europe using his Danish passport.\nHe renewed the passport in 2001. \nForeign Preference Mitigating Condition (FP MC) E2.A3.1.3.1. (Dual citizenship is based\nsolely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country) partially applies. Applicant was born in\nGermany and his mother is Danish. His father is a U.S. citizen. Applicant is a U.S. citizen, but also\nDanish citizenship through his mother. This mitigating condition does not totally apply because\nApplicant actively exercised his dual citizenship as an adult by renewing and using his Danish\npassport.\n\nAfroyim v. Rusk, 387 U.S. 253 (1967).\n15\nSchneider v. Rusk, 377 U.S. 163 (1964).\n16\n7\nFP MC E2.A3.1.3.4. (Individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship)\napplies. Applicant was clear in his answers to the SOR and additional statement that  he considers\nhimself loyal to the U.S. and does not maintain a preference for a foreign country. He is willing to\nrenounce his dual citizenship.\nOn August 2000, the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Command, Control, Communications,\nand Intelligence (\u201cMoney Memorandum\u201d) issued a memorandum to clarify the application of\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference, to cases involving possession and or use of a foreign passport. In\npertinent part, the Money Memorandum \u201crequires that any clearance be denied or revoked unless the\napplicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official approval for its use from the appropriate\nagency of the United States. Applicant has surrendered his complied with the requirements of the\nMoney Memorandum and surrendered his passport.\nWhole Person\nI considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in evaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in\nprotecting our national interests. Applicant has been a dual citizen of Denmark and the United States\nsince his birth. He resided in Germany with his family. His father had a top secret clearance since\n1972.  His mother has pro-U.S. views. His family is under the status of forces agreement. He was\neducated in Germany and attended a university in Denmark. He also attended a university in the\nUnited States. In his original security clearance application in 1998, Applicant stated that he would\nconsider giving up his Danish citizenship if required. \nApplicant works for an international business and therefore, has professional  contacts with\nforeign persons. He listed his university friends and his girlfriend on his application and later\nsupporting notarized statements in response to the SOR.\nApplicant surrendered his Danish passport in 2006.  When he was younger, he did use his\nDanish passport to travel within Europe. However, he acknowledged that he also used his U.S.\npassport. He has reported all his on his applications. He has financial interests in the U.S. through\ninvestments and his bank accounts.\nThe United States Supreme Court recognizes a right under the United States Constitution for\nUnited States citizens to maintain dual citizenship with another country.  The eligibility of a United\n15\nStates citizen for dual citizenship with another country, by itself, is not a security concern. The\nUnited States Supreme Court also supports the idea that mere passive retention of dual citizenship\nindicated by a lack of desire to renounce the foreign citizenship for reasons not apparently connected\nto a person\u2019s loyalty to the United States provides no inference of non-allegiance or disloyalty to the\nUnited States. \u201cLiving abroad by a naturalized citizen is no badge of lack of allegiance.\u201d  \n16\nApplicant reported that he has no foreign preference for Denmark or Germany and has chosen\nto register for Selective Service to support the U.S. He acknowledges that he would fully support and\nbe loyal to the U.S. in any conflict.\n\n8\nHis regular contacts with his mother, a Danish citizen and resident of Germany, do not\npresent a concern. Denmark and the United States have been close allies and friends for many years.\nAlthough Denmark is a constitutional monarchy, under its parliamentary form of government, its\ncitizens enjoy the same freedoms as citizens of the United States. Denmark does not illegally detain\nindividuals, nor deny individuals a right to a fair trial. No human rights violations are known to exist.\nDenmark maintains good relationships with the United States in many areas of similar concerns.\nI am persuaded by the totality of the evidence in this case that Applicant does not prefer\nDenmark to his U.S. citizenship. Applicant is proud of his U.S. citizenship. Applicant has mitigated\nthe security concerns under Foreign Influence and Foreign Preference in this case.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

He has been compliant with his medication since this last hospitalization.  His\nPsychiatrist avers that the Applicant is stable and does not pose a security risk.  His Treating\nPsychologist echos this view; and as a result, is ceasing his treatment of the Applicant.  The\nGovernment Psychologist, who last saw the Applicant in April of 2004, avers the Applicant was\nstable and complying with his medication.  Those who know the Applicant, to include two retired\nAir Force Colonels, recommend him for a security clearance.  Mitigation is shown.  Clearance is\ngranted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn May 1, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR on May 26, 2006.\nThe case was received by the undersigned on December 15, 2006.  A notice of hearing was\nissued on January 5, 2007, and the case was heard on January 22, 2007.  The Government submitted\ndocumentary evidence, and called one witness to testify.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant,\nwho also called a witness to testify on his behalf.  The transcript (TR) was received on January 30,\n2007.  The record was left open to receive closing written arguments, which were received in a\ntimely fashion, the Government\u2019s on February 6, 2007, and the Applicant\u2019s on February 13, 2007\n(Appellant Exhibits 1 and 2).  The issue raised here is whether the Applicant's admitted mental\ndisorder militates against the granting of a security clearance.  [The Applicant admits the underlying\nfacts of both allegations.]\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents\nand the live testimony.  The Applicant is 43 years of age, and is employed by a defense contractor,\nwho seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.  After a complete and thorough review\nof the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following\nadditional Findings of Fact.\nGuideline I - Emotional, Mental and Personality Disorders\nThe Applicant was first diagnosed as suffering from a Bipolar Mental Disorder, manic\ndepression, in 1989 (TR at page 65 lines 15~23, at page 157 line 21 to page 158 line 14, and at page\n164 line 16 to page 166 line 6).  At that time he was a 25 year old Petty Officer Second Class in the\n\n3\nU.S. Navy, was hospitalized for \u201ctwo to three month;\u201d and as a result, was subsequently discharged\nfrom the Navy (TR  at page 164 line 16 to page 166 line 6).\nIn 1994, the Applicant went off of his prescribed medication; and as a result, he was\nhospitalized \u201cfor three days\u201d (TR at page 158 lines 15~25).  Since 1994, the Applicant has complied\nwith his medication prescriptions (TR at page 167 line 19 to page 168 line 11, and at page 175 line\n21 to page 176 line 1).\n\n4\n1.a.  Since January of 2000, the Applicant has been under the care of his current Psychiatrist\n(Government Exhibit (GX) 3, but see Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AppXs) D~F).  Most recently, on\nJanuary 11, 2007, his Psychiatrist averred, in part, the following:\n. . . as stated in my subsequent letter [subsequent to GX 3], May 19, 2006, . . . [the\nApplicant] has remained medication-compliant and responsible throughout the six\n(now seven) years I have known him, with only brief and minor mood fluctuations\nthroughout that time.  Furthermore, I anticipate that he will maintain this mood\nstability, and should therefore pose no risk to national security (AppX F).\n1.b.  In April of 2004, the Applicant was evaluated by a Government Psychologist (GX 2).\nThat Psychologist testified at length at the Applicant\u2019s hearing (TR at page 33 line 23 to page 11 line\n25).  When the witness evaluated the Applicant, he exhibited \u201cno manic symptoms,\u201d and the\nmedication seemed to be working (TR at page 66 lines 2~6, and at lines 21~25).  The Government\nPsychologist, in part, reiterated his report in the following terms: \u201c. . . [the Applicant] is currently\nfunctioning very well on his given medication and I don\u2019t see a compromise in judgment or\nreliability\u201d (TR at page 67 lines 3~6).  In answer to the undersigned\u2019s questions, he also averred the\nfollowing:\nJUDGE CEFOLA:  In April 2004, when you saw him, he was being\nmedicated.  Was there a high or low probability of recurrence or exacerbation of his\nmanic depressive condition?\nTHE WITNESS: At that time I would say that . . . if it was based off of what\nI observed . . . [t]hen I think that that(sic) - - it was low at the time; otherwise I\nwouldn\u2019t have written what I did (TR at page 80 lines 15~25).\nThe Applicant\u2019s Treating Psychologist also testified (TR at page 113 line 12 to page 142 line\n5).  The frequency of this Psychologist\u2019s sessions with the Applicant have been decreasing as the\nApplicant is more and more stable (TR at page 116 lines 7~14).  The Applicant\u2019s mental condition\nhas stabilized to the extent that the Psychologist has ceased treating the Applicant (TR at page 124\nlines 2~7).  The witness also offered the following observation of the Applicant, \u201cI have no reason\nto question his reliability or honesty or integrity\u201d (TR at page 126 lines 10~11).\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors and\nconditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern, and which must be given binding\nconsideration in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions should be followed in\nevery case according to the pertinent criterion, however, the conditions are neither automatically\ndeterminative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance\non his own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and\ncircumstances, it should not be assumed that these conditions exhaust the realm of human\nexperience, or apply equally in every case.  As set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the\nrelevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2,\n\n5\nincluding as appropriate:\na. Nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding\ncircumstances.\nb. Frequency and recency of the conduct.\n \nc. Age and maturity of the applicant.\nd. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct\nwas negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of\nthe consequence involved.\ne. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.\nf. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in\nthe future.\nThe Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have\na reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline I (Emotional, Mental, and\nPersonality Disorders) which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's\nadverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to\nsufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,\nexplanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct is unlikely\nto be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.\nAn individual who suffers from a mental disorder may have a defect in judgement, reliability\nor stability.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security\nclearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Applicant is suffering a Bipolar Mental Disorder, which, arguably, in 1989 and again\nin 1994 caused \u201csignificant defects or likely defects in judgment and reliability.\u201d  The first\ndisqualifying condition is therefore applicable as there was an \u201copinion by a credentialed mental\nhealth professional that the individual has a condition that may indicate a defect in judgement,\nreliability, and stability.\u201d  As a result, the Applicant was discharged from the Navy.  This is clearly\n\n6\ncountered, however, by the testimony not only of his treating Psychiatrist and Psychologist, but also\nby the testimony of the Government Psychologist.\nFurthermore, I am not limited to the mitigating conditions, delineated in the Regulation, in\ndeciding if an Applicant has demonstrated extenuation or mitigation.  Here, those who know the\nApplicant best, to include two retired Air Force Colonels, speak most highly of his character,\ncredibility and trustworthiness (AppX G~N).  The totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and\ncircumstances, as set forth at length above, clearly warrants a favorable recommendation under the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  Mitigation is shown.  Guideline I is thus found for the Applicant.\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding his\nmental condition.  The Applicant has thus met the mitigating conditions of Guideline I, and of\nSection E2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion under\nGuideline I.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\na. For the Applicant.\nb. For the Applicant.\nFactual support and reasons for the foregoing are set forth in FINDINGS OF FACT and\nCONCLUSIONS, supra.\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nRichard A.

He only provided the full and correct information before an Independent Counsel in 1999\nafter a grant of immunity. Clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn January 30, 2006, the Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry as amended and modified, and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or\nrevoked.\nIn a sworn written statement, received February 10, 2006, Applicant responded to the\nallegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on February\n7, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued April 20, 2007 for a hearing held on June 14, 2007. The\nGovernment introduced five exhibits, and Applicant introduced 18. All were accepted into evidence.\nApplicant testified on his own behalf. The transcript was received on June 26, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant in his answer denied all of the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.a. and 1.b. and admitted the\nallegation in \u00b6 2.b. relating to personal conduct security concerns. At the hearing he amended his\nanswer to admit the three specific allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.b. After a complete review of the record,\nI make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 55-year-old government contractor and private investigator. He was on active\nduty with the Air Force from 1961-65 and retired from the Air Force Reserve in 2002. He was a civil\nservant with the Army criminal investigative division beginning in 1968 and retired in 2001. In\nAugust of 1993 he was detailed to the White House to evaluate the suitability of applicants for\nWhite House employment. He stayed six months in the position and then went back to his Army job.\nDuring Applicant\u2019s period of assignment to the White House concerns arose in Congress and\nthe media relating to the obtaining of files from the FBI of individuals not working at the White\nHouse which possibly were being reviewed by other persons at the White House for derogatory\ninformation. As a result of these concerns, investigations were begun as to how the requests were\nmade, and the representations to the FBI as to the status of the persons whose files were requested.\nApplicant was interviewed by the FBI concerning his work on files. On June 11, 1996, he testified\nbefore a grand jury and on June 18, 1996, he gave a deposition under oath before staff members of\n\n3\na committee of Congress. On June 26, 1996, he testified under oath before a committee of the House\nof Representatives. \nThree years later Applicant received a grant of immunity from the Independent Counsel who\nwas investigating the Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association. One aspect of that\ninvestigation related to the matters about which he had testified three years earlier before the grand\njury and Congress. He testified before the Independent Counsel on September 11, 1999. After the\ngrant of immunity by the Independent Counsel, Applicant testified truthfully and corrected the\nfalse/inaccurate statements he made three years earlier to the other investigative authorities. \nThe Independent Counsel stated in his final report that Applicant had given untruthful\nanswers in his earlier testimonies under oath and knew, or should have known, that they were not\naccurate (Exh. 3 pp. 8, 60, 75, and 89). However, the report concluded that, although his testimony\nwas false and misleading, there was insufficient evidence to meet the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d\nstandard for a criminal prosecution (Exh. 3 p. 6). Applicant through counsel filed a rebuttal to the\nFinal Report emphasizing certain points in his favor and errors of others that led to some of the\nproblems associated with the investigation (Exh. 4 Attachment 5). \nApplicant admitted at the hearing in this matter that he gave false or inaccurate answers as\nto the performance of his duties in the White House, both before the grand jury and to the\nCongressional staff and the committee of congress in its investigation (Tr. pp. 55, 62 and 64). \nThe allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.c. concerns Applicant\u2019s testimony concerning how he obtained his\nown FBI investigative file while working in the White House. After obtaining the  file he filed a\nlawsuit in 1994 for defamation against two women who had given adverse information about him\nto the FBI. He believed that this information had been the cause of his being denied a promotion in\nthe White House. In a deposition in that litigation he stated that he found the file when it fell on the\nfloor (Tr. 104). In his answer to the SOR in response to the allegation, he stated that he obtained it\nfrom an FBI agent. In his testimony about the matter at the hearing in this proceeding he said he was\nnot truthful because of a desire to protect the FBI agent in question. He also testified in one of the\nCongressional inquiries that he was in his supervisor\u2019s office when the supervisor was called out and\nsome files fell off the desk. When he picked them up he saw his own file and read the pertinent\nportion of it relating to his accusers (Exh. 5). This testimony was at variance with both his testimony\nat the civil trial against his accusers and the answer to the SOR. Applicant dropped the case against\nhis accusers, and he was assessed sanctions and required to pay the legal fees of the two defendants.\nI find his testimony to be not reliable. \nDuring the various investigations, Applicant believed that the concern of the investigators\nrelated to the President and others in the White House and not to the work he was doing. Thus, he\ngave \u201cbroad brush\u201d answers that affected his truthfulness (Tr. 100). Since his return to private life\nin 2001, he now gives depositions that require complete accuracy and he has come to realize the\nimportance of giving full, candid, and precise answers to questions (Tr. 109). \nApplicant is highly regarded by lawyers and judges for whom he has been engaged as an\ninvestigator (Exhs. A, B, I-P). He has received numerous awards over many years for his military\nand civilian service to the country (Exh. C-H). \n\n4\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nAn evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the\nfollowing factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nDirective, \u00b6 E2.2.1. Security clearances are granted only when \u201cit is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 2. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nInitially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the\nevidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which\ndisqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information\nSee Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should\nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7\n3.1(b).\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR:\nThe Government established each of the allegations under Guideline E Personal Conduct\nalleged in the SOR. These alleged false statements raise issues that might indicate questionable\njudgment, unreliability, and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations and could indicate\nthat the person may not properly safeguard classified information. (E2.A5.1.1.) The specific\ncondition applicable to this case is deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning\nrelevant and material matters to an investigator, or other official representative could raise a security\nconcern and be disqualifying (E2.A5.1.2.3.). \nThe conclusions reached in the Final Report of the Independent Counsel state clearly that\nApplicant presented false testimony to the grand jury and the Congress about matters that he knew\nwere not correct or had reason to question there accuracy. (Exh. 3 pp. 1-15, 60. 79-81, 89-90).\nAlthough the report also concludes that the government could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat the statements he made were knowingly false and thus no indictments should be issued, that\ndecision was based on the application of criminal justice standards to which this agency is not bound\nin making security clearance determinations. \n\n5\nMitigating conditions (MC) under Guideline E that might be applicable include that the\nindividual made prompt, good faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification\nbefore being confronted with the facts (E2.A5.1.3.3.), and if the falsification was an isolated\nincident, was not recent, and the individual has subsequently provided correct information\nvoluntarily. (E2.A5.1.3.2) While Applicant is not likely to be confronted with anything similar to\nthe situation that prevailed in 1996 at the White House, he corrected the information given to the\nFBI, a grand jury, and to investigators and a committee of Congress only three years later after\nreceiving a grant of immunity from the Independent Counsel. While time has passed, the offenses\nwere not minor and do cast doubts on Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment.\nHis lack of trustworthiness is compounded by the variant answers Applicant provided over the years\nextending to this proceeding relating to his actions in obtaining his own FBI file and then taking\nlegal action against persons who gave adverse statements about him. \nIn all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons\nwho have access to classified information have an overriding responsibility for the security concerns\nof the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. The \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each\ncase must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and\napplying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. \nIn evaluating his behavior in terms of the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d, an applicant may mitigate\nsecurity concerns by demonstrating the factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur(\u00b6 9),\nthe nature and extent of the conduct (\u00b6 1), and there is evidence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes (\u00b6 6). Although the situations that gave rise to this proceeding may not be likely\nto recur, the SOR allegations all relate to problems of trustworthiness and the requirement to fully\nand frankly answer questions of authorized investigative bodies. In his present career such situations\nare likely to recur. \nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality, and as an integrated whole to focus on the\nwhole person of Applicant, I decline to grant a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS \nFormal findings as required by the Directive (Par. E3.1.25) are as follows:\nParagraph 1. Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.ii:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.iii:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n6\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or renew a security clearance for Applicant.

O\u2019Brien, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant has a history of federal filing failures covering tax years 1993 through 1996, as\nwell as federal tax liens resulting from unpaid tax assessments by federal and state tax authorities\nfor the years in question.  Besides his failure to file timely federal and state tax returns, Applicant\nhas accumulated large tax accruals for the tax years in question, which he has failed to address in any\ndocumented ways, and a 1999 state judgment that was discharged by the garnishment of Applicant\u2019s\nwages.  Applicant fails to mitigate security concerns associated with his failures to file federal tax\nreturns and resulting federal tax liens and a state judgment covering unresolved federal and state tax\nassessments. Allegations of Applicant\u2019s falsifying his security clearance application are\nunsubstantiated.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn July 28, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could\nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral\nto an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or\nrevoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on July 21, 2006, and requested a hearing.  The case was\nassigned to me on December 19, 2006, and was scheduled for hearing on April 25, 2007.  The\nhearing was rescheduled for April 24, 2007.  A hearing was convened on April 24, 2007, for the\npurpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant,\ncontinue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case\nconsisted of 16 exhibits; Applicant relied on two witnesses (including himself) and four exhibits.\nThe transcript (R.T.) was received on May 2, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\nIn advance of the scheduled hearing (on April 17, 2007), Department counsel moved by\nwritten motion to amend sub-paragraph 1.a of the SOR to substitute \u201cthe State of Georgia\u201d for the\n\u201cInternal Revenue Service\u201d and amend sub-paragraph1.c of the SOR to delete the reference in the\nsub-paragraph to the lien not being paid as of July 10, 2005, and add the phase \u201cthe lien was released\non July 19, 2005.\u201d For good cause shown, Department Counsel\u2019s motion was granted.  Based on\ninsufficient evidence to admit or deny the amendment changes, Applicant denied the allegations as\namended (R.T., at 22-25).\nPrior to the close of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to conform\nto the evidence.  Specifically, Department Counsel asked to add a new sub-paragraph 2.b to allege\nApplicant failed to file federal tax returns for at least tax years 1993 through 1996 (R.T., at 135-36).\nFor good cause shown, Department Counsel\u2019s motion was granted.  Based on insufficient\ninformation to admit or deny the amended allegations, Applicant denied the allegations contained\nin new sub-paragraph 2.b of the SOR.\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n3\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to keep the record open to permit\nhim the opportunity to supplement the record with (a) a signed letter from his accountant (admitted\nprovisionally as exhibit D) and copies of any filed tax returns not previously documented, (b)\ndocumentation of release of his tax liens, and (c) character references.  For good cause shown,\nApplicant was granted seven additional days to supplement the record.  The Government, in turn was\nallowed three days to respond.\nWithin the seven-day time period, Applicant furnished one character reference (a letter from\nhis former wife) and requested additional, unspecified  time to provide the letter from his accountant\nand additional character references.  Some three weeks later (on May 21, 2007) he furnished an\nadditional character reference from his human resources manager, which was not objected to and was\naccepted as exhibit E.  \nOver Department Counsel\u2019s objection, and for good cause shown, Applicant was granted\nadditional time (to and including May 30, 2007) to supplement the record.  The Government, in turn\nwas allowed three days to respond.  Within this time period, Applicant did not submit any tax\nreturns, any correspondence from his accountant, documentation of the release of any of the liens\nfiled against him, or payment information regarding any of his creditors within this time period.\nHe did furnish a letter from his human resources manager, which was admitted, over Department\nCounsel\u2019s timeliness objection, as exhibit F.  Applicant did not supplement the record with any other\nsubmissions, and the record closed on May 30, 2007.\nSUMMARY OF PLEADINGS\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have incurred (a) federal tax liens in 2004, 2002\nand 1999 in amounts exceeding  $66,000.00 and (b) a judgment in December 1999, upon which his\nwages were garnished in the approximate amount of $5,104.00 between January and August 2000.\nUnder Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have falsified the security clearance application (SF-86)\nhe completed in June 2000 by omitting the federal tax lien he incurred in May 1999. \nFor his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the federal tax liens filed against him, but\ncontested their validity and accuracy and claimed pending challenges to each of the liens and\nunderlying tax assessments.  He admitted the state judgment entered against him in 1999 and the\nsatisfaction of the judgment through garnishment of his wages.  He denied falsifying his SF-86,\nclaiming the lack of knowledge of any tax lien against him until so informed by the DoD. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\nApplicant is a 52 year-old operations technician for a defense contractor (currently activated\nby Air Force) who seeks to retain his security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and\nadmitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material\nfindings.  Additional findings follow.\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n4\nApplicant married in December 1980, and his wife bore him two children (a son and\ndaughter) during their 14-year marriage.  Since his divorce in 1994, he has not remarried.  He\ncontinued to provide care for his wife and children after the divorce, and resides in State A.  \nBetween 1993 and 1999, Applicant failed to file federal tax returns and state tax returns that\nare linked to the federal returns (see exs. 8 and 13; R.T., at 114-17, 122-24).  He attributes his filing\nfailures to his extensive work commitments that did not afford him sufficient time to prepare his\nfederal and state returns.  Since 1994, his employers have regularly withheld portions of his wages\nfor taxes (R.T., at 117-18).  Because his employers have withheld monies from his wages, he doesn\u2019t\nbelieve he owes the IRS or State G any money for any of the covered years.  \nWhen Applicant did not file federal tax returns for the 1993-1996 tax years, the IRS filed\nreturns for him, based on his estimates of his earnings for the years in question.  And when Applicant\ndid not make any arrangements to pay the determined taxes owing for these years (including accrued\ninterest and penalties), the IRS filed liens against his property interests in his home state to cover the\namounts computed to be owing (see exs. 5 through 7).  Specifically, the IRS filed a tax lien in May\n1999 for $30,635.00, which covered taxes assessed for tax years 1993 through 1995 (see ex. 7), and\none in July 2002 for $14,446.76, covering taxes assessed for 1996 (see ex. 6).  State G, in turn, filed\na state tax lien in February 2004, covering assessed state taxes of $21,239.00.  With accrued interest\nand penalties assessed on the principal federal tax balance for the 1993-1996 period, accrued\nprincipal, interest and penalties for the years in question now exceed $66,000.00.  \nThe IRS released both its February 2004 and May 1999 tax liens against Applicant in July\n2005 . Whether the Service released its liens due to computed credits to the underlying assessment\nsupporting the liens or because of running of statutes of limitations is unclear.  Applicant does not\nknow the reasons for the release; albeit, he continues to claim he has more than paid any taxes due\nthe IRS through years of withholding (R.T., at 133-34).  The record does not reflect any disposition\nof State G\u2019s entered tax lien, and presumably, it remains in place.\nIn July 2003, DOHA propounded a set of interrogatories to Applicant.  Applicant returned\nhis answers in August 2003 (ex. 4).  Responding to questions two and three, he stated that he chose\nto challenge the IRS assessments and retained an accountant (M) to address the IRS\u2019s tax claims (see\nex. 4; R.T., at 106).  Applicant indicated his accountant was committed to refiling tax returns for the\nyears in question and negotiating tax adjustments with the IRS, but had been hampered somewhat\nby the absence of financial records covering his taxes for the 1993 through 1996 tax years. \nApplicant attached two letters from M to the IRS to his interrogatory answers, confirming\nongoing negotiations with the IRS,  and estimated 30 to 60 days to complete and mail the back\nreturns to the IRS. M confirmed in his July 2003 letter that Applicant\u2019s 2002 income tax returns were\n70 to 75 per cent complete and were expected to be completed in the ensuing two seeks.  M advised\nthat the IRS was unwilling, however, to delay collection activity and was intending to levy on\nApplicant\u2019s wages to cover taxes associated with his 1993 to 1996 returns (see ex. 4).  M stated he\nwas involved in ongoing negotiations with the IRS to lower the levy amount based on financial data\nto be furnished by Applicant and M.\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n5\nTo date, Applicant has been unable to resolve his disputes with the IRS over his assessed\ntaxes for the tax years of 1993 through 1996, or the subsequent years of 1997 through 1999.  Nor has\nhe provided documentation of his filing federal and state tax returns for these years (R.T., at 96-97).\nHis accountant (M) continued to furnish updates on ongoing negotiations with the IRS over the same\ntax issues, but without any noted success (see exs. 5 and 10).  M did confirm his filing of federal tax\nreturns for the years 2000 through 2002.  According to M, these returns produced refunds of\n$3,538.00 for these three years, which the IRS was holding back (in addition to funds it was already\nholding) to apply to taxes the IRS claimed were due for the 1993 through 1996 tax years.  In as much\nas M was still in the process of preparing returns for 1997 through 1999, he could not estimate what\nmonies might be due or eligible for refund for these tax years (see ex. 5).  Applicant has not provided\nany further updates on his unresolved tax issues.\nBesides failing to file tax returns for the years 1993 through 1999 and accumulating assessed\ntax deficiencies with the IRS and State G, Applicant was sued by a female acquaintance (A) over\nmonies Applicant was supposed to have invested for her (see exs. 3 and 8; R.T., at 60-61).  The\nacquaintance obtained a judgment against Applicant in State G in December 1999 for $5,104.00 (see\nex. 8). When Applicant did not pay the amount demanded in the judgment, A obtained a garnishment\norder.  Between January and August 2000, A garnished Applicant\u2019s wages in six different\ninstallments to satisfy the amount of the judgment. The garnishment was released in August 2000\n(see ex. 8).\nApplicant earned over $96,000.00 a year in 2003 (with just $62,000.00 in salary and the\nbalance produced from overtime) and listed a net remainder of $88.78 in his August 2003 personal\nfinancial statement (see ex. 4; R.T., at 85-86).  Since his Air Force activation in 2004, he has\ncontinued to receive his full salary from his defense contractor employer, in addition to his active\nduty compensation benefits from the AF (see ex. 4).  He estimates to have made approximately\n$65,000.00 to $70,000.00 in 2006 (R.T., at 92).   Both in his testimony and prior statements (see exs.\n2 and 4), he has indicated an ability to pay any tax assessment determined to be rightfully due and\nowing (see ex. 2).  He has a 401(k) retirement plan with a fund balance of $448,763.46, as of April\n2007 (see ex. A) and timber valued at $100,000.00 or more as of April 2007 (see ex. C), all of which\ncould be drawn on to discharge any sums still due the IRS and State G (R.T., at 67-68).  \nAsked to complete an SF-86 in June 2000, Applicant failed to disclose the tax lien filed by\nthe IRS in May 1999 against his property interests.  Applicant denies ever receiving any notice of\nlien or having any knowledge of a tax lien before filling out his SF-86 (R.T., at 118-19).  Albeit, he\ndid acknowledge in his DSS statement of October 2004 to receiving both threats and liens from the\nIRS, without qualifying which liens he received and when (see ex. 2; R.T., at 68-69, 74-75).  He\nsuspects that his mail was tampered with while he was away on overseas deployments (R.T., at 77-\n78).  After taking down his mailbox, his mail was delivered to a mailbox, which in Applicant\u2019s\nexperience was sometimes diverted elsewhere (R.T., at 100-07). \nWhile Applicant\u2019s stated reasons for removing his mail box are a little puzzling, his\nassurances that he was unaware of the IRS\u2019s 1999 lien notice before executing his SF-86 are\nplausible enough to be accepted, given his 1994 divorce, the absence of mailing certification from\nthe IRS (see ex. 7), and all of the circumstances surrounding his heavy work and single parenting\nresponsibilities (see ex. E).\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n6\nApplicant draws considerable praise from his former wife (see ex. E) and his human\nresources manager with his defense contractor (ex. F).  Both characterize Applicant as an employee\nwho has demonstrated integrity, responsibility and dedication to his work.  His resource manager\ndescribes him as an employee committed to the \u201chighest ethical standards,\u201d and one who has\nconsistently utilized good judgment, decision-making and interviewing skills since she came to know\nhim in 1996 (see ex. F).   Applicant is also highly regarded by his daughter, who describes him as\nvery patriotic and one who would likely sacrifice himself for his country, were he faced with such\nan option in hostile circumstances (R.T., at 51-52).  However, it is unclear whether any of\nApplicant\u2019s character references are fully familiar with the specific security-related concerns raised\nin these proceedings.\nPOLICIES\nThe Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These revised Guidelines require the\njudge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d\n(Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding\nwhether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not\nrequire the judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the\nrelevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for\nassessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2\nof the Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common\nsense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors\nare pertinent herein:\nPersonal Conduct\nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the\nperson may not properly safeguard classified information.\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk at having to engage in illegal\nacts to generate funds.  Unexplained influence is often linked to proceeds from financially profitable\ncriminal acts.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an\napplicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do so is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make\na common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n7\nan applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and\nmateriality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those\ninferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\nJudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged\nin the SOR and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven have a material bearing to the\napplicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of material\nbearing, however, does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant\nhas actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of establishing his\nor her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the\nGovernment's case.\nCONCLUSIONS\nApplicant comes to these proceedings with a long history of meritorious service with his\ndefense contractor, but with security significant issues pertaining to his many of years of failing to\nfile federal and state tax returns, accumulating federal and state tax liens covered by his filing\nfailures, and having his wages garnished to satisfy an unpaid judgment obtained by a female\nacquaintance.  Security significant issues are also raised relative to his omission of the federal tax\nlien filed against his property interests in 1999.\nApplicant\u2019s  non-filing tax issues\nApplicant presents a troubling  history of  failing to file his federal tax returns over a seven-\nyear period (1993-1999). He provides little in the way of specifics about his filing failures:\nDistractions in general attributable to his extensive focus and devotion to his work and family and\nuncertainty over whether his withholdings exceeded what he owed the IRS comprise the rough\nessentials of his  claimed collective failures to address his federal tax returns.  By all reasonable\naccounts, though, his multiple filing omissions meet the wilful test traditionally espoused by the\ncourts.  See United States v. Weninger, 624 F.2d 163, 167 (10th Cir.,), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1012\n(1981)(good faith disagreement over taxes owed, no matter how earnest, cannot avert a conclusion\nof wilful failure to file).\nA taxpayer's wilful failure to file federal income tax returns (as here) constitutes criminal\nconduct of a misdemeanor nature under the federal statutory scheme in place, punishable by fine and\nimprisonment.  See Sec. 7203 of Title 28 (U.S.C.A.). While criminal conduct is not alleged,\nApplicant\u2019s filing omissions still reflect serious judgment lapses covered by the personal conduct\nguidelines of the Directive. One disqualifying condition of the Adjudicative Guidelines for personal\nconduct: E2.A5.1.2.5 (A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations) is applicable here.\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n8\nAlthough Applicant claims to be working on filing his federal tax returns for tax years 1993\nthrough 1999, he provides no documentation of his filing any federal or state tax returns for the years\nin question.   His unexcused filing failures constituted not only criminal misdemeanors under the\nfederal statutory regime in place, but serious lapses in judgment and reliability.\nConsidering the number of years of filing omissions in Applicant's case (seven in all under\nthe governing federal and State G filing requirements in place, which have been only partially\naddressed before the close of the record), the imputed wilful nature of the filing omissions, and the\nabsence of any convincing explanations in the record to temper the manifest wilfulness in Applicant's\nconduct, this is clearly an appropriate case for applying Guideline E in appraising Applicant's overall\nsecurity eligibility.  On this record, Government makes its initial case.\nOf some extenuating value are Applicant's years of dedicated devotion to his work and family\nas a single parent, which consumed most of his time during the years in question.  While his job and\nfamily commitments merit empathy, his experiences provide inadequate cover for why he failed to\ntimely file his federal and State G tax returns for the years in question.  His explanations for failing\nto follow through on filing his tax returns for all of the years in question lack coherency and deprive\nhim of any meaningful extenuating credits.  \nMitigation is unavailing, too, to Applicant.   Not only did he fail to file his federal and state\ntax returns for a considerable number of years, but he failed to take advantage of the opportunity\nafforded him by the interrogatories propounded to him in 2003 and after the hearing to document the\nfiling of his federal and state tax returns for the years in questions and address his federal and state\ntax liens.  To this date, he has failed to demonstrate that he filed any and all of his covered\ndelinquent federal and state returns, much less convince that he has taken care of any federal and\nstate tax delinquencies.  Without more to show for his three-year efforts (at least since August 2003)\nat honoring his federal and state tax filing obligations than he has demonstrated so far, he is not in\na good position to surmount the evidence of his failure to file his federal and state tax returns for the\ncovered years. \nBased on his imputed knowing and wilful to file federal and state tax returns for multiple\nyears, Applicant may not avail of any of the mitigating conditions of the personal conduct guideline.\nOnly MC E2.A5.1.3.5 (The individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress) would appear to have any applicability to\nApplicant\u2019s tax filing failures, and to date he hasn\u2019t provided any documentation of completing\neither federal or state returns for the years in issue.  As a result, this mitigating condition doesn\u2019t\napply.\nApplicant's collective filing failures reflect poor judgment, unreliability and\nuntrustworthiness.  Protecting classified defense information is  much too important to be left to\nuncertainty over an applicant's disposition for diligently addressing his tax filing obligations.   More\nseasoning is needed to appraise Applicant's use of judgment in federal filing compliance situations\nbefore safe predictions can be made about his trust and dependability in handling his tax filing\nresponsibilities, which are requisite to his holding a security clearance.  \n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n9\nApplicant fails at this time to carry his mitigation burden relative to the poor judgment\nallegations ascribed to his multiple tax filing failures.  Conclusions warrant, accordingly, that the\nallegations covered by subparagraph 2.b  under Guideline E are resolved  unfavorably to Applicant.\nApplicant\u2019s financial issues\nApplicant accrued three federal tax liens between 1999 and 2004.  These liens covered\nassessed federal taxes for tax years 1993 and 1999 and exceed $66,000.00 in aggregate taxes, interest\nand penalties assessed.  His accrued federal tax obligations for tax years 1993  through 1995 alone\naccount for over $16,000.00.   While two of these federal tax liens were released in July 2005, the\nreasons for their release remain unknown to Applicant, and he provides no documented proof of\npaying the tax debts that supported these liens.  For lack of any documented returns and payments\nregarding his federal tax liabilities for tax years 1996 and 1999, his accrued federal taxes for these\nyears remain unaccounted for as well. Further, without state filing documentation for the\nunaccounted years in question (i.e., tax years 1993 through 1999), it is not known how much he still\nowes State G in state taxes at this time. Doubts about the status of his state taxes preclude the\ndrawing of any favorable inferences about his being up to date with his state tax obligations at this\ntime.\nConceivably, the IRS released its 1999 and 2004 federal tax liens covering tax years 1993\nthrough 1995 because of the expiration of the controlling federal statute of limitations for enforcing\nunpaid assessments more than 10 years old.  See Sec. 6502(a)of Title 28 (U.S.C.A.).  But without\nmore documentation than this record provides, Applicant may not avail of any possible federal\nstatute of limitation to mitigate security concerns covered by the financial considerations guideline.\nOur Appeal Board has never equated expiration of controlling statutes of limitation with good-faith\nefforts to repay overdue creditors.  See, e.g.,  ISCR Case No. 02-30304, at 3 (App. Bd. April\n2004)(quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020, at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 2001).  \nTo be sure, Applicant did not assert relevant statutes of limitation in his defense, but rather\nhe questioned whether he owed the IRS any money after proper crediting of withholding by his\nemployers.  His subsequent failures to earnestly address these underlying tax debts preclude him\nfrom taking advantage of any of the other mitigating conditions of the financial considerations\nguideline. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s considerable accumulation of delinquent debt, two of the Disqualifying\nConditions (DC) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for Guideline F apply: E2.A6.1.1 (A history of not\nmeeting financial obligations) and.E2.A6.1.3 (Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts).  While his\naccrued debts are accompanied by some extenuating circumstances (viz., reduced job status and\nincreased financial needs of his two children), for the most part his finances have permitted modest\nattempts to pay on his old creditors with the resources available to him since at least July 2003. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are neither extenuated nor mitigated enough to enable him to take\nadvantage of any of the mitigating conditions at this time.  His devotion to meeting his professional\nresponsibilities with his employers and single parent obligations, while commendable, do not excuse\nhis failures to resolve his federal tax liabilities, and possible state tax obligations associated with any\nunresolved federal obligations.  Significant delinquent debt attributable to an applicant that is neither\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n10\nextenuated nor mitigated by good-faith resolution raises implicit security risks over the potential for\nneeded funds and recurrent judgment lapses.  The government does not have to wait until an\nindividual mishandles or fails to safeguard classified information before it can make an unfavorable\nsecurity clearance decision.  Cf. Adams v. Laird, 420 F.2d 230, 238-39 (DC Cir. 19969), cert. denied,\n397 U.S. 1039 (1970). \nTaking into account all of the circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s accumulated tax debts\nover the past 14 years, the absence of sufficient attention he has shown with his tax filing\nresponsibilities and associated tax debts in the past, and his failure to follow through on his filing\nand repayment commitments he made in his 2003 answers to interrogatories propounded to him by\nDOHA, Applicant fails to mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns at this time.  Unfavorable\nconclusions warrant, accordingly, with respect to subparagraphs 1.a through 1.d of the allegations\nin the SOR governed by the Adjudicative Guidelines pertinent to Guideline F.\nPersonal Conduct issues associated with Applicant\u2019s clearance application\nSecurity concerns over Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability and trustworthiness are raised under\nthe personal conduct guideline, too, as the result of his omissions of his 1999 federal tax lien in the\nSF-86 application he completed in June 2000.  By omitting the tax lien attributable to him, Applicant\nfailed to furnish materially important background information about IRS action taken against him\nto enforce a tax obligation.  This information was needed for the Government to properly process\nand evaluate his security clearance application. \nApplicant\u2019s SF-86 omissions are attributable to his lack of received notice of the lien or any\nknowledge of the lien at the time he completed his SF-86.  Applicant\u2019s impressions at the time, while\npotentially mistaken (based on the absence of furnished documentation in the record), were made\nin good faith, without any indicated intent to mislead.  Applicant\u2019s explanations, considering both\nthe circumstances surrounding the furnished information at the time and Applicant\u2019s overall\nreputation for honesty and trustworthiness among his friends and colleagues who know him well,\nenable him to convincingly refute the falsification allegations. \nConsidering all of the evidence produced in this record, favorable conclusions warrant with\nrespect to the personal conduct allegations that Applicant knowingly and wilfully omitted his 1999\nfederal tax lien when completing his security clearance application.  Favorable conclusions warrant,\naccordingly, concerning sub-paragraph 2.a of the SOR pertinent to Guideline E.\nIn reaching my recommended decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E2.2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n \nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the context of\nthe FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS, CONDITIONS, and the factors listed above, this\nAdministrative Judge makes the following FORMAL FINDINGS:\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n11\nSub-para. 1.a:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.b:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.c:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.d:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.a:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.b:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nDECISIO N\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

His father and three brothers are citizens and residents of Morocco.  His mother lives in\nthe U.S., as do two brothers who are U.S. citizens.  He renounced his Moroccan citizenship and\nsurrendered his Moroccan passport.  A criminal arrest charge was expunged because he was\nerroneously charged.  He falsely answered several questions on a security clearance application.\nUsing the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d he successfully mitigated the security concerns about foreign\ninfluence, foreign preference, criminal conduct, and personal conduct.  Clearance is granted.\n\nGovernment Exhibit 1 (Security Clearance Application (SF 86), dated April 30, 2001).\n1\nTr. at 12.\n2\nId. at 13.\n3\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn April 30, 2001, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).   The\n1\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance\nfor Applicant.  As required by Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within\nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on March 10, 2004, detailing the\nbasis for its decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), Guideline\nC (Foreign Preference), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the\nDirective.  After submitting his security clearance application, it was two years before the SOR was\nissued.  It took another three years before the case was assigned to me for a hearing.  Department\nCounsel advised that the file was returned to the DOHA office in Columbus, Ohio for further\ninvestigation, and it was over two years before the file was returned to DOHA.  Since receiving that\ninformation, counsel was trying to determine whether or not Applicant was represented by counsel,\nand it took a bit of time to determine his representation status with his former attorney.  \nThe President issued revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) on December 30, 2005.  DoD\nimplemented them on September 1, 2006.  Pending official amendment/reissue of DoD Directive\n5220.6, the AG are to be used in all cases when the SOR is dated on or after September 1, 2006.\nBecause the SOR was dated before September 1, 2006, DoD policy requires that this case proceed\nunder the former guidelines.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on April 21, 2004, and elected\nto have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on March 1, 2007,\nand a Notice of Hearing was dated on March 20, 2007.  I convened a hearing on April 25, 2007, to\nconsider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's\nsecurity clearance.  The government offered thirteen exhibits, marked as Exhibits 1-13.  Applicant\noffered five exhibits, marked as Exhibits A-E.  All exhibits were admitted without objection.  After\nthe hearing, Applicant submitted two documents that were marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits F and G.\nThe government had no objection and the exhibits were admitted.  DOHA received the transcript\n(Tr.) on May 4, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations contained in SOR subparagraphs 1.a., 1.i., and 1.j.  He\ndenied all other allegations in the SOR.  The admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of\nsame, I make the following additional findings of fact:  Applicant is a 43-year-old armed security\nofficer employed by a federal government contractor.   He is married and has five children.   He is\n2\n3\na high school graduate and has one year of college credit, and is actively pursuing an associate\n\nId. at 16.\n4\nId. at 12-15.\n5\nId. at 12.\n6\nId. at 115-16.\n7\nId. at 42-43.\n8\nId. at 39.\n9\nId. at 68-69.\n10\nId. at 22-23.\n11\nId. at 54-55.\n12\nId. at 26.\n13\nId. at 54.\n14\nId. at 27.\n15\n4\ndegree.   He served in the United States Army from 1995 to 2001.  He served in the Army National\n4\nGuard in 1995 and 1996, and rejoined the Guard from 2001 until 2004.  He received an honorable\ndischarge from the Army and attained the rank of sergeant (E-5).  He served in Korea, Kosovo, and\nOperation Noble Eagle, and has held a clearance since 1995.   He has a 30% veteran\u2019s disability.\n5\n6\nHe has provided armed security protection for several cabinet secretaries, several government\nbuildings, and worked a security detail at the United Nations.   He is also a translator.   He never\n7\n8\nserved in the Moroccan military.9\nHe owns a home and rental property in the U.S.  He has a checking, savings and money\nmarket accounts.  He votes in elections, and is a member of the American Legion.  He has coached\nhis son\u2019s soccer team, and is active with the Boy Scouts.10\nForeign Influence\nApplicant\u2019s parents are citizens of Morocco, currently residing in Morocco three months  a\nyear and nine months in the United States.  Three brothers are citizens and residents of Morocco.\nOne of them is in the U.S. attempting to get his green card.  The other two anticipate trying to get\ngreen cards.   A fourth brother is a citizen of Morocco, currently residing in the United States.  A\n11\nfifth brother is a citizen of and living in the U.S.  There is no evidence to indicate they are involved\nin any \"intelligence work\" for the Moroccan Government, and they have no \"official ties\" to the\nMoroccan Government.  He has rare contact with his father or brothers in Morocco.  His mother is\nin the U.S.   His son is a citizen of the United States currently residing in the U.S.   He pays child\n12\n13\nsupport to the boy\u2019s mother.   He traveled to Morocco in March 1999 and December 2000, and has\n14\nnot returned since.   His father was in the construction business with one of his brothers, but is\n15\n\nId. at 49-53.\n16\nId. at 40-41.\n17\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit A (Letter of Renunciation, dated March 22, 2007) at 1; Tr. at 27.\n18\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit B (Expungement Order, dated February 14, 2005) at 2-3.\n19\nTr. at 31.\n20\n5\nretired and in poor health, having suffered a stroke.  He returned to Morocco because he could not\nobtain health insurance in the U.S.   The other is a welder-fabricator.\n16\n17\nForeign Preference\nApplicant exercised a dual citizenship with Morocco and the United States.  He was\ninterviewed by an investigator from the Defense Security Service (DSS) on January 25, 2002.  At\nthat time he possessed a Moroccan passport that was issued January 9, 1992.  The passport expired\nJanuary 9, 1997, but only needed to be stamped to be renewed.  He also possessed a Moroccan\ngovernment identification card, which expired in February 2001.  On March 22, 2007, he delivered\na letter to the Embassy of Morocco in which he renounced his citizenship and surrendered his\npassport and Moroccan ID card.18\nCriminal Conduct\nSOR subparagraph 3.a. alleged his arrest on May 14, 1995, for a charge of embezzlement,\na felony.  The charge was nolle prosequi.  Subsequently, it was determined that the charge was made\nin error, and all police and court records filed were ordered  expunged on February 14, 2005.   The\n19\ngovernment alleged criminal conduct under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 for making false answers on his\nsecurity clearance application.\nPersonal Conduct\nOn a questionnaire for national security positions, executed by Applicant on March 30, 2001,\nhe was required to answer the following questions:\n6.  Your Employment Activities  List your employment activities, beginning with\nthe present and working back 10 years.  You should list full time work, part time\nwork, military service, temporary military duty locations over 90 days, self-\nemployment, other paid work, and all periods of unemployment.\nHe failed to list that he had been employed in a retail store from 1994 to 1995.  He was mistakenly\ncharged with embezzlement by his employer.  His recruiter told him that since the case was still\npending dismissal, he didn\u2019t have to list it.20\n9.  Your Relatives and Associates  Entry List Options: 1.  Mother  2.  Father  3.\nStepmother  4.  Stepfather  5.  Foster parent  6.  Child (adopted also).  7.  Stepchild.\n8.  Brother  9.  Sister 10.

He believes it was a misunderstanding, as he and the investigator\nargued about his entry into the U.S.  He took and passed a polygraph test.   He said he did not\n21\nunderstand the forms.22\n16.  Foreign Countries You Have Visited  and he traveled outside the United States\non other than unofficial  U.S.  Government orders in the last 7 years?  (Travel as a\ndependent or contractor must be listed.)  Do not repeat travel covered in modules 4,\n5, and 6.\nHe failed to list his travel to Morocco in 1999 and 2000.\n23.  Your Police Record  For this item, report information regardless of whether the\nrecord in your case has been \u201csealed\u201d or otherwise stricken from the court record.\nThe single exception to this requirement is for certain convictions under the Federal\nControlled Substances Act for which the court issued an expungement order under\nthe authority of U.S.C. \u00a7 844 or 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3607.  a.  Have you ever been charged\nwith or convicted of any felony offense (include those under Uniform Code of\nMilitary Justice).\nHe responded \u201cNo\u201d, failing to list the felony charge in May 1995, as set forth in SOR subparagraph.\n3.a.  His recruiter told him he did not have to list it.\nMorocco is a country with a developing economy and agriculturally-based employment.  It\nis a constitutional monarchy with a parliament.   The king has the power to terminate any minister,\n23\ndissolve the Parliament, call for new elections, or rule by decree.   Arabic is the official language\n24\n\nId. at 1.\n25\nId. at 5-8.\n26\nGovernment Exhibit 11, supra, note 8, at 1-2.\n27\nGovernment Exhibit 12(U.S. Department of State, Office of the Coordinator of Counterterrorism, Country Reports on\n28\nTerrorism, dated April 2006) at 141-142.\nId. at 142.\n29\nGovernment Exhibit 11, supra, note 8, at 1-2.\n30\nGovernment Exhibit 13, supra, note 8, at 1.\n31\nGovernment Exhibit 11, supra, note 8, at 4-5.\n32\n7\nand 99% of the population is Muslim.   Morocco is a moderate stable, democratizing Arab nation\n25\nwith whom the United States enjoys strong ties and good relations.26\nHowever, terrorism has been a problem in Morocco.  A series of terrorist bombings occurred\nin Casablanca in May 2003.   Suicide bombers affiliated with the Salafiya Jihadiya movement\n27\ncommitted several attacks, killing 45 people.  Other persons from Salafiya Jihadiya were arrested\nin March 2005, for planning terrorist attacks in Morocco.  The Moroccan government also\ndiscovered that some of its citizens have traveled to Algeria and trained with the Algerian terrorist\ngroup GSPC.   Moroccan terrorists have also committed a tax outside of Morocco.  The al-Qaida-\n28\naffiliated Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group (GICM) has been implicated in the March 2004\nMadrid, Spain train bombings.   Based upon terrorism concerns the U.S. Government warns that\n29\nthere is a high potential for violence against American interests and citizens in Morocco.30\nThe human rights record of Morocco is poor in many areas.  Human rights problems include\nuse of excessive force against demonstrators, unresolved cases of disappearance, allegations of\ntorture, poor prison conditions, arbitrary arrest and detention, police and security force impunity, and\ncorruption and lack of transparency in the government.31\nAll persons born to Moroccan fathers are considered Moroccan citizens.  Such persons are\nsubject to all Moroccan laws.  U.S. citizens who are dual-nationals, therefore, are subject to all\nMoroccan laws, and also may be subject to other laws that impose special obligations.  Finally,\nMorocco sometimes places foreign citizens under surveillance.32\nA former co-worker described Applicant as very -\nloyal, dependable, he always comes to work, and he works.  Some people come to\nwork just to get paid.  But he actually came to work to work.  You asked him to hold\nover, he holds over without any complaints.  We trust him to join the military.  We\ntrain him and stuff that average civilians don\u2019t know about, and we trusted him with\nthat.  We trusted him working for a government Department, because anybody can\u2019t\ndo that.  He worked for the Reagan funeral, and he has worked at Blair House and the\n\nId. at 81-82.\n33\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\n34\nin light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\n8\nUnited Nations.  He\u2019s definitely trustworthy.  I put a job in his hands several times,\nand he never let me down.33\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines.  In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into\nDisqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, recognizing\nthe complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed below.  An administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal\nis a fair, impartial and common sense decision.\nBecause the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security.\u201d  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those\nconclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise,\nI have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d  The\ngovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a potentially disqualifying\ncondition under the Directive.  Once the government has produced substantial evidence of a\ndisqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating\ncondition.   Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and\n34\n\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v.Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  ?The Administrative Judge [considers] the record\n35\nevidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, [evaluates] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of\npertinent provisions of the Directive, and [decides] whether Applicant [has] met his burden of persuasion under Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  The Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence\n36\n \nas a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent\nprovisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n9\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable clearance decision.\u201d  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the\ngovernment.  \n35\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship the\ngovernment must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to\nwhom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,\nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty,\nand patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically\nprovides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall\nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  Security clearance\ndecisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.\nNothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or\nin part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.36\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline B\u2014Foreign Influence\nWith respect to Guideline B, the Government has established its case.  Applicant has been\nportrayed as a person who is a potential security risk because members of his immediate family or\npersons to whom he is bound by affection, influence, or obligation--in this instance, Applicant's\nparents, and his three brothers --are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.\nThis situation raises the potential for vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or pressure, and the\nexercise of foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  In\nsupport of its contentions, the Government has cited the fact Applicant's parents and siblings are\ncitizens and residents of Morocco.  Based on my review of the evidence, I conclude the security\nconcerns manifested by the Government, in this instance, are largely unfounded.\n\n10\nIt is uncontroverted that Applicant's parents and siblings--persons to whom he has close ties\nof affection--are citizens and residents of Morocco.  That simple fact, standing alone, is sufficient\nto raise security concerns over the possibility of Applicant's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation,\nor pressure.  However, the mere possession of family ties with a person in a foreign country is not,\nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B.\nThe language of [Guideline] B (Foreign Influence) in the Adjudicative Guidelines makes\nclear that the possession of such family ties may pose a security risk.  Whether an applicant's family\nties in a foreign country pose a security risk depends on a common sense evaluation of the overall\nfacts and circumstances of those family ties.  See ISCR Case No. 98-0419 (April 30, 1999) at p. 5.\nApplicant's father and three of his five siblings live in Morocco.  The other two siblings are\nU.S. citizens.  There is no evidence to indicate they are involved in any \"intelligence work\" for the\nMoroccan Government, and they have no \"official ties\" to the Moroccan Government.  These facts,\nwhen considered in light of the nature of the government in Morocco--a friendly Kingdom which\nis not hostile to the United States, and whose interests are not inimical to the United States--\nfacilitates an analysis involving the adjudicative guidelines and the various applicable conditions set\nforth therein.\nThe residence and citizenship of Applicant's family members are clearly of security concern\nunder foreign influence disqualifying condition (DC) E2.A2.1.2.1., but the significance of that ruling\nis mitigated by the \"protection\" afforded by foreign influence mitigating condition (MC)\nE2.A2.1.3.1.  It must also be noted Applicant's mother lives in and intends to become a citizen of\nthe United States.  In this instance, after an examination of the evidence, I determine that Applicant's\nparents and siblings, considering their citizenship and residency status, do not constitute an\nunacceptable security risk.  Furthermore, their continuing personal relationship is viewed in positive\nterms, having no security significance.  He has no contact with his family in Morocco.   \nGuideline C\u2014Foreign Preference\nE2.A3.1.1. The Concern: When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference\nfor a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or\nmake decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.  The government failed to make\nits case because Applicant had renounced his Moroccan citizenship, and turned over to the Moroccan\nEmbassy his passport and his Moroccan government ID card, prior to the hearing.  And his dual\ncitizenship was based solely on his parents' citizenship and  birth in a foreign country.  I conclude\nGuideline C for Applicant.\nGuideline J\u2014Criminal Conduct\nEven though the government established its case under Criminal Conduct Disqualifying\nCondition  (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1. (Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of\nwhether the person was formally charged), the fact that the charge was based on mistake and both\nthe arrest and court records have been expunged by court order acts to mitigate the concern.  The\ncharge is not only void, but it is void ab initio.  As I have found for Applicant under Guideline E,\nthis negates the allegations of criminal conduct pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.\n\nISCR Case No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 17, 2006) (footnotes omitted); accord ISCR Case No. 03-23259 at 3\n37\n(App. Bd. May 10, 2006).\nDirective, \u00b6 E2.2.1.8.\n38\n11\nGuideline E\u2014Personal Conduct Whole Person Analysis\nI had the opportunity to evaluate the demeanor of Applicant, observe his manner and\ndeportment, appraise the way in which he responded to questions, assess his candor or evasiveness,\nread his statements, listen to his testimony, and watch the interplay between himself and those\naround him.  It is my impression Applicant's explanations are both consistent and sincere, and have\nthe solid resonance of truth.  Thus, I conclude Applicant has, through evidence of extenuation and\nexplanation, successfully mitigated and refuted the Government's case in this regard. \nWhole Person Concept\nIn assessing whether an applicant is a security risk because of his or her relatives or associates\nin a foreign country, it is necessary to consider all relevant factors.  As noted above, \u00b6\u00b6 E2.2.1,\nE2.2.2, and E2.2.3 of the Directive specifically require each administrative judge to consider all the\nfacts and circumstances, including the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, when evaluating each individual\ncase.  To ignore such evidence would establish a virtual per se rule against granting clearances to any\nperson with ties to persons in a foreign country, contrary to the clear terms of the Directive.\n\u201cAlthough the position of an applicant\u2019s foreign family members is significant and may preclude the\nfavorable application of FI MC E2.A2.1.3.1., the totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances\n(including the realistic potential for exploitation) may still warrant a favorable application of the\nrelevant general factors.\u201d37\nMost importantly, it is necessary to consider Applicant\u2019s vulnerability to exploitation through\nhis relatives.  Applicant is a mature individual with almost ten years of successful military service\nto this country.  He is a U.S. citizen and was educated in this country.  Applicant has strong ties to\nthe United States.  He votes, he has financial ties including rental property, he has coached a soccer\nteam, and is active with the Boy Scouts.  In his civilian employment, he has provided close security\nfor major government officials.  More and more of his family are immigrating to the U.S.  Because\nof Applicant\u2019s deep and long-standing relationships and loyalties in the U.S., he can be expected to\nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States.  I find the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress does not constitute a security risk.   I conclude it is clearly\n38\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

ABLARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nEric H. Borgstrom, Esq. , Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nApplicant, a 66-year-old employee of a defense contractor who has held a security clearance\nfor 44 years, mitigated security concerns over allegations of security violations under Guideline K\nover the past 34 years through an analysis of the specifics of the incidents as well as passage of time\nsince the earliest in 1973. He also mitigated personal conduct allegations relating to inconsistent\nstatements to investigators in 1973 and 2002 by establishing that the inconsistencies were not\ndeliberate. Clearance is granted. \nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn July 7, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, as amended and\nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or\nrevoked.\nOn August 24, 2005, Applicant responded to the allegations with ten documents appended\nto his answer and requested a hearing. The matter was assigned to me on February 12, 2007. A notice\nof hearing was issued on May 8, 2007, for a hearing held on May 3l, 2007. Eleven government\nexhibits and one Applicant exhibit were admitted into evidence in addition to those appended to his\nanswer. Applicant testified on his own behalf. The record was left open for 30 days for additional\nmaterial from Applicant and seven documents were received and admitted into evidence without\nobjection. The transcript was received on June 14, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted, with explanation, five of the allegations under Guideline K Security\nViolations and denied three others. He denied three allegations under Guideline E Personal Conduct.\nAfter a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration of the entire\nrecord, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 66-year-old employee of a major defense contractor who has held a security\nclearance for 44 years. He was a Navy employee for 36 years before retiring in 2000 to take his\npresent employment. During the last 34 years allegations have been made of eight security violations.\nThe following is an analysis of those incidents and allegations:\nl. SOR 1.a. b. and c. These three allegations relate to one incident in 1973 when Applicant\nremoved classified documents  from his government office, failed to properly protect it at his\nhome, and lost some of those documents near his home when he left a zipper case containing\nthe documents on top of his car as he was leaving to pick up a co-worker to go to an airport\nfor a one-day trip. The case fell off the car and was picked up by a neighbor who worked in\n\n3\nthe same government office. He reported finding the case to the local police who contacted\nthe Navy. \nWhen Applicant reached the airport he realized the case was missing. He called another\nneighbor to see if he could find it but could not. When Applicant came home that night, he\nattempted to find the case without success but by that time the Navy investigators had\nretrieved it from the police. He advised his supervisor when he returned to work the\nfollowing day and was called by the security office before he could contact them. He was\ninterviewed by security officers on the day after he advised his supervisor. No punishment\nor reprimand was given and the matter stayed in the file a few years and then was dropped.\nThis incident also prompted the allegation in SOR 2 c.(Tr. 41-48 and Exh. 6 and 10). \n2. SOR 1.d. In the 36 years between 1964 and 2000, Applicant on three to five occasions, or\nonce every seven to ten years, failed to lock his classified storage container and/or left\nclassified material on his desk at his government office overnight. No government evidence\nwas produced on this allegation and the information was voluntarily provided by Applicant\nin an interview. \n3. SOR 1.e. This incident involved an email sent by Applicant in 1997 while a government\nemployee  that included some classified data which he did not know was classified. He did\nnot originate the email but received it from another person and forwarded it to a third person.\nHe received a call from that person asking if some of the information in it might be\nclassified. Applicant asked the originator who determined that some of it was classified.\nThere was no report on the incident and the information on this allegation came to light when\nApplicant revealed it in an interview (Tr. 58). \n4. SOR 1.f. This incident occurred in 2001 when he was employed by his present employer.\nHe marked some working papers that were unclassified with some classified numbers thus\ncreating a classified document if taken in context (Tr. 64). The matter was dealt with by the\ncompany by giving Applicant an extensive briefing on what constitutes working papers. \n5. SOR 1.g. This incident occurred in May 2002 when he left his office for only a minute to\ntalk to a colleague without securing his classified storage container in violation of company\nrules and in violation of the NISPOM. He was charged with a security violation, the\ncombination of the container was changed, and access to it was denied for two weeks and he\nwas given refresher training. A year later he received a reprimand (Tr. 35). \n6. SOR 1 h. This allegation relates to alleged conduct during a one year period between May\n2002 and April 2003 when he left classified material unsecured in his office which had not\nbeen approved for storage of such approximately two to three times per week when\nprohibited by company rules and the NISPOM. A practice was developed after the May 2002\nincident to permit Applicant to lock his office door rather than placing documents in the\nlocked safe. This was approved by the facility manager and the security officer. However,\nwhen superior officials in the company learned of the new procedure several months later\nboth of the officers were reprimanded along with Applicant (Exh. A 8). He did not request\nthis new procedure but it was initiated by the security officer (Tr. 116). After the new\nprocedure stopped, Applicant has followed stricter requirements that were placed in effect.\n\n4\n7. SOR 2.b. In addition to the above specific allegations under Guideline K, this allegation\nis under Guideline E and relates to an email he received in 2001 from another employee\nallegedly containing classified material and he forwarded it to another employee and was\ncited for a security violation. The originator of the email stated that there was no classified\nmaterial in it (Exh. A 6).\nAs a result of the incidents with his employer from 2001 to 2003 Applicant was denied a\nsecure safe in his office. He has voluntarily declined access to an office secure safe but goes to the\nFSO or to a colleague to obtain documents needed for his work (Tr. 79). Since 2003, Applicant has\nhad no security violations. \nIn addition to the above SOR allegations, an allegation under Guideline E (SOR 2.b.) relates\nto a statement provided to a government investigator in 2002 (Exh. 6) wherein, relating to the 1973\nincident almost 30 years earlier, he stated that he reported the incident \u201cto security\u201d at his\ngovernment employment when he realized the documents were missing. The government alleges that\nthis was untrue and that it was not reported until he was confronted by Navy investigators a day after\nthe loss as he stated in his hand-written statement submitted in 1973 (Exh. 10). \nApplicant is highly regarded as an extremely hard worker who is a valuable asset to the\nhighly technical programs on which he works. When he retired from federal service in 2000 he\nreceived the highest award given in his field. He is regarded as reliable and trustworthy by his\nsupervisor and colleagues. He holds a BS degree in electronics engineering with some post-graduate\nstudies but no graduate degree. He is regarded as someone who follows security procedures and\nunderstands their requirements (Exhs.C 2-7). He expressed concern and regret about the number of\nsecurity violations that have occurred during his career and has taken steps to insure they do not\nrecur. None have occurred during the last four years.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nAn evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration\nof the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nDirective, \u00b6 E2.2.1. Security clearances are granted only when \u201cit is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 2. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nInitially, the government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the\nevidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which\ndisqualify, or may disqualify, applicant from being eligible for access to classified information See\n\n5\nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. \u201cAny doubt as to whether access\nto classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must,\non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR:\nApplicant has had a number of security violations and other incidents which prompted\nsecurity concerns under Guideline K (Security Violations) since noncompliance raises doubt about\nan individual\u2019s trustworthiness, willingness, and ability to safeguard classified information.\n(E2.A11.1.2.) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include\nunauthorized disclosure of classified information (E2.A11.2.1.), and violations that are deliberate\nor multiple or due to negligence (E2.A11.2.2.). \nThere are several mitigating conditions that might be applicable include violations that were\ninadvertent (E2.A11.1.3.1.), or isolated or infrequent (E2.A11.1.3.2.), or that an individual\u2019s actions\ndemonstrate a positive attitude towards the discharge of security responsibilities (E2.A11.1.3.3.).\nAn objective analysis of the security incidents alleged in the SOR leads to the conclusion that\nthere is less than meets the eye from what a cursory review might indicate since they stretch over a\n44-year career. The 1973 incident which resulted in three SOR allegations probably was the most\nsignificant and egregious, although it was also the oldest since it happened almost 35 years ago.\nHowever, the incident apparently had a salutary effect in sensitizing him to security requirements\nin that there were only 3-5 incidents over the 36 year period of his government service between 1964\nand 2000. These involved leaving classified material on his desk in his Navy office. One of these\nwas the 1997 email incident (SOR 1.e.) which I would characterize as inadvertent. The others during\nthat period are over such an extended period that I consider them isolated and infrequent.  \nThe most recent incidents occurred in 2001, 2002, and 2003 and, while three in number over\na three year period,  appear to be of minimal significance due to the circumstances of the violations.\nThe first involved the working papers that he annotated with some classified numbers and\nappropriate action was taken to remedy the problem in the form of briefings. The second involved\nfailure to secure his storage container for classified documents for a few minutes. This resulted in\nappropriate action and his supervisors then changed some procedures to permit some leeway to allow\nhim to leave material on his desk if the office door was locked. He followed the new requirements\nbut the supervisors were then disciplined for making the change in violation of company security\npolicy and requirements. Applicant was also cited for violations of security requirements when he\nfollowed a procedure that had been approved by his supervisors. Since that time he has declined\naccess to a classified safe while still working on classified material. \nThe government cited ISCR Case No.00-0030 Appeal Board (September 20, 2001), as a\nseminal case involving a claim that an applicant should not be punished when his superiors were not.\nHere the superiors and Applicant were all punished. Applicant continues to work on classified\n\n6\nmaterial but has taken appropriate steps to insure that new violations will not occur. Combined with\nthe regrets for his lapses and a showing of renewed understanding about importance of protecting\nclassified information I conclude that his positive actions provide mitigation. (See also ISCR Case\nNo.04-08749 (July 23, 2007). \nThe allegation under Personal Conduct (SOR 2 c) relating to his inconsistent statements\ngiven in 1973 and 2002 raised security concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The concern\nis that conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard\nclassified information. (E2.A5.1.1.) The conditions that could raise concerns includes deliberately\nproviding false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator\nin connection with a security determination (E2.A5.1.2.3.).\nThe inconsistencies in Applicant\u2019s statements related to the actions taken when the 1973\nsecurity breach occurred, raised the question of his truthfulness. The statement he made\ncontemporaneously with the event where he carefully detailed the events is certainly more credible\nthan the 2002 statement where he was being interviewed about all of the incidents and rather off-\nhandedly said he had notified security when he learned the documents were missing.\nHowever, the lapsed time of 30 years could well diminish his memory as to if, what, and\nwhen he notified authorities. At the hearing, he reviewed the 1973 interview, found that it refreshed\nhis memory, and was accurate. I conclude that the inconsistency was not deliberate as required by\nthe guideline. In view of my findings as to SOR 1, I conclude that the cross-allegations (SOR 2.a.\nand b.) under Guideline E are also mitigated. \nIn all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons\nwho have access to classified information have an overriding responsibility for the security concerns\nof the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. \nThe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of their acts\nand omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant\ncircumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. Based on that\nanalysis, I conclude that the reputation of Applicant, the age of the earlier the security violations, his\nrecord of work stability, his efforts to remedy against any possibility of further violations, and the\nunlikelihood of a recurrence, justifies application of the whole person analysis. \nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality, and as an integrated whole to focus on the\nwhole person of Applicant, I conclude it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a\nsecurity clearance to him.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings as required by the Directive (Par. E3.1.25) are as follows:\nParagraph 1.

Stevens, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nGeorge E. Rippel, Jr., Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On April 28, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis\nfor that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline\n\n2\nH (Drug Involvement) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive). Applicant requested a decision on the written record. On November 15, 2006, after\nconsidering the record, Administrative Judge Jacqueline T. Williams denied Applicant\u2019s request for\na security clearance.  Applicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant has raised the following issues on appeal: whether some of the Judge\u2019s findings\nare supported by substantial record evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s decision that the security\nconcerns had not been mitigated was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we\naffirm.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: \nApplicant is an employee of a defense contractor who has held a security clearance since\n1977.  Applicant has consumed alcohol, \u201cat times to excess and to the point of intoxication, to\ninclude one pint of vodka daily,\u201d from 1966 until 2002.  On various occasions from October 6, 1991,\nto at least April 12, 2004, Applicant received medical treatment for a diagnosis of \u201calcoholism in\npartial remission.\u201d  In September 1994, Applicant\u2019s employer recommended that he attend the\nEmployee and Family Assistance Program (EFAP) due to his having missed work due to alcohol\nabuse.  From November 1994 until March 2002, Applicant received both inpatient and outpatient\nalcohol treatment.  \nFrom 1999 to at least 2001, Applicant used cocaine, varying from twice a week to once a\nmonth.  From July 24, 2001 until August 1, 2001, Applicant was treated for cocaine dependency. \n\u201cThe record evidence is contrary to Applicant\u2019s denial of cocaine use.  Based on the above\nmentioned diagnosis, Applicant used cocaine and was untruthful in his denial.\u201d\nApplicant has attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) with varying frequency from 1994 until\n2001 and again in April 2002.  The file contains a letter from Applicant\u2019s sponsor, attesting to his\nprogress in dealing with alcoholism.  However, the letter does not reflect that the sponsor was aware\nof Applicant\u2019s problem with cocaine.  \nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as\nadequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  Directive\n\u00b6  E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s findings\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S.\n607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give deference to the\nJudge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.32.1. \n\nApril 24, 2001.  \n1\nApplicant was admitted for inpatient treatment for alcohol and cocaine dependency on July 24, 2001.  \n2\nThis document is entitled \u201cCertified Results of Interview\u201d and summarizes Applicant\u2019s statements to the\n3\ninvestigator.  The document contains the following: \u201cThis summary was prepared by the undersigned on 22 Apr 02 and\naccurately reflects the information provided during the interview.\u201d  The document bears the signature of the special agent\nwho conducted the interview with Applicant.  \n3\nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that he has consumed a pint of vodka daily since\n1966.  However, Item 11, which consists of extracts of Applicant\u2019s medical records, contains the\nfollowing statement at page 3: \u201c[Applicant] is a 48 year old . . . male, with a past history significant\nfor alcohol abuse . . . who was brought into the emergency room last evening  because he was too\n1\nweak to walk.  He has been drinking one pint of vodka a day for 35 years . . .\u201d  Item 10, a discharge\nsummary describing a subsequent hospitalization for alcohol and cocaine dependency,  states at page\n2\n2:  \u201cThe patient . . . started drinking at age 13.\u201d  Therefore, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s finding is\nbased upon substantial record evidence.\nApplicant also challenges the Judge\u2019s statements (1) that he has not taken responsibility for\nhis cocaine use and (2) that he has denied cocaine use.  This use is reflected in Item 8, Applicant\u2019s\ninterview with the Defense Security Service (DSS) investigator.   In that interview Applicant\n3\nadmitted that he had used cocaine \u201cranging from twice a week to once every other month\u201d from 1991\nuntil July 2001.  Applicant\u2019s cocaine problem is also reflected in Item 10, which states, \u201c[Applicant]\nreports having alcohol and cocaine abuse.\u201d  The Judge\u2019s statement about (1) is located in the\nConclusions section of the decision and appears to be based on the Judge\u2019s interpretation of\nApplicant Exhibit C, a memo from Applicant\u2019s AA sponsor.  In that memo, the sponsor lauds\nApplicant\u2019s efforts to remain free of alcohol: \u201c[Applicant] has developed a passion for the sober way\nof life.\u201d  The Judge noted that the statement does not reflect that Applicant\u2019s sponsor was aware of\nthe cocaine abuse, which suggests that Applicant was minimizing his cocaine problem in his\nresponse to the FORM.  \nRegarding (2), Item 11, prepared upon Applicant\u2019s admission for inpatient alcohol abuse\ntreatment, describes various social factors that bore upon Applicant\u2019s medical condition.  It states\nat page 4: \u201cNo history of illicit drug use.\u201d  It could reasonably be inferred that this statement came\nfrom  Applicant.  As the date of admission was April 24, 2001, and as Applicant has elsewhere\nacknowledged that he was a frequent user of cocaine from 1999 to 2001, the Judge could reasonably\nhave concluded that Applicant was being untruthful as to his drug activity.  The documents\nreferenced above reasonably support the Judge\u2019s observation that Applicant has not sufficiently taken\nresponsibility for his cocaine use and that he has in fact denied such use.  Accordingly, we conclude\nthat the Judge\u2019s findings are based upon substantial evidence.  Even if there was error in these\nfindings, such error would be harmless, given the record evidence as a whole.  See ISCR Case No.\n01-23362 (App. Bd. June 5, 2006); ISCR Case No. 03-09915 (App. Bd. Dec. 16, 2004); ISCR Case\nNo. 01-11192 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2002).  \n  \nApplicant also takes issue with the  Judge\u2019s decision to consider certain documents submitted\nby the government.  First, he challenges the admission of his interview with the DSS agent on the\ngrounds that it violated his right against self incrimination under the Fifth Amendment of the\nConstitution.  However, this was not a custodial interrogation within the meaning of Miranda v.\n\nApplicant\u2019s brief on appeal addresses, somewhat summarily, issues he raised in more detail in his response to\n4\nthe FORM.  We have read these documents together, therefore, in addressing the appellate issues in this case.\n4\nArizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).  Interviews in security clearance cases do not involve custodial\ninterrogations by law enforcement officers.  ISCR Case No. 94-0722 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 28, 1995).\nBecause DOHA proceedings are civil, not criminal, in nature, the procedural protections available\nto defendants in criminal proceedings are not applicable. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 96-0127 at 2\n(App. Bd. July 29, 1997); ISCR Case No. 95-0818 at 6 (App. Bd. Jan. 31, 1997).  There is no basis\nto conclude that Applicant\u2019s statement to the investigator was other than voluntary.  Accordingly,\nthe Judge did not err in considering Item 8.    \nApplicant also challenged the admission of Item 8, as well as of Items 9 - 13, on hearsay\ngrounds.  He also contends that Items 9 - 13, which are portions of his medical records, were\nadmitted in violation of the doctor patient privilege.   \n4\nThese documents\u2019 hearsay character do not impair their admissibility in this case, for they\nhad reasonable indicia of reliability or otherwise fell within exceptions to the hearsay rule.  Item 8\nwas a detailed summary of Applicant\u2019s admissions, given under circumstances in which Applicant\nwas required to cooperate and be truthful.  It was consistent with other evidence in the record, and\ncertified as true by the agent.  The medical records are a type of evidence routinely admitted in trials\nand administrative proceedings, on the view that \u201c people are motivated to tell the truth to a\nphysician who is going to diagnose or treat them.\u201d  Paul Rothstein, Federal Rules of Evidence (Third\nEdition) at 553 (2007).  The Federal Rules of Evidence serve only as a guide in DOHA hearings.\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.19.  They may be relaxed in order to allow the parties to develop a full record.  The\nDOHA process encourages Judges to err on the side of initially admitting evidence into the record\nand then to consider a party\u2019s objections when deciding what, if any, weight to give to that evidence.\nBecause DOHA proceedings are conducted before impartial, professional fact finders, there is less\nconcern about the potential prejudicial effect of specific items of evidence than there is in judicial\nproceedings conducted before a lay jury.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-11571 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Feb.\n8, 2007).  \nConcerning the alleged privileged nature of the medical documents, Item 14, a memo from\nApplicant\u2019s attorney to Department Counsel, states that Applicant \u201chas authorized me, on his behalf,\nto consent to the release of any medical information or medical treatment records deemed relevant\nand material\u201d to his case.   Therefore, any privilege or right of privacy which Applicant might\notherwise seek to invoke has been waived for purposes of this adjudication.  Accordingly, we\nconclude that, given the record in this case, the Judge did not err in admitting the documents into\nevidence.  Furthermore, the weight which she assigned to the documents was not arbitrary,\ncapricious, nor contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0619 (App. Bd. Sept. 10, 1999).  \n    \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\n\n5\nof national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive  \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d   Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish any\nappropriate mitigating conditions.  See Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions and whole-person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more\nof them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of\nsound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3\n(App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006). \nGiven the Judge\u2019s findings in this case, there is no basis to conclude that she erred in her\nanalysis of possible mitigating conditions or that her whole-person analysis was flawed.  Given the\nextent of Applicant\u2019s struggle with substance abuse, the Judge made a reasonable conclusion that\nApplicant had failed in his burden of persuasion.  This is especially true in light of Applicant\u2019s\nhaving requested an administrative determination, which deprived the Judge of an opportunity to\nevaluate the credibility of his statements in the context of a hearing.   We hold that the decision is\nnot arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  \n\n6\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.  \nSigned: Jeffrey D.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nThomas M. Abbott, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On August 31, 2006,  DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline\nJ (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On July 24, 2008, after two hearings, Administrative\nJudge Darlene Lokey Anderson denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant  filed\na timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.  On November 17, 2008, the Board\nremanded the case to the Judge for further proceedings.  Subsequently, on December 11, 2008, the\nJudge issued a new decision, again denying Applicant a security clearance.  Applicant again  filed\na timely appeal.  \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in relying on three\npost-hearing documents; whether the Judge erred in concluding that Applicant deliberately falsified\nher security clearance application (SCA); whether the Judge\u2019s credibility determination is not\nsustainable; and whether the Judge erred in her application of the pertinent mitigating conditions.1\nFinding error, we reverse.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant was born in Taiwan and\ncame to the U.S. as a student.  She married in the late 1980s.  After beginning employment, she\nneglected to renew her student visa or to obtain a work visa.  She was investigated by the\nImmigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and became the subject of a deportation hearing, on\nthe theory that her marriage was accomplished as part of a fraudulent effort to obtain U.S.\ncitizenship.  She was exonerated and subsequently became a U.S. citizen.  In the year following the\nhearing, she and her husband divorced.  She married a second time, which also led to a divorce.  In\n2001 she completed a SCA.   This document inquired as to her \u201ccurrent marital status.\u201d  Decision\n2\nat 3.  She listed her second marriage, but did not list the first.\nB.  Discussion\n\n3\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give\ndeference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \nIn light of the Board\u2019s holding set forth below, detailed examination of the evidentiary\nsufficiency of the Judge\u2019s findings is not necessary.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\n\nDepartment Counsel described it as \u201cnot the actual copy that [Applicant] herself did but as the actual complete\n3\nversion of . . . [the form] she would have done during the time when she filled out a security clearance questionnaire.\u201d\nTr. II at 5. \n \n4\nApplicant argues on appeal that the Judge erred in admitting three Government documents.\nThe documents in question are GE 4, \u201cElectronic Personnel Security Questionnaire SF86\nWorksheet;\u201d GE 5, apparently a copy of a blank electronic SF86 (SCA);  and GE 6, a reproduction\n3\nof a computer screen displaying an electronic SCA question concerning an applicant\u2019s spouse.\nApplicant argues that these documents should not have been admitted in absence of evidence that\nApplicant had actually seen them in preparing her form.\nApplicant\u2019s argument is persuasive.  We note that the question which Applicant is alleged\nto have falsified is Question 8 of her SCA.  The heading for this section is \u201cYour Spouse,\u201d and the\nquestion itself reads \u201cWhat is your current marital status?\u201d  Applicant answered \u201cDivorced,\u201d and,\nas stated above, listed only her second marriage.  The Government presented, at a re-opened hearing,\nthe three documents listed above.  GE 4 is a questionnaire, purportedly to have been used by\napplicants in preparing to fill out SCAs at the time in which Applicant completed hers.  This\nquestionnaire inquires about former spouses.  The Department Counsel admitted to the Judge he\ncould not certify that Applicant had ever used, or had even seen, this document or one like it.\n\u201cWhether she had access to the worksheet or not the government is not going to tell you she did\nbecause we have nothing saying that that was what must have happened.\u201d  Tr. II at 8.  Given this\npronouncement by Department Counsel, this document lacks probative value on the question of\nApplicant\u2019s knowledge and intent in filling out her SCA.   \nGE 5 is a photocopy, apparently consisting of a number of questions as they would appear\nto an applicant sitting at his or her computer filling out an electronic SCA.  Department Counsel\nstated that this \u201cis the version that was in place\u201d when Applicant completed hers.  Tr. II at 8.  This\ndocument inquires about an applicant\u2019s \u201ccurrent marital status,\u201d providing options such as \u201cNever\nMarried,\u201d \u201cMarried,\u201d \u201cDivorced,\u201d etc.  It also provides a space for an applicant to identify \u201cFormer\nSpouse(s).\u201d  GE 5 at 23.  While this document appears to inquire about former spouses in the plural,\nand, therefore,  would tend to contradict Applicant\u2019s claim that she did not know she had to list her\nfirst marriage, as with GE 4 there is no evidence demonstrating that Applicant had ever seen it or\nwas aware of it.  Indeed, GE 5 does not appear on its face to be totally consistent with GE 1,\nApplicant\u2019s SCA, in that GE 5 inquires about spouses in \u201cSection 13/15,\u201d whereas Applicant\u2019s SCA\naddresses this subject at Question 8.  Without evidence to demonstrate, or to permit a reasonable\ninference, that Applicant ever saw the questions displayed in GE 5, or was aware of them, the\ndocument has no probative value.  Finally, GE 6 is a printout of a computer \u201cpopup\u201d screen\npurportedly demonstrating what an applicant would see on his or her computer in answering the\nquestion at issue in this case.  As with the previous two exhibits, this one inquires about previous\nmarriages, but, again, there is no evidence that Applicant ever saw it or was aware of it.  Indeed, the\nprintout bears the name and a social security number of some person other than Applicant\u2019s former\nspouses, and it may actually have been derived from another applicant\u2019s file.  Therefore, this\n\nOf course, proffered documents not admitted, or given no weight, are still to be placed to the case file and\n4\nproperly annotated.\n5\ndocument as well lacks probative value on the question of Applicant\u2019s knowledge and intent in\nfilling out her SCA. \nUnder the facts of this case these documents have no probative value, in the absence of\nevidence linking them to Applicant.   Department Counsel\u2019s descriptions of them to the Judge\n4\nconstitute at most offers of proof, which have no evidentiary value.  See, e. g., United States v.\nBagley, 722 F.2d 482 at 489 (9  Cir. 1985) (\u201cA mere offer of proof by the defendant that he is not\nth\nthe owner or possessor of a car does not establish the fact of ownership or possession.\u201d)\nAccordingly, these documents were inadmissible.  Once admitted, it was error for the Judge to have\nconsidered them on the substantive questions arising from Applicant\u2019s answer to Question 8 of her\nSCA.   \nIn view of this conclusion, the Board must address whether the error was harmful.  We note\nthe following, drawn from the Analysis portion of the Decision: [W]ith respect to Applicant\u2019s\nsecurity clearance application . . . The instructions that accompany the security clearance application,\nthe security clearance worksheet, and a sample computer screen shot of the actual E(QUIP)\ndocument all indicate that the Applicant was consistently asked to list all former spouses.  (See\nGovernment Post-Hearing Exhibits 4, 5, and 6).  She did not.\u201d  Accordingly, the Judge found against\nApplicant under both Guidelines E and J.  The quoted language demonstrates that, in interpreting\nthe intent underlying Applicant\u2019s answer to Question 8 of her SCA, the Judge relied heavily on the\nthree challenged documents.  Therefore, the Board cannot say with a reasonable degree of certainty\nthat, had she not considered these documents, she would nevertheless have arrived at the same\ndecision.  See, e. g., ISCR Case No. 03-23829 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 27, 2007) (\u201c[E]ven if these two\nchallenged observations had not been included in the Judge\u2019s decision, it is not reasonably likely that\nthe outcome of the case would be different.\u201d)  The Judge\u2019s error, therefore, was harmful.   In view\nof this conclusion, the Board need not address the other issues raised by Applicant.  Accordingly,\nwe reverse the decision of the Judge.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is REVERSED.\n                  \nSigned: Michael Y.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Thomas M. Abbott, Attorney At Law\nMcKenna Long & Aldridge \nJuly 24, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY-ANDERSON, Darlene, Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SF 86), dated January\n19, 2001.  On August 31, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the\nApplicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative\nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an\nAdministrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on September 29, 2006, and she requested\na hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned on February 21, 2008.  A notice of hearing was originally issued on March\n11, 2008, scheduling the hearing for March 27, 2008.  On March 20, 2008, Applicant\u2019s\nattorney requested a continuance based upon good cause.  A continuance was granted,\nand a notice of hearing was re-issued on March 25, 2008, scheduling the hearing for\nApril 22, 2008.  At the hearing the Government presented three exhibits.  The Applicant\npresented eleven exhibits and testified on her own behalf.  The record was left open for\nthe submission of additional documentation, if obtainable.  \n\n All references to the transcript refer to the May 20, 2008, hearing.\n1\n2\nPursuant to the Government\u2019s request and without objection from the Applicant\u2019s\nAttorney, the record was re-opened for submission of additional documentation.  A\nsecond hearing was held on June 9, 2008.  The Government submitted three additional\nexhibits.  The Applicant submitted one additional exhibit.  The official transcript (Trs.)\nwere received on May 20, 2008 and June 18, 2008.1\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nthe testimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 49 years old and twice divorced.  She\nhas a Ph.D in Aeronautics and Astronautics.  She is employed by a defense contractor\nas a Director of Network Systems Technology and is seeking to maintain a security\nclearance in connection with her employment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because she intentionally falsified material aspects\nof her personal background during the clearance screening process.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because she has a history or pattern of criminal\nactivity that creates doubt about her judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.\nThe Applicant was born in Taiwan in 1959, and grew up in Indonesia.  She\nattended an international high school in Indonesia with many American students whose\nparents worked for embassies throughout the world.  English was the predominant\nlanguage taught at the school and a large percentage of the students were from the\nUnited States.  Being highly ambitious by nature, in 1977, at the age of seventeen, she\ncame to the United States as a student on a F-1 visa.  After obtaining her Masters\ndegree, in 1986, she met a man who was a naturalized United States citizen and a pilot.\nBeing impressed with his ability to fly, among other things, and knowing him for less\nthan a year, in 1987, they were married in a civil ceremony.  When the Applicant began\nfull time employment, she failed to renew her F-1 visa or to obtain a work visa.  Her\nlapse in renewing her visa got the attention of the Immigration and Naturalization\nService (INS).       \nIn 1988, the Applicant was investigated by the INS, and became the subject of a\ndeportation proceeding for allegedly committing a fraudulent marriage in order to obtain\na green card and United States citizenship.  She obtained legal representation and in\nFebruary 1989, she prevailed in the case, and received her green card.  In 1990, the\n\n3\nApplicant and her husband divorced.  She became a naturalized United States citizen in\nJune 1994. \n    \nThe Applicant began working for her current company or its predecessor in 1995.\nShe met her second husband at the company that same year.  They worked in the\nsame group and their relationship evolved.  They were married in 1996, and in 2000,\nthey divorced.   \nShe completed an electronic Security Clearance Application (SF-86) dated\nJanuary 19, 2001, wherein in response to question 8, which asked what is your current\nmarital status, the Applicant answered, \u201cDivorced\u201d and listed her husband from her\nsecond marriage.  She did not list her marriage to her first husband in 1987.  The\nApplicant contends that her failure to list her first marriage and divorce was totally\nunintentional and she misunderstood the question.  (Tr. p. 70).  She also states that it\nmight have also been an oversight on her part, as she had just come out of a divorce in\n2000.  (Tr. p. 71).  \nThe Electronic Personnel Security Clearance (SF-86) worksheet that was in use\nat the time the Applicant completed her application specifically requests that all\nmarriages and all divorces be listed.  Module 8 of the worksheet requests former\nspouse information, and ends with the line \u201cOther Marriages: Use the Continuation\nSheet at the end of this worksheet.\u201d  (See Government Post-Hearing Exhibit 4). \nThe instructions for the Electronic Personnel Security clearance application,\nSection 13/15 specifically requests information concerning current and former\nspouse(s), including the full name of the spouse and the date married.  (See\nGovernment Post-Hearing Exhibit 5, pp. 22-23).  \nA sample computer popup screen of the Electronic Personnel Security Clearance\nApplication version completed by the Applicant indicates that once information about a\nmarriage or divorce is inserted, in order to proceed further, the person is prompted by\nanother question, \u201cDo You Want to Enter Another Marriage?\u201d.  (See Government Post-\nHearing Exhibit 6, p. 3).  \nThe Applicant was notified in three separate documents to list her entire marriage\nhistory, and she did not do so.  It is not reasonable to assume that the Applicant did not\nunderstand the question or that she did not see the question.  (See Government Post-\nHearing Exhibit 4, p. 16 -17 and Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit L).  By only listing her\nsecond marriage and divorce, and not her first one, the Applicant failed to accurately\nanswer the question.  It appears strategic on her part that she avoided discussing her\nfirst marriage given the fact that it involved a federal litigation proceeding.  The\nApplicant knew or should have known to reveal all of her marriages and divorces,\nincluding her first marriage that was the subject of the immigration and naturalization\ndeportation hearing.  Under the circumstances, I find that the Applicant intentionally\nsought to conceal this information from the Government.   \nWith respect to the other allegations, the evidence is not as clear.  There was\nsome confusion in the record as to whether the Applicant was interviewed on May 1,\n2002 or on May 2, 2001, or on both dates, concerning her first marriage.  The Applicant\n\n4\ncontends that she does not remember being interviewed concerning her background on\nMay 2, 1001.  There is no evidence in the record to establish that this interview\noccurred.        \nDuring an interview on May 1, 2002, with an authorized investigator of the\nDepartment of Defense, the Applicant did not disclose her marriage to her first husband\nin 1987.  The Applicant admits that she was interviewed on this date, but contends that\nshe was not the subject of an interview, but that the interview concerned her ex-\nhusband who was applying for a security clearance.  (Tr. p. 86).  Without a sworn\nstatement or an investigative report of the interview there is no evidence in the record\nthat establishes that the Applicant was interviewed concerning her own security\nclearance application on this date or what questions she was specifically asked.     \nDuring a telephone interview on March 3, 2006, with an authorized investigator of\nthe Department of Defense, the Applicant was given an opportunity to correct any\nomissions on her security clearance application.  The Applicant failed to disclose her\nfirst marriage, or the charge of marriage fraud by the Immigration and Naturalization\nDepartment. The Applicant explained that during this interview she was only asked\nabout travel and nothing concerning her marriage history.  She states that she did not\nomit anything purposefully.  \n    \nIn response to interrogatories dated August 9, 2006, submitted to the Applicant\nby the Department of Defense, the Applicant was asked to list all marriages, explain the\ncircumstances of the marriage, and identify any investigative/legal/administrative\nactions.  The Government alleges that the Applicant failed to reveal that she was\ncharged with marriage fraud by the Immigration and Naturalization Department in 1988\nconcerning her first marriage.  Question 5, of the interrogatories asked, \u201cPlease explain\nthe circumstances of the marriage, e.g., explain if they were related to your desire to\nbecome a United States citizen.  The Applicant stated, \u201cI was already a U.S. citizen\nwhen I married in 2001; and I also have specialized skills with Ph.D.  \u201cCircumstance\u201d\nMarriage was for Love and Family\u201d.  We \u201chad\u201d common goals and vision for our future,\nbut unfortunately could not the resolve the differences.\u201d  (See Government Exhibit 2, p.\n2).  The Applicant\u2019s answer to the question was hyper-technical, but not complete.\nHowever, I cannot find that she intentionally falsified her answer.     \nLetters of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s professional colleagues and\nfriends, including the Senior Vice President of Engineering, Operations & Technology\nand Chief Technology Officer, the Vice President of Engineering and Information\nTechnology at her company, and a Senior Research Scientist at NASA, give glowing\nreferences and attest to her integrity, trustworthiness, efficiency, reliability and\nconscientiousness.  She is also said to be brilliant, focused and hardworking.  (See\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A, B, C and D).   \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\n\n5\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n16.(a)  Deliberate omission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used\nto conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or\nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct)\n30.  The Concern.  Criminal activity creates a doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n31.(a) a single serious crime or multiple offenses;\n31.(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted;\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\n\n6\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in dishonesty that demonstrates poor judgment or\nunreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant her a security clearance.\n\n7\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has engaged in dishonesty (Guideline E) and by doing so violated a federal\ncriminal statute (Guideline J).  The totality of this evidence indicates poor judgment,\nunreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope\nand nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with her\nsecurity clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guidelines E and J of the SOR.\nWhether the Applicant deliberately or intentionally omitted material facts\nconcerning her former spouse to an investigator of the Department of Defense during\ninterviews on May 1, 2002 or May 2, 2001, or March 3, 2006, or in her interrogatories of\nAugust 9, 2006, has not been established.  Accordingly subparagraphs 1(a), 1(c), 1(d)\nand 1(e) are found for the Applicant.    \nOn the other hand, with respect to the Applicant\u2019s security clearance application\ndated January 19, 2001, the evidence is much stronger and more troubling.  There is no\nquestion that the Applicant was not honest with the Government concerning her\nmarriage history.  The instructions that  accompany the security clearance application,\nthe security clearance worksheet, and a sample computer screen shot of the actual\nE(QIP) document, all indicate that the Applicant was consistently asked to list all former\nspouses.  (See Government Post-Hearing Exhibits 4, 5 and 6).  She did not.  By\nconcealing this information from the Government, she has also violated Title 18, United\nStates Code which is a felony.  \nUnder Guideline E, Personal Conduct, disqualifying condition 16(a), deliberate\nomission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities applies.  The Government relies heavily upon the integrity and honesty\nof clearance holders.  It is a negative factor for security clearance purposes when an\nApplicant has deliberately provided false information about material aspects of her\npersonal background.  None of the mitigating factors set forth in the Directive under\nGuidelines E apply. \nUnder Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, disqualifying conditions, 31.(a) a single\nserious crime or multiple offenses and 31.(c) allegation or admission of criminal\nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or\nconvicted apply.  None of the mitigating factors apply.  Here the Applicant concealed\nmaterial information from the Government on her security clearance application.  She\ncommitted a violation of federal law, Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001, a\nfelony.\nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\n\n8\nwhole person assessment of questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.  The question here is whether a reasonable person under the\ncircumstances  understood the questions and how to answer them accurately.  The\nApplicant is highly intelligent, and very well versed in the English language.  She has\nbeen educated at some of the most prestigious universities in the country, and has\nobtained her Doctorate Degree in Aeronautics and Astronautics as well as other\nadvanced training.  She cannot use the excuse that she did not understand the question\nor that she did not see it.  Based upon the evidence presented, I find that the Applicant\ndeliberately concealed material information from the Government concerning her first\nmarriage on her security clearance application.  By doing so, she has made a series of\npoor decisions that adversely effect her ability to obtain a security clearance.    \nThis Applicant has not demonstrated that she is trustworthy, and does not meet\nthe eligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find\nagainst the Applicant under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal\nConduct). \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing her request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the SOR.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nFor the Applicant.\n.\nParagraph 2: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n \n\n9\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Gomez, Attorney At Law\nMcKenna Long & Aldridge \nDecember 11, 2008\n______________\nDecision On Remand\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SF 86), dated January\n19, 2001 On August 31, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the\nApplicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative\nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an\nAdministrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on September 29, 2006, and she requested\na hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned on February 21, 2008.  A notice of hearing was originally issued on March\n11, 2008, scheduling the hearing for March 27, 2008.  On March 20, 2008, Applicant\u2019s\nattorney requested a continuance based upon good cause.  A continuance was granted,\nand a notice of hearing was re-issued on March 25, 2008, scheduling the hearing for\nApril 22, 2008.  At the hearing the Government presented three exhibits, referred to as\nGovernment Exhibits 1 through 3.  The Applicant presented eleven exhibits, referred to\nas Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through K.  Applicant testified on her own behalf.  Upon\n\n All references to the transcript, except as noted, refer to the May 20, 2008, hearing.\n1\n2\nagreement of the parties, the record was left open for 20 days, until May 12, 2008, for\nthe submission of additional documentation, if obtainable.  Pursuant to the\nGovernment\u2019s request and without objection from the Applicant\u2019s Attorney, the record\nwas re-opened for submission of additional documentation.  A second hearing was held\non June 9, 2008.  The Government submitted three additional exhibits, referred to as\nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits 4, 5 and 6.  Applicant\u2019s counsel objected to each of the\ndocuments and was overruled.  (June 18, 2008, Transcript (Tr.) p. 9).  The Applicant\nsubmitted one additional exhibit, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit L, that was admitted\nwithout objection.  (June 18, 2008, Tr. p. 14).  The official transcripts were received on\nMay 20, 2008 and June 18, 2008.1\nA decision in this matter was issued on July 24, 2008, denying the Applicant\u2019s\naccess to classified information.  The matter was remanded to the undersigned\nAdministrative Judge on November 17, 2008, to decide the case on the Adjudicative\nGuidelines in effect at the time of the issuance of the Statement of Reasons.  \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nthe testimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 49 years old and twice divorced.  She\nhas a Ph.D in Aeronautics and Astronautics.  She is employed by a defense contractor\nas a Director of Network Systems Technology and is seeking to maintain a security\nclearance in connection with her employment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because she intentionally falsified material aspects\nof her personal background during the clearance screening process.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because she has a history or pattern of criminal\nactivity that creates doubt about her judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.\nThe Applicant was born in Taiwan in 1959, and grew up in Indonesia.  She\nattended an international high school in Indonesia with many American students whose\nparents worked for embassies throughout the world.  English was the predominant\nlanguage taught at the school and a large percentage of the students were from the\nUnited States.  Being highly ambitious by nature, in 1977, at the age of seventeen, she\ncame to the United States as a student on a F-1 visa.  After obtaining her Masters\ndegree, in 1986, she met a man who was a naturalized United States citizen and a pilot.\nBeing impressed with his ability to fly, among other things, and knowing him for less\n\n3\nthan a year, in 1987, they were married in a civil ceremony.  When the Applicant began\nfull time employment, she failed to renew her F-1 visa or to obtain a work visa.  Her\nlapse in renewing her visa got the attention of the Immigration and Naturalization\nService (INS).       \nIn 1988, the Applicant was investigated by the INS, and became the subject of a\ndeportation proceeding for allegedly committing a fraudulent marriage in order to obtain\na green card and United States citizenship.  She obtained legal representation and in\nFebruary 1989, she prevailed in the case, and received her green card.  In 1990, the\nApplicant and her husband divorced.  She became a naturalized United States citizen in\nJune 1994. \n    \nThe Applicant began working for her current company or its predecessor in 1995.\nShe met her second husband at the company that same year.  They worked in the\nsame group and their relationship evolved.  They were married in 1996, and in 2000,\nthey divorced.   \nShe completed an electronic Security Clearance Application (SF-86) dated\nJanuary 19, 2001, wherein in response to question 8, which asked what is your current\nmarital status, the Applicant answered, \u201cDivorced\u201d and listed her husband from her\nsecond marriage.  She did not list her marriage to her first husband in 1987.  The\nApplicant contends that her failure to list her first marriage and divorce was totally\nunintentional and she misunderstood the question.  (Tr. p. 70).  She also states that it\nmight have also been an oversight on her part, as she had just come out of a divorce in\n2000.  (Tr. p. 71).  \nThe Electronic Personnel Security Clearance (SF-86) worksheet that was in use\nat the time the Applicant completed her application specifically requests that all\nmarriages and all divorces be listed.  Module 8 of the worksheet requests former\nspouse information, and ends with the line \u201cOther Marriages: Use the Continuation\nSheet at the end of this worksheet.\u201d  (See Government Exhibit 4). \nThe instructions for the Electronic Personnel Security clearance application,\nSection 13/15 specifically requests information concerning current and former\nspouse(s), including the full name of the spouse and the date married.  (See\nGovernment Exhibit 5, pp. 22-23).  \nA sample computer popup screen of the Electronic Personnel Security Clearance\nApplication version completed by the Applicant indicates that once information about a\nmarriage or divorce is inserted, in order to proceed further, the person is prompted by\nanother question, \u201cDo You Want to Enter Another Marriage?\u201d.  (See Government\nExhibit 6, p. 3).  \nThe Applicant was notified in three separate documents to list her entire marriage\nhistory, and she did not do so.  It is not reasonable to assume that the Applicant did not\nunderstand the question or that she did not see the question.  (See Government Exhibit\n4, p. 16 -17 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit L).  By only listing her second marriage and divorce,\nand not her first one, the Applicant failed to accurately answer the question.  It appears\nstrategic on her part in order to avoid discussing her first marriage, given the fact that it\n\n4\ninvolved a federal litigation proceeding.  The Applicant knew or should have known to\nreveal all of her marriages and divorces, including her first marriage that was the subject\nof the immigration and naturalization deportation hearing.  Under the circumstances, I\nfind that the Applicant intentionally sought to conceal this information from the\nGovernment.   \nWith respect to the other allegations, the evidence is not as clear.  There was\nsome confusion in the record as to whether the Applicant was interviewed on May 1,\n2002 or on May 2, 2001, or on both dates, concerning her first marriage.  The Applicant\ncontends that she does not remember being interviewed concerning her background on\nMay 2, 1001.  There is no evidence in the record to establish that this interview\noccurred.        \nDuring an interview on May 1, 2002, with an authorized investigator of the\nDepartment of Defense, the Applicant did not disclose her marriage to her first husband\nin 1987.  The Applicant admits that she was interviewed on this date, but contends that\nshe was not the subject of an interview, but that the interview concerned her ex-\nhusband who was applying for a security clearance.  (Tr. p. 86).  Without a sworn\nstatement or an investigative report of the interview there is no evidence in the record\nthat establishes that the Applicant was interviewed concerning her own security\nclearance application on this date or what questions she was specifically asked.     \nDuring a telephone interview on March 3, 2006, with an authorized investigator of\nthe Department of Defense, the Applicant was given an opportunity to correct any\nomissions on her security clearance application.  The Applicant failed to disclose her\nfirst marriage, or the charge of marriage fraud by the Immigration and Naturalization\nDepartment. The Applicant explained that during this interview she was only asked\nabout travel and nothing concerning her marriage history.  She states that she did not\nomit anything purposefully.  \n    \nIn response to interrogatories dated August 9, 2006, submitted to the Applicant\nby the Department of Defense, the Applicant was asked to list all marriages, explain the\ncircumstances of the marriage, and identify any investigative/legal/administrative\nactions.  The Government alleges that the Applicant failed to reveal that she was\ncharged with marriage fraud by the Immigration and Naturalization Department in 1988\nconcerning her first marriage.  Question 5, of the interrogatories asked, \u201cPlease explain\nthe circumstances of the marriage, e.g., explain if they were related to your desire to\nbecome a United States citizen.  The Applicant stated, \u201cI was already a U.S. citizen\nwhen I married in 2001; and I also have specialized skills with Ph.D.  \u201cCircumstance\u201d\nMarriage was for Love and Family\u201d.  We \u201chad\u201d common goals and vision for our future,\nbut unfortunately could not the resolve the differences.\u201d  (See Government Exhibit 2, p.\n2).  The Applicant\u2019s answer to the question was hyper-technical, but not complete.\nHowever, I cannot find that she intentionally falsified her answer.     \nLetters of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s professional colleagues and\nfriends, including the Senior Vice President of Engineering, Operations & Technology\nand Chief Technology Officer, the Vice President of Engineering and Information\nTechnology at her company, and a Senior Research Scientist at NASA, give glowing\nreferences and attest to her integrity, trustworthiness, efficiency, reliability and\n\n5\nconscientiousness.  She is also said to be brilliant, focused and hardworking.  (See\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A, B, C and D).   \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\nE2.A5.1.1. The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.  \nE2.A5.1.2  Conditions that could raise a security concern:\nE2.A5.1.2.2.  The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and\nmaterial facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities;\nE2.A51.2.3.  Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant\nand material matters to an investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or\nother official representative in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness\ndetermination.\nE2.A5.1.3.  Conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct)\nE2.A10.1.1.  The Concern.  A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a\nperson\u2019s judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.\nE2.A10.1.2.1.  Conditions that could raise a security concern:\nE2.A10.1.2.1.   allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged;\nE2A10.1.2.2.  a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\nE2.A10.1.3.   Conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\n\n6\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\nE2.2.1.1.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;\nE2.2.1.2.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation;\n \nE2.2.1.3.  The frequency and recency of the conduct;\nE2.2.1.4.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\nE2.2.1.5.   The voluntariness of participation;\nE2.2.1.6.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges;\nE2.2.1.7.  The motivation for the conduct;\nE2.2.1.8.   The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress;\nE2.2.1.9.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\n\n7\nclearance may be involved in dishonesty that demonstrates poor judgment or\nunreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has engaged in dishonesty (Guideline E) and by doing so violated a federal\ncriminal statute (Guideline J).  The totality of this evidence indicates poor judgment,\nunreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope\nand nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with her\nsecurity clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guidelines E and J of the SOR.\nWhether the Applicant deliberately or intentionally omitted material facts\nconcerning her former spouse to an investigator of the Department of Defense during\ninterviews on May 1, 2002, or May 2, 2001, or March 3, 2006, or in her interrogatories of\nAugust 9, 2006, has not been established.  Accordingly subparagraphs 1(a), 1(c), 1(d)\nand 1(e) are found for the Applicant.    \nOn the other hand, with respect to the Applicant\u2019s security clearance application\ndated January 19, 2001, the evidence shows that the Applicant was not honest with the\nGovernment concerning her marriage history and that she deliberately failed to reveal\nthe full truth.  The instructions that accompany the security clearance application, the\nsecurity clearance worksheet, and a sample computer screen shot of the actual (e-QIP)\ndocument, all indicate that the Applicant was consistently asked to list all former\nspouses.  (See Government Post-Hearing Exhibits 4, 5 and 6).  She did not.  By\nconcealing this information from the Government, she has also violated Title 18, United\nStates Code which is a felony.  \nUnder Guideline E, Personal Conduct, disqualifying conditions E2.A5.1.2.2.,The\ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement or similar form used to\nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities; and E2.A51.2.3., Deliberately providing false or misleading information\nconcerning relevant and material matters to an investigator, security official, competent\nmedical authority, or other official representative in connection with a personnel security\nor trustworthiness determination apply.  The Government relies heavily upon the\nintegrity and honesty of clearance holders.  It is a negative factor for security clearance\npurposes when an Applicant has deliberately provided false information about material\n\n8\naspects of her personal background.  None of the mitigating factors set forth in the\nDirective under Guideline E apply. \nUnder Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, disqualifying conditions, E2.A10.1.2.1.,\nAllegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was\nformally charged; E2A10.1.2.2., A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses apply.\nNone of the mitigating factors apply.  Here the Applicant concealed material information\nfrom the Government on her security clearance application.  She committed a violation\nof federal law, Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001, a felony.\nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.  The question here is whether a reasonable person under the\ncircumstances  understood the questions and how to answer them accurately.  The\nApplicant is highly intelligent, and very well versed in the English language.  She has\nbeen educated at some of the most prestigious universities in the country, and has\nobtained her Doctorate Degree in Aeronautics and Astronautics as well as other\nadvanced training.  She cannot use the excuse that she did not understand the question\nor that she did not see it.  Based upon the evidence presented, I find that the Applicant\ndeliberately concealed material information from the Government concerning her first\nmarriage on her security clearance application.  By doing so, she has made a series of\npoor decisions that adversely effect her ability to obtain a security clearance.    \nI have carefully considered the Applicant\u2019s testimony in this case. For the\nreasons stated at length in this decision, I do not find her to be a credible witness. This\nApplicant has not demonstrated that she is trustworthy, and does not meet the eligibility\nrequirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find against the\nApplicant under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing her request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the SOR.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nFor the Applicant.\n\n9\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nFor the Applicant.\nParagraph 2: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\n       Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

From 1997 to 1999, he worked for a chemical\nmanufacturer.  While seeking other employment, he spoke with a competitor of his employer, who\nreported Applicant as having offered proprietary information in exchange for job consideration.\nApplicant mitigated the personal conduct security concern.  Clearance is granted.\n\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended\n1\nand modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive).\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant.  On August 3, 2004, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons  (SOR)\n1\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct)\nof the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on August 19, 2004, and elected to have\na hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on February 27, 2007.  On\nApril 5, 2007, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The Government and the Applicant\nsubmitted exhibits that were admitted into evidence.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on\nApril 19, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant denied the first two allegations in the SOR, and admitted the last allegation.  The\nadmission is incorporated here as a finding of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the\nevidence in the record, and full consideration of that evidence, I make the following additional\nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is 43 years old, married and has two children.  He has a doctorate degree in\nchemistry.  When the incidents at issue arose, he was working for a small chemical company, having\nstarted on February 4, 1997, as the laboratory manager.  He worked there until September 8, 1999.\nHe did not have a security clearance then because Applicant had no need for a clearance.  He now\nworks for a defense contractor and needs a security clearance. (Tr. 13, 14; Exhibits 2, A)\nIn 1999, while working for the chemical company, Applicant became aware of a possibility\nof future layoffs because of overstaffing in the laboratory.  Also, Applicant wanted to market other\nproducts to increase company revenues, but the company president did not seem interested in taking\nthat type of marketing action.  Furthermore, Applicant was unhappy with his salary.  So he would\nbe happier working some where else, and decided to seek other employment outside of the printing\nindustry.  Attempting to build a network for job-seeking opportunities, he contacted a former\nemployee of his then employer in August 1999, a name he heard mentioned around the company.\nHe did not know that person because their employment terms did not overlap.  Before starting his\nown company, that person also had previously worked for a large company which had offices near\nApplicant\u2019s boyhood home.  Applicant was interested in finding work near his boyhood home.\nApplicant thought that person might be sympathetic to Applicant\u2019s search for a job in a larger\npublicly-owned company.  This person\u2019s company had some products in the printing industry that\nmade it a competitor of Applicant\u2019s employer.  Their discussion, during which Applicant discussed\nhis duties with the chemical company, revealed to Applicant that this person would provide him with\nlittle or no help in his job search.  After the meeting on August 7, 1999, that person notified\nApplicant\u2019s employer that Applicant had spoken to him and offered him proprietary information.\n\n4\nThere was no further contact between Applicant and that person after the August 7  meeting. (Tr.\nth\n18, 20-27, 41, 47; Exhibits 2, 3, A)\nApplicant did not offer proprietary information.  Applicant did not want to work in the\nprinting industry again.  Applicant claims he did not sign a confidentiality agreement with his\nemployer, and thought he only had a verbal confidentiality agreement.  He thought he did not have\na non-compete agreement with his employer.  When asked by the person with whom he was\ndiscussing his job search, he told that person what his understanding was of these two types of\nagreements between him and his present employer.  Applicant worked for his chemical company\nemployer only until September 1999, when the company terminated him.  Applicant was\nunemployed for two months after leaving his employer, underemployed for five more months, and\nwas on contract as an engineer for 19 months after that, until obtaining his present position with a\ndefense contractor in October 2001.  No further incidents involving Applicant and any employer\nhave occurred in the past eight years. (Tr. 18, 20-27, 30, 34, 41, 47; Exhibits 2, A)\nPrior to being terminated, Applicant\u2019s employer sued him on September 2, 1999, in state\ncourt for breach of contract, and misappropriation of trade secrets.  The employer sought monetary\ndamages, injunctive relief, attorney\u2019s fees, and other just and proper relief.  The complaint contained\nthe first page of a company confidentiality agreement, a confidentiality memorandum signed by\nApplicant on February 4, 1997, and a reaffirmation of secrecy agreement signed by Applicant on\nFebruary 4, 1997.  No evidence was taken at any hearing, nor was there any finding by the state court\nthat Applicant committed any civil wrongdoing.  The parties agreed to settle the case.  An agreed\npermanent injunction against disclosure of any confidential and proprietary business information or\ntrade secrets by Applicant to anyone was negotiated by the parties.  The judge signed the agreed\norder on December 14, 1999.  That same date the parties signed a settlement agreement and mutual\nrelease.  That agreement prevented Applicant from working for specific companies listed in the\nagreement for a two year period , and from working in the ink and screen printing industry.  The\nagreement contains other terms, conditions, and requirements.  Included as an attachment to the\nagreement is a confidentiality agreement and non-compete agreement signed by Applicant on\nFebruary 4, 1997, consisting of five pages, including the signature page.  Applicant has fully\ncomplied with this settlement agreement.  However, Applicant claims he had a verbal confidentiality\nagreement with the company owner, but did not have a non-compete agreement with the company\nwhen he started employment there.  He disputes the first four pages of the employment agreement\nattached to the settlement agreement, claiming they are not the pages of the agreement he signed on\nFebruary 4, 1997.  Applicant does not have a copy of the 1997 agreement he claims to have signed.\n(Tr. 28, 30, 31, 44, 46, 49; Exhibit B)\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information with Industry\n\n5\n\u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the\nsecurity guidelines contained in the Directive.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as\nto whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC)\nunder each guideline that must be carefully considered in making the overall common sense\ndetermination required.  \nIn evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also\nassess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  Those assessments include:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nand the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2). Because each security\ncase presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors\nexhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover,\nalthough adverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable\ndetermination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or\nrecurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the\nGuidelines.\nThe decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as\nto the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant\nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for\nissuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  All that\nis required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling\nclassified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment,\nreliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR Case No.\n00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has established\na prima facie case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to\nclassified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\n\n6\nnational security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2.  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must,\non the side of denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  See Exec. Or. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct: The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules\nand regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.\nE2.A5.1.1\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Government established in its prima facie case that Applicant contacted a corporate\ncompetitor of his employer in 1999 to seek help finding new employment.  Applicant mistakenly\nthought this competitor could help him network to find another job.  The dispute in this case is\nwhether Applicant disclosed and discussed with the competitor certain propriety chemical products\nmanufactured and sold by Applicant\u2019s employer, in violation of a confidentiality agreement\nApplicant signed when he became employed in 1997.  Applicant\u2019s credibility is a key factor in this\ncase. \nPersonal Conduct Guideline E: The Disqualifying Conditions (DC) that apply are DC 1\n(Reliable, unfavorable information provided by associates, employers, coworkers, neighbors, and\nother acquaintances. E2.A5.1.2.1), DC 4 (Personal conduct that increases an individual\u2019s\nvulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress, such as engaging in activities which, if known, may\naffect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing or render the person susceptible\nto blackmail. E2.A5.1.2.4), and DC 5 (A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, including violation\nof any written or recorded agreement made between the individual and the agency. E2.A5.1.2.5).\nApplicant\u2019s employer concluded he was attempting to violate, or actually violated, his\nconfidentiality agreement.  The employer sued him for injunctive relief to enforce the confidentiality\nand non-compete provisions of his employment contract.  That is reliable and unfavorable\ninformation under DC 1.  Applicant\u2019s professional standing within the chemical industry would be\nadversely affected and render him vulnerable to coercion, duress, or exploitation if he had disclosed\nhis employer\u2019s confidential and proprietary business information.  Lastly, Applicant would have\nengaged in dishonest activity if he violated his employment agreement.  \nThe essential question is whether Applicant did attempt to disclose confidential information\nto a competitor of his employer.  The competitor\u2019s affidavit states Applicant denied having a\nconfidentiality agreement, and that Applicant wanted \u201cfavorable consideration for a job\u201d or\n\u201cassistance with finding employment with another chemical company.\u201d  The evidence convinces me\nthat Applicant had an employment agreement from February 4, 1997, requiring confidentiality of\nproprietary information.  He also had as part of that agreement a non-compete requirement for two\nyears after leaving his employment.  I conclude Applicant merely talked to his employer\u2019s competitor\nto network in finding a new job because that person had found other jobs, started his own business,\nand had some experience in getting jobs other than working for Applicant\u2019s employer.  This person\n\n7\naccomplished the sort of job changes Applicant wanted to achieve.  Neither Applicant nor the\ncompetitor stated or suggested anything of value was given or exchanged.  I conclude the employer\noverreacted and moved to protect himself based on information the competitor gave him.  The\ncompetitor may have misunderstood Applicant\u2019s motives and actions, but the competitor was not\npresent at the hearing to be cross-examined, so I give  less weight to his affidavit than to Applicant\u2019s\npersonal testimony.  I conclude there was no personal conduct that made Applicant vulnerable to\ncoercion or exploitation, because no substantive violation of any agreement occurred.  Nor was any\nproprietary information given by Applicant.  There is no pattern of dishonesty or rule violations.\nThis incident involved job seeking and misunderstanding occurred only once, did not involve\ndishonesty or violations of agreements Applicant thought he understood to require certain actions\non his part, and has never been repeated in any form.\nEight years have now passed since the August 7, 1999, meeting between Applicant and the\ncompetitor.  Applicant complied strictly and fully with the terms of the settlement agreement.\nApplicant was unemployed or underemployed seven months after leaving his employment with the\nchemical company.  He did not find full-time employment until October 2001.  He was adversely\naffected by his attempts to network with the competitor to seek other employment.  He has little\nmotive now to lie about what occurred in 1999.  \nI find his testimony very credible, and also find that his naivete about networking probably\ncaused him most of the difficulty in this fumbled attempt to seek new employment in 1999.  He did\nnot want to continue working in the printing industry, so it is not persuasive that he would trade\nproprietary information for a job with a competitor in that same business.  In addition, it would be\ntoo obvious a conflict of interest to jump from one company to another in the same competitive field.\nApplicant is well-educated, and he could not be that impractical to draw attention to himself by\ntaking that type of action.  What motives the competitor had for making the affidavit or calling\nApplicant\u2019s employer, or for even talking to Applicant, are not known. \nThe Mitigating Condition here applicable is MC 1 (The information was unsubstantiated or\nnot pertinent to a determination of judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability. E2.A5.1.3.1).  Based on\nthe evidence at this hearing, the entire incident appears to be a misunderstanding of Applicant by the\nother person to whom he spoke in his attempt to find help in getting another job.  His expectations\nof what the competitor could do for him by giving him guidance in networking and job seeking were\nmisplaced.  He should have contacted an employment agency, or talked to a friend in the industry\ninstead of talking to a competitor to seek other employment. \nWhole Person Concept: This incident is a one-time long-ago conversation.  It has not been\nrepeated, and after what happened to Applicant will likely not be repeated.  There is nothing in his\nten year work history to indicate he is not trustworthy or not credible.  This incident was an innocent\nattempt by Applicant to network to find himself a new job, and he made a mistake in whom he spoke\nto about employment.  No information was given, and no benefit conferred.  Applicant struck me\nat the hearing as the intellectual and professorial type of person who has little or no experience in\nfinding employment outside his immediate circle of well-educated compatriots.  He does not appear\nto be the shrewd and conniving plotter bent on stealing his employer\u2019s business secrets.  Therefore,\nI conclude the \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis for Applicant.  I also conclude the personal conduct security\nconcern for Applicant. \n\n8\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact On March 30, 2007, an SOR was issued under Guideline I, Psychological Conditions. The basis of which were four mental health evaluations conducted by the Air Force in 1993, September 1999, May 2000 and February 2007. The most recent evaluation was in conjunction with a periodic update of Applicant\u2019s security clearance. In his Answer to the SOR, dated April 27, 2007, Applicant admits to the factual allegations but denies that he has a psychological condition that affects his ability to handle classified information. He also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. Applicant is a 34 year-old security information analyst with a Department of Defense contractor who seeks to maintain his security clearance. He has been with his current employer since April 2006. (Tr at 206, 208) He served on active duty in the United States Air Force from November 12, 1991, to June 29, 2000, achieving the rank of Staff Sergeant. (Gov 2) He first applied for and received a security clearance on February 11, 1993. He has held a security clearance continuously since that date. (Tr at 217, 232) He is single and has no children. History During the first quarter of 1992, while Applicant was in Technical School, a high school friend loaned Applicant a phone card to use to call home. Applicant was to reimburse his friend for any charges made on the phone card. The Air Force Office of Special Investigations contacted Applicant and inf",

Marine, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Henry M. DeWoskin, Esquire \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on October 15, \n1999. On March 30, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline I, \nPsychological Conditions, for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after \nSeptember 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn April 27, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR in writing. He formally requested \na hearing. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on June 15, 2007, and I \nreceived the case assignment on June 21, 2007. On July 6, 2007, Applicant retained \ncounsel. On August 2, 2007, Applicant\u2019s counsel requested a delay until October 22, \n2007, the basis of which was to retain and prepare expert witnesses. On August 6, \n2007, I granted the Applicant\u2019s request for a delay. That same date, DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing, scheduling the hearing on October 23, 2007.  \nJanuary 28, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nThe evening prior to the hearing, the government expert noticed that another \nperson\u2019s Minnestoa Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) was used when making \nApplicant\u2019s initial mental health evaluation due to a mix up. As a result, an updated \nevaluation using the proper MMPI was completed on October 22, 2007.    \n \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled on October 23, 2007.  Applicant\u2019s counsel \nrequested a continuance due to the last minute change in the government expert\u2019s \nevaluation which was not served on Applicant\u2019s counsel until the morning of the hearing. \nA continuance was granted for the expert testimony and Applicant\u2019s testimony. The \nparties agreed to hear the testimony of Applicant\u2019s six character witnesses on October \n23, 2007.  Applicant also offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B, which were admitted \nwithout objection.  \n \n \nThe case was continued until December 12, 2007. The government submitted \nGovernment Exhibits (Gov Ex) 1 - 11, which were admitted and called two expert \nwitnesses. Applicant submitted AE C through G, which were admitted. Applicant called \ntwo expert witnesses, and Applicant testified on his own behalf. The record was held \nopen until December 14, 2007, to allow Applicant to submit an additional document. On \nDecember 13, 2007, he submitted a three page document that was marked as AE H, \nand admitted without objection. The record closed on December 14, 2007. DOHA \nreceived the transcripts of the hearing (Tr.) on November 2, 2007, and January 10, \n2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility \nfor access to classified information is granted. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \n \n \nOn October 27, 2008, Applicant\u2019s counsel submitted a request for production of \ndocuments.  To summarize, he requested the records, interview note, raw data, answer \nsheets, computer scored output/interpretations, hand scored output/interpretations, \ngraphs, lists of the critical items generated from the MMPI-2, the Beck Anxiety \nInventory, the Beck Depression Inventory and other tests that were given to Applicant \nduring his evaluations of February 8, 2007, May 2, 2000, September 1999, and 1993. A \ntelephone conference was held on November 16, 2007.  The Government noted that \nparagraph E3.1.13 of the Directive requires Department Counsel and the Applicant to \nserve each other a copy of any pleading, proposed documentary evidence, or other \nwritten communication to be submitted to the Administrative Judge.  The Government\u2019s \nposition was they did not have to provide copies of documents that they were not \noffering in evidence.  Applicant\u2019s counsel was informed that Department Counsel is \ncorrect with regard to paragraph E3.1.13. Regardless, he is allowed to comment on the \nGovernment\u2019s inability to provide the above documents during the hearing.  Applicant \nrequested a complete copy of his Report of Investigation from the Office of Personnel \nManagement and was informed that no such document existed.  It was discovered the \nReport of Investigation was prepared by the Defense Security Service. Applicant was \nadvised to file a request for his investigative file to the Defense Security Service, and \nDepartment Counsel was told to assist the Applicant with this request by contacting the \nDefense Security Service and requesting that Applicant\u2019s request be expedited.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s counsel objected to Gov Ex  3, 4, and 7 based on hearsay, noting \nthere are conclusions with no facts to back up the basis. With respect to Gov Ex 3 and \nGov Ex 4, he objected because he was unable to cross examine the mental health \npractitioners who prepared each memorandum. He objected to Gov Ex 5 based on \nhearsay, no proper foundation. All objections were overruled. He also objected to Capt \nC.\u2019s qualifications as an expert because she was not a licensed clinical psychologist. \nShe is a doctoral candidate who has completed all requirements with the exception of \nher dissertation. I allowed her to testify as an expert based on her clinical experience \nbut informed the parties that her qualifications will be considered when considering the \nweight to give her testimony.  \n \nThe Government objected to AE A. Specifically on page one of the exhibit, she \nobjected to a hearsay reference within a character letter. The Government also objected \nto AE F, Dr. W.\u2019s report because parts of the document summarizes information that is \nalready in the record and is cumulative. Both objections were overruled.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nOn March 30, 2007, an SOR was issued under Guideline I, Psychological \nConditions. The basis of which were four mental health evaluations conducted by the \nAir Force in 1993, September 1999, May 2000 and February 2007.  The most recent \nevaluation was in conjunction with a periodic update of Applicant\u2019s security clearance. In \nhis Answer to the SOR, dated April 27, 2007, Applicant admits to the factual allegations \nbut denies that he has a psychological condition that affects his ability to handle \nclassified information. He also provided additional information to support his request for \neligibility for a security clearance.   \n \nApplicant is a 34 year-old security information analyst with a Department of \nDefense contractor who seeks to maintain his security clearance.  He has been with his \ncurrent employer since April 2006. (Tr at 206, 208)  He served on active duty in the \nUnited States Air Force from November 12, 1991, to June 29, 2000, achieving the rank \nof Staff Sergeant. (Gov 2) He first applied for and received a security clearance on \nFebruary 11, 1993.  He has held a security clearance continuously since that date. (Tr \nat 217, 232) He is single and has no children.  \n \nHistory \n \nDuring the first quarter of 1992, while Applicant was in Technical School, a high \nschool friend loaned Applicant a phone card to use to call home. Applicant was to \nreimburse his friend for any charges made on the phone card. The Air Force Office of \nSpecial Investigations contacted Applicant and informed him that the phone card was \nreported stolen by a company. Applicant was not aware that it was stolen. He contacted \nthe company and agreed to pay the company back for the charges he made on the \nphone card. He paid the company back in full. He was counseled for using poor \njudgment. (Tr at 215-216; Gov 6) \n \n\n \n4 \n \nIn 1993, Applicant was transposing numbers on computer code at work. His \nsupervisor thought that he had dyslexia. He referred Applicant to the mental health clinic \non base to be tested for dyslexia.  Applicant met with Lt Col H., a psychologist in the \nmental health clinic. Lt Col H. diagnosed him with having a Personality Disorder \u2013 Not \nOtherwise Specified. (Note : Lt Col H.\u2019s actual report is not in the record. His diagnosis \nwas referred to in the history summaries in Gov Ex 3, 4, and 7.) During this time, \nApplicant was dealing with his parents\u2019 divorce and the death of a close friend. No \nformal treatment was recommended.  He was advised to slow down at work. (Tr at 218; \nGov 6) \n \n \nThe DSM \u2013 IV defines Personality Disorder \u2013 Not Otherwise Specified as follows: \n \nThis category is for disorders of personality functioning that do not meet \nthe criteria for any specific Personality Disorder. An example is the \npresence of features of more than one specific Personality Disorder that \ndo not meet the full criteria for any one Personality Disorder (\u201cmixed \npersonality\u201d), but that together cause clinically significant distress or \nimpairment in one or more important areas of functioning (e.g., social or \noccupational). This category can also be used when the clinician judges \nthat a specific Personality Disorder that is not included in the Classification \nis appropriate. Examples include depressive personality disorder and \npassive-aggressive personality disorder. (Gov 8) \n \n  When Applicant arrived at his first duty assignment in the 1992/1993 timeframe, \nhe spent a lot of his off duty hours at the Base Youth Center. He was under the drinking \nage and was encouraged by his supervisor to attend the Youth Center in his spare time.  \nHe befriended several teenage dependents who also spent their time at the youth \ncenter. A concern was raised due to Applicant socializing with teenage dependents. (Tr \nat 21; Gov 6) There is nothing in the record indicating who raised the concern. There is \nalso nothing in the record indicating that Applicant\u2019s conduct was improper. \n \nIn 1994, Applicant invited a fellow airman, who was recently kicked out of the \ndorms, to move in with him. He had rented a house with two other airmen. His two \nroommates recently moved out the house because they got married. The airmen would \nhelp him with the rent. Unbeknownst to Applicant, the airman was under investigation by \nAFOSI for marijuana use. During the investigation, the airman claimed that Applicant \nwas his supplier. Applicant was not aware his friend used marijuana. One day, AFOSI, \nhis first sergeant, and commander arrived unannounced at his residence.  He gave \nconsent for AFOSI to search his house. No illegal substances or drug paraphernalia \nwere found. (Tr at 210; Gov 6) \n \nApplicant also consented to be interviewed by AFOSI.  During the interview, \nApplicant admitted to using marijuana one time while in high school. On this occasion, \nhe got violently ill and has not used marijuana since.  Prior to his enlistment, he told the \nAir Force recruiter about the marijuana use, and was advised by the recruiter to leave it \noff his application. No charges were brought against Applicant for using and selling \nmarijuana while on active duty. His commander decided to issue a Letter of Reprimand \n\n \n5 \n \nfor fraudulent enlistment due to Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose his pre-service marijuana \nuse. On the date of the appointment, Applicant overslept and missed the appointment. \nAs a result, he received nonjudicial punishment under Article 15, UCMJ, for failure to \ngo.  (Tr at 211; Gov 6)   \n \nOn December 12, 1997, Applicant got married.  The marriage did not last long, in \npart, due to his wife\u2019s infidelity.  On May 7, 1999, they filed for divorce. This caused \nApplicant a lot of stress. (Tr at 228; AE H)  \n \nIn early 1999, Applicant received orders for an overseas assignment.  The \nassignment required access to Sensitive Compartmented Information.  Applicant \nunderwent a security clearance background update related to the request for SCI \naccess.  He was referred to the Mental Health Clinic based on the previous 1993 \ndiagnosis of Personality Disorder \u2013 Not Otherwise Specified.  On September 29, 1999, \nhe met with Capt. G., a staff psychologist, who confirmed the prior diagnosis of \nPersonality Disorder \u2013 Not Otherwise Specified. The psychologist conducted a clinical \ninterview, medical records review, personnel records review, telephonic interviews with \nhis chain of command and consultation with the Psychological Services Division, \nNational Security Agency.  The staff psychologist\u2019s evaluation indicated that Applicant \nhad a tendency to avoid self-disclosure to avoid personal faults and emotional \nproblems; schizoid traits (socially distant, preference for solitary activities), avoidance of \nsocial situations where he might risk rejection (e.g. preference for a younger peer \ngroup), and reluctance to take responsibility for his own actions.  Capt G. noted that \nApplicant was angry when he arrived for his evaluation because he could not \nunderstand why any question was raised about his security status. (Gov 3)   \n \nCapt. G. stated in his report, \u201cAllegations of criminal behavior five years ago raise \nconcerns about continued criminality and/or incidents of poor judgment and reliability. \nHis defensiveness during the current evaluation raises concern that [Applicant] may be \nconcealing untoward behaviors.\u201d  He recommended that a background investigation be \nconducted to ascertain whether additional behavior relative to Applicant\u2019s personality \ndisorder have occurred.  He indicated that it did not preclude Applicant\u2019s PCS overseas, \nbut recommended that Applicant not assume responsibilities involving SCI access until \nhis security status has been resolved.  He did think that Applicant\u2019s diagnosis of \nPersonality Disorder \u2013 Not Otherwise Specified, was sufficient to take away his Top \nSecret clearance.  He states that a current background check into his social behavior \nand personal conduct is required before a judgment about SCI access could be \ndetermined. (Gov 3)  Applicant\u2019s commander and supervisor recommended him for a \nsecurity clearance. His supervisor described Applicant as \u201cbrash and confrontational, \nbut not disrespectful.\u201d His supervisor felt that he was suited for a position of trust. His \ncommander indicated that Applicant had matured considerably in recent years and that \nhe was not a security risk. (Gov 3 at 5) After reviewing Capt G.\u2019s report, he continued to \nrecommend that Applicant be granted SCI access. (AE G) \n \nAt some point later, Applicant\u2019s overseas assignment was cancelled and he \nreceived orders to another stateside base. (Tr at 225) Applicant was upset because he \nbelieved that the staff psychologist had recommended that his security clearance be \n\n \n6 \n \nrevoked. He also thought that the evaluation results raised questions about his integrity. \nIn particular, he believed that that staff psychologist\u2019s comments about allegations of \ncriminal behavior five years ago raised concerns regarding continued criminality were \nunjustified.  He filed an Inspector General (IG) complaint as a result. (Tr at 222-223; \nGov 6). He was unsuccessful in getting the comments removed from the report.  \n \n  After, Applicant\u2019s overseas assignment was cancelled, he believed that the Air \nForce deemed him a criminal, and that he did not have a fair shot with the Air Force.  \nHe approached his commander and requested he be discharged under the provision \ninvolving personality disorder. He did the research and realized that he could be \ndischarged with an honorable discharge.  His commander reluctantly ordered a \ncommander-directed mental health evaluation. (Tr at 229-231)  \n \nOn May 2, 2000, he was evaluated by Major K., the Chief of the Mental Health \nClinic, whose credentials are unknown. Major K. diagnosed Applicant with a Personality \nDisorder \u2013 Not Otherwise Specified. Major K. noted that Applicant expressed strong \ndistress about his 1999 mental health evaluation.  Applicant thinks the Air Force treated \nhim unfairly and has given him no route to correct the misperception that he is a \ncriminal. He felt that the positive points about his military career were not considered.  \nThe Major found the Applicant was so distressed over this problem that he wanted out \nof the military.  Major K. found that the current stress aggravated symptoms about his \npersonality disorder, resulting in behaviors of \u201csuspiciousness, obsessing over issues, \nand social withdrawal.\u201d (Gov 4)       \n \nMajor K. concluded the statement about continued criminality in Capt G.\u2019s 1999 \nreport was improper. He noted no criminal behavior was ever proven so they should not \nhave implied that there was probability of future criminality.  He notes that the concern \nabout poor judgment was appropriate.  He recommended Applicant\u2019s discharge from \nthe Air Force. (Gov 4) \n \nOn June 6, 2000, Applicant\u2019s commander recommended that he be discharged \nfrom the United States Air Force for a personality disorder in accordance with AFPD 36-\n32 and AFI 36-3208, paragraph 5.11.1.  It was alleged that Applicant\u2019s personality \ndisorder was so severe that his ability to function in a military environment was \nimpaired.  It was noted that his mental disorder was not severe enough to warrant a \nmedical board review. On June 6, 2000, Applicant responded to the discharge. He \nwaived his rights to an administrative discharge board on the condition that he receive \nno less than an Honorable discharge. (Gov 5)  On June 29, 2000, Applicant was \ndischarged from the United States Air Force with a discharge characterized as \nHonorable. (Gov 2) \n \nIn early summer 1999, Applicant learned that his grandmother had terminal \ncancer. She was the only stable element in his life. In May 2000, she passed away.  He \nwas enroute to visit her when she died. This caused him a great amount of grief and \ndistress. (Tr at 109, 158-159, 226-228) \n \n\n \n7 \n \nAfter his discharge from active duty, Applicant worked for several defense \ncontractors. (Tr at 233 \u2013 236)  He maintained his Top Secret clearance and worked with \nclassified information during this time.  He has never had a security violation. (Tr at 234-\n235)  He has been involved in a committed relationship over the past eight years. (Tr at \n238) \n \nCurrent Issues \n \n \nIn early 2007, Applicant received a package from the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) requesting permission to schedule an appointment for him with a \nmental health provider to obtain an evaluation related to his security clearance \nbackground investigation.  He agreed to the request.  DOHA sent him a letter directing \nhim to contact the base mental health facility to schedule an appointment. (Tr at 239) \n \n \nOn February 8, 2007, Applicant met with Capt C, a staff psychologist at the base \nmental health facility, for the evaluation.  Capt C. has a Master\u2019s in Clinical Psychology. \nShe is working on her doctorate in Psychology. She has three years of practicum \nexperience and a one year internship.  She will attain her doctorate when she \ncompletes her dissertation. She is not a licensed clinical psychologist. If all goes as \nplanned, she will obtain her license in the Spring 2009. (Tr at 87-90; Gov 10) \n \n \nCapt C. initially interviewed Applicant for one hour.  During the interview, she felt \nthat she was being misled but could not provide any specifics as to why other than her \nfeeling that Applicant was not entirely forthcoming as to why he was there for an \nevaluation. Specifically, because he never told her that he needed an updated security \nclearance evaluation. Capt C. arranged for Applicant to take the MMPI.  While he was \ntaking this test, she obtained documents from her mail box which explained the basis for \nthe evaluation. She had not reviewed these reports prior to the interview. After \nreviewing the documents, Capt C. concluded that Applicant\u2019s explanation of past \nincidents were not consistent with the way the incidents were described in prior reports. \n(Tr at 97-104) She testified \u201cAgain, he would just protest that some of these situations \nreally did not occur the way they were stated in the written reports.\u201d (Tr at 104)    \n \n \nIn her written report, Capt C. states that although Applicant was cooperative in \nthe evaluation process, he did, at times, provide misleading answers which suggest his \ncontinued tendency to avoid self-disclosure of personal faults, and emotional problems \nand impaired or questionable judgment as well. She claims during the initial phases of \nthe interview, he appeared reluctant to accept responsibilities for his past behaviors and \ndifficulties.  She states during the end of the assessment process, he accepted more \nresponsibility for his behaviors. (Gov 7)  \n \n \nTests administered were the MMPI-2, the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and the \nBeck Depression Inventory -2 (BDI-2). He reported no significant psychological distress. \nHis test results were in the normal range. Capt C. concludes that the clinical interview \nrevealed a positive history of poor decision making skills and social judgment.  Capt C.\u2019s \ndiagnosis under the DSM IV was Personality Disorder, Not Otherwise Specified.  She \nconcludes that past behavior has shown to be the most reliable predictor of future \n\n \n8 \n \nbehavior and that Applicant has a history of showing a defect in judgment and reliability.  \nShe concludes that his current condition could cause a significant defect in functioning, \nwhich indicates a defect in judgment, reliability, and/or stability. (Gov 7).  \n \n \nAfter her evaluation, Capt C. consulted with Maj L., her supervisor.  Maj L. is a \nstaff psychologist. He is licensed. (Tr at 20-22; Gov 9). They went over the tests \nconducted and Capt C\u2019s evaluation of Applicant. He did not interview the Applicant and \nwas not present during Applicant\u2019s evaluation. When he signed off on Applicant\u2019s \nevaluation, he was acting as Capt C.\u2019s supervisor. (Tr at 52)    \n \n \nAt hearing, Capt C. admitted that Applicant had no marked impairment. (Tr at \n115) She relied heavily on her clinical interview when making the diagnosis. She \nadmitted under cross examination that the clinical interview is subjective as opposed to \nthe other tests given which were more objective. (Tr at 122) She believes there is a \ndifferent standard when evaluating individuals who are seeking to obtain or seeking to \nmaintain a security clearance. (Tr at 126) If not for the national security issue, she would \nmake a conclusion similar to Applicant\u2019s expert. (Tr at 115) She is not aware of any \nevents, other than the events that occurred ten years ago that indicates impairment in \nhis social functioning. She is not aware of any impairment in his occupational \nfunctioning. (Tr at 129) \n \n \nShe believes that Applicant\u2019s interview raised questions about his judgment. (Tr \nat 138) However, she describes Applicant\u2019s personality disorder as being \u201cmild.\u201d She \nhas no collateral information over the last ten years of any security problems, problems \nat work, or significant problems with peers. (Tr at 140) \n \n \nMajor L. also testified during the hearing that there were no recent events which \ncontributed to Applicant\u2019s diagnosis of Personality Disorder \u2013 Not Otherwise Specified.  \nHe describes Applicant\u2019s condition as \u201cmild\u201d. (Tr at 83)  He testified that there is a \nconcern about Applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability based on past events and his \nbehavior during the interview. (Tr at 85) \n \n \nIn preparation for his security clearance hearing, Applicant consulted Mr. T., a \nclinical mental health counselor. Mr. T. has over 20 years experience assessing and \ntreating mental illness. (Tr at 154; AE C)   Mr. T. met with Applicant on September 8, \n2007.  He interviewed Applicant for approximately two and a half to three hours. He took \ndown Applicant\u2019s history in order to establish any problems that Applicant may have \nexperienced in the past or present to determine if treatment is necessary. Mr. T could \nnot find anything wrong with Applicant. He scored \u201cnormal\u2019 on both the Beck Depression \nInventory and the Beck Anxiety Inventory. He reviewed documentation pertaining to \npast issues Applicant encountered while in the military, including the diagnosis of \nPersonality Disorder, Not Otherwise Specified.  He could not find anything wrong with \nthe Applicant.  He is not a licensed clinical psychologist so he referred Applicant to Dr. \nW., a licensed clinical psychologist, for further evaluation in order to ensure that he was \nnot missing anything. (Tr at 157-166) \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nOn September 14, 2007, Applicant met with Dr. W., a clinical psychologist and \nclinical neuropsychologist. He is a Professor of Psychiatry, Professor of Neurology, and \nProfessor of Neurological Surgery at local university. He obtained his license in August \n1978, and has extensive experience in his field. (Tr at 171-174; AE E) In the past, he \nhas been retained by the federal government as an expert witness. He is currently \nfunded on a grant from the Department of Defense Polygraph Institute and the Federal \nBureau of Investigation on research pertaining to detection of deception by people. (Tr \nat 204) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s evaluation took several hours.  Initially, one of Dr. W.\u2019s technicians \nadministered the following tests: the MMPI, the Milan Clinical Inventory, and the Validity \nIndicator Profile. (Tr at 175) Afterwards, Dr. W. interviewed Applicant for several hours. \nApplicant gave him his history which included his divorce in 1999 and the death of his \ngrandmother in 2000. He notes that Applicant got the timing wrong on these two events.  \n(Tr at 175-180) He reviewed several documents, including the mental evaluations that \nwere conducted on Applicant in 1993, 1999, and 2000. (Tr at 177; Gov 3; Gov 4; AE F)  \nHe also reviewed the most recent mental evaluation of Capt C. dated October 22, 2007, \nand February 28, 2007. (Gov 7; Gov 11)  \n \n \nDr. W. reviewed the test results.  All of Applicant\u2019s test scores were within the \nnormal range. (AE F at 29-37)  He notes that there was no indication of an Axis I clinical \npersonality disorder or Axis II personality disorder.  Axis I refers to psychiatric disorders \nthat brings someone to the attention of a psychologist such as psychosis, depression, or \nbi-polar illness. Axis II refers to chronic life-long problems which include mental \nretardation or personality disorders. Dr. W.\u2019s diagnosis is that under Axis I, Applicant \nhad an adjustment disorder by history, in remission. Under Axis II, he found no \ndiagnosis. He also concludes the diagnosis of personality disorder was not justified in \nthe past. (AE F at 38)  He states:   \n \nIt is my opinion to a reasonable degree of professional, psychological or \nmedical certainty that he has no psychiatric diagnosis on Axis I or Axis II, \nnow or in the past, that reasonably would affect his ability to deal \nappropriately with classified or secret information. (AE F at 38)    \n \n \nDr W.\u2019s disagrees with the prior diagnosis of Personality Disorder \u2013 Not \nOtherwise Specified because people with personality disorders have a chronic \ncondition. They have typical and repetitive habitual problems. He did not find such \nbehaviors in Applicant. He notes that clinicians make the diagnosis of Personality \nDisorder \u2013 Not Otherwise Specified when they have not made up their mind as to an \naccurate diagnosis. (Tr at 192-193)  Dr. W. explained: \n \nWell, you need to remind somebody if there is a possibility that you have a \npersonality disorder, but they do not have enough information to make the \ndiagnosis or you clearly meet the criteria for several personality disorders. \n\u2026..Personality Disorder \u2013 Not Otherwise Specified means you do not \nknow anything. (Tr at 193) \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nIt is Dr. W.s\u2019 opinion that Applicant presently does not have any psychiatric \ndisorder of any kind.  He has no condition that would impair his reasoning, behavior, or \nself control. (Tr at 195). \n \nCharacter Witnesses \n \n   \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor and the chief of the division where Applicant works, \ntestified on his behalf. Applicant works directly for him. He has worked with Applicant on \na daily basis since April 2006. He states that Applicant is smart technically.  He likes to \ndo things right and does not like taking short cuts. He has never received any \ncomplaints about him from their customers. In fact, he has received specific requests for \nApplicant because they like his work product. In November 2006, he wrote Applicant\u2019s \nperformance appraisal.  He rated Applicant overall as outstanding. (AE B) When \nApplicant first arrived, he was not used to working on a team and underwent an \nadjustment period. At times, he would get frustrated. After a few months, he adapted.  \nApplicant is very good and what he does and can be trusted.  Applicant was the first \nemployee to pass the extremely difficult Certified Information System Security \nProfessional Exam. After he passed the test, he put together a training program to \nassist other team members when preparing for the exam.  He indicates that Applicant\u2019s \nworkplace conduct has never raised any concerns about his ability to protect classified \ninformation. (Tr at 15-46; AE A at 3) \n \n \nThe regional director of Applicant\u2019s company testified about Applicant\u2019s technical \nskills.  He states that Applicant is highly respected in the work place and well liked on \nhis team.  He is aware of the Applicant\u2019s diagnosis but does not believe he is a security \nrisk, noting that Applicant has been trustworthy and loyal. He does not believe Applicant \nis a security risk. (Tr at 47-75 AE A at 2) \n \n \nThe Vice President of Strategy and Marketing (VP) testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf.  \nHe is the senior person at the location where Applicant works. He met Applicant when \nApplicant first came to work. His office was across the hall from the office where \nApplicant worked.  The VP makes an effort to get to know his employees.  He saw \nApplicant on a daily basis until the VP\u2019s office moved approximately six months ago. He \ndescribes Applicant\u2019s reputation in the work place as \u201ca high \u2013 tech guy, type A \npersonality\u201d  He indicates that they have several Type A personalities in the work place.  \nHe states Applicant has a good reputation and does not believe that he is a security \nrisk. (Tr at 75-91; AE A at 1) \n \n \nThree of Applicant\u2019s co-workers wrote letters on his behalf attesting to his \nexcellent work ethic, his mentoring skills, and his adherence to security guidelines and \npolicies. (AE A at 6-8)   \n \n \nA friend and former co-worker of Applicant\u2019s testified.  He has known Applicant \nsince 1993 when Applicant was on active duty and he was a civilian employee. He had \ndaily interaction with Applicant from 1994 to 1995.  After that time, he saw him on a \nsocial basis. He recommended Applicant for Applicant\u2019s current job. He sees him once \nor twice a month and communicates with him via e-mail or a phone call once a week.  \n\n \n11 \n \nHe is aware of the security issues raised in Applicant\u2019s case.  He recalls two incidents \nthat were significant in Applicant\u2019s life during 1999.  They include the Applicant\u2019s divorce \nand the death of his grandmother.  After his divorce, he felt betrayed, angry, and a little \ndepressed. Based on the friend\u2019s observations, the death of his grandmother had a \nmore devastating impact on Applicant because his grandmother was special to him. It \ntook Applicant some time to recover from these events, but he is back to normal. He \ndoes not believe Applicant is a security risk. (Tr at 93-124; AE A at 4)  \n  \n \n \n  Another of Applicant\u2019s friends testified.  He and Applicant met each other in \n1997 when they were students at Airmen Leadership School. They never worked with \neach other but lived close to each other and would socialize often.  He trusts Applicant \nand would trust him with his children. He has never observed Applicant behave \nirrationally.  He recalls that Applicant got out of the Air Force because he was not happy \nwith the way the Air Force characterized him, and did not believe he had the ability to \nchange that characterization.  He thought it had to do with the cancellation of his \noverseas assignment.  He considers Applicant a close and reliable friend. (Tr at 126-\n146) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s girlfriend testified.  She met Applicant in 1999 at a friend\u2019s house.  \nShe and Applicant have lived together since the fall 2000.  She recalls that Applicant left \nthe Air Force in 2000 because he was frustrated with his job.  She recalled that his \noverseas assignment was canceled due to issues with a psychological exam, and he \nthought he was not able to go anywhere in the military. Applicant was also very upset in \n2000 when his grandmother passed away. He has never threatened her or anyone else \nin her presence. He has never been in trouble with the law as long as she has known \nhim.  She has never seen him frustrated with his post Air Force employment, aside from \nthe usual minor irritations. (Tr at 148 -167) \n \n \nDuring his active duty service, Applicant received several awards and letters of \nappreciation. (AE A at 9 - 24)  His awards and decorations include the Joint Service \nAchievement Medal (AE at 15 -16), the Air Force Achievement Medal (Third Oak Leaf \nCluster) (AE A at 17, 19 \u2013 21). On October 1, 1999, he was appointed a \nnoncommissioned officer. (AE A at 24). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \n\n \n12 \n \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n\n \n13 \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline I: Psychological Conditions is set \nout in AG & 27:       \n \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline. No negative inference \nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the \nbasis of seeking mental health counseling.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns and \nmay be disqualifying.  There are two Psychological Conditions Disqualifying Conditions \n(PC DC) that have the potential to apply in this case.  \n \n \nPC DC & 28(a) \u201cbehavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nor trustworthiness that is not covered under any other guideline, including but not limited \nto emotionally unstable, irresponsible, dysfunctional, violent, paranoid, or bizarre \nbehavior\u201d is not applicable.  Granted Applicant encountered some personal conduct and \nalleged criminal conduct issues early in his Air Force career that raised questions about \nhis judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. They include the unknowing use of a stolen \nphone card, omitting his one time marijuana use on his enlistment application, \ninvestigation for possible drug involvement, and punishment under Article 15, UCMJ, for \na violation of Article 86, failure to go. All of these allegations are more appropriately \nalleged under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, or Guideline J, Criminal Conduct.  \nApplicant mitigated the concerns raised under each of these guidelines due to the \npassage of time.  It is also noted that Applicant cooperated with AFOSI when he was \ninvestigated for alleged drug use/distribution and that no charges were ever brought, \nmost likely due to a lack of evidence implicating Applicant. The operative language in \nAG \u00b6 28(a) relative to Applicant\u2019s case is behavior that \u201c\u2026is not covered under any \nother guideline.\u201d  Aside from being somewhat defensive during his mental health \nevaluations, Applicant\u2019s behavior after 1994 did not raise issues about his individual \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, a fact that is supported by his commander and \nsupervisor during the 1999 mental health evaluation.     \n \n \nThe Government established a prima facie case under PC DC \u00b6 28(b) \u201can \nopinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the individual has a condition \nnot covered under any other guideline that may impair judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness\u201d applies with respect to Applicant\u2019s diagnosis of Personality Disorder \u2013 \nNot Otherwise Specified during the 1993, 1999 and 2000 mental health evaluations.  \nThis disqualifying condition is not raised in the 2007 evaluation conducted by Capt C.  \nbecause she is not a licensed clinical psychologist.  Granted, Maj L., her supervisor is a \nlicensed clinical psychologist and he endorsed her evaluation. However, he did not \n\n \n14 \n \nparticipate in the evaluation. He never met or interviewed the Applicant.  He endorsed \nthe mental health evaluation only in his role as Capt C.\u2019s supervisor.    \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. The following Psychological Conditions Mitigating Conditions (PC MC) apply \nto Applicant\u2019s case: \n \nPC MC \u00b6 29(c) \u201crecent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a low probability \nof recurrence or exacerbation\u201d applies.  Dr. W., a duly qualified mental health \nprofessional, conducted an evaluation on Applicant on September 14, 2007. After \nthorough testing and interviewing Applicant, his diagnosis was that Applicant currently \nhas no mental disorder.  Dr. W. has acted as an expert witness for the US government \nin the past, and currently has a grant funded by the DOD Polygraph Institute and the \nFBI. As such, I conclude that Dr. W. is an expert who is acceptable to and approved by \nthe U.S. Government.       \n \nPC MC \u00b6 29(d) \u201cthe past emotional instability was a temporary condition (e.g. one \ncaused by death, illness, or marital breakup), the situation has been resolved, and the \nindividual no longer shows indications of emotional instability.\u201d  Dr. W.\u2019s diagnosis was \nthat he was suffering from an adjustment disorder at the time of his divorce and his \ngrandmother\u2019s death.  He notes that the disorder is in remission.  Based on the record \nevidence, it appears that there were no specific indicators of emotional instability since \nApplicant separated from the Air Force. In fact, one could argue there were no \ninstances of questionable conduct raised since 1994.  Applicant\u2019s current superiors and \nco-workers have testified that Applicant is good employee whose conduct does not \nraise security concerns.  Two of his friends and his girlfriend testified that Applicant is \nemotionally stable and that their observations of his conduct raise no issues that would \nraise a concern. \n \nOne might conclude that Applicant\u2019s desire to separate from the Air Force after \nhaving his overseas assignment cancelled was a bit rash. However, when one \nconsiders the fact that the 1999 mental health evaluation implied that Applicant is likely \nto conduct criminal behavior in the future due to his past history, a reasonable person \nmight interpret this to mean that they do not have a future in the Air Force.  During this \nsame time period, Applicant divorced his wife and discovered his grandmother\u2019s \nterminal illness. In other words, he was under a significant amount of personal stress \nduring the time period that he separated from the Air Force.     \n \nPC MC \u00b6 29(e) \u201cthere is no indication of a current problem\u201d applies. There is \nnothing in the record evidence that raises issues pertaining to Applicant\u2019s psychological \ncondition and his ability to protect classified information. Capt C. claims she felt \nApplicant was not forthcoming during his initial interview, but never really provided a \nspecific incident which indicates Applicant was misleading other than he did not fully \ndisclose the reason for his visit. The results of the objective tests taken by Applicant \nindicate that he was within the normal range of functioning. Capt C.\u2019s conclusions were \n\n \n15 \n \nbased on the clinical interview, a subjective part of the test.  She notes that Applicant \nprotested the accuracy of some of the written reports.  This would not be unusual based \non the fact that most of the reports were more than seven years old.  Furthermore, \nApplicant was not the author of these reports and disagreed with the author\u2019s \nconclusions.      \n \nIn addition to the mental health evaluation conducted by the government, \nApplicant underwent evaluations with two mental health providers. He was initially \nevaluated by a licensed professional counselor, and then by a licensed clinical \npsychologist and licensed clinical neuropsychologist. Neither found anything wrong with \nApplicant during their evaluations.  Even if one were to concur with the government \nexpert\u2019s diagnosis of Personality Disorder \u2013 Not Otherwise Specified, both government \nexperts described the Applicant\u2019s personality disorder as \u201cmild.\u201d Capt C. testified at \nhearing that Applicant had \u201cno marked impairment\u201d in his social or occupational \nfunctioning.  \n \nWhole Person Factors \n \nThe testimony of Applicant\u2019s superiors and the letters of his co-workers indicate \nthat he is successful in his current job. After his discharge from the Air Force, he \ncontinued to hold a security clearance while employed with numerous Department of \nDefense contractors. He has held a security clearance for approximately 15 years with \nno security violations.  Personal conduct issues that arose earlier in his Air Force career \nare no longer apparent. Based on these the facts and the expert testimony, in particular, \nthe testimony of Dr. W., the current state of Applicant\u2019s mental health does not raise a \nconcern about his ability to protect and handle classified information.       \n \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns \narising under psychological conditions.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline I:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n16 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

ABLARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nEric H. Borgstrom, Esq. , Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant, a lead engineer with a major defense contractor born to naturalized U.S. citizens\nfrom Taiwan, mitigated security concerns of foreign influence arising from his parents-in-law and\nbrother-in-law who are citizens of Taiwan. His parents-in-law have had U.S. green cards for five\nyears. They have lived in the U.S. half of the year in five of the past six years and all of the past year\nto prepare to become U.S. citizens. Applicant is fully integrated into U.S. society and has little\ncontact or interest in the country of his parents origin. Applying the whole person analysis I conclude\nin his favor. Applicant also mitigated allegations regarding security violations in 1994 and 2000 that\nwere minor in nature and did not result in divulging of information or documents. Clearance is\ngranted. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 30, 2006, the Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry as amended and modified, and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or\nrevoked.\nIn a sworn written statement, received April 24, 2006, Applicant responded to the allegations\nset forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on February 13, 2007.\nA Notice of Hearing was issued April 11, 2007 for a hearing held on April 25, 2007. Applicant\nwaived the 15 day notice requirement. The Government introduced three exhibits and Applicant\nintroduced ten exhibits. All offered exhibits were accepted into evidence. The government requested\nthat administrative notice be taken of twelve official government documents (Exhs. I - XII). Three\n(Exhs. V, VI, and XII) were excluded from consideration upon objection of Applicant. Applicant and\nthree others testified on his behalf. The transcript was received on May 8, 2007. \nThe record was left open at the request of Applicant for 30 days for receipt of additional\nevidence. Applicant submitted additional evidence on in the form of three documents which were\nadmitted without objection into the record. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all allegations under Foreign Influence-Guideline B and Security\nViolations-Guideline K with explanatory information. Those admissions are incorporated herein as\nfindings of fact. After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration\nof the record the following additional findings of fact are made:\nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a major defense contractor working as an engineer.\nHe was born and educated in the U.S. of parents from Taiwan who were naturalized U.S. citizens.\n\n3\nHe speaks a little Mandarin, the language of his parents, but insufficiently to hold a serious\nconversation. He holds bachelor\u2019s (summa cum laude) and master\u2019s degrees in electrical engineering\nfrom two major U.S. universities. He has worked for his employer since his graduation in 1991 and\nhas held a security clearance for the past 14 years. The current application for security clearance (SF\n86) is for a ten year renewal and was filed in 1999 (Exh. 1). He was interviewed by a defense\ninvestigator in 2002 (Exh. 2). \nApplicant was married in 1994 to another student at their undergraduate university and she\nis also an engineer with the same defense contractor working for the same program. They work on\none of several subsystems of a weapons system for the Navy. His annual income is $110,000 and\ntheir combined annual income is $190,000. Each has a 401(k) valued at over $100,000. They own\ntheir own home with no mortgage which is valued at approximately $350,000. All of their assets are\nin the U.S. They have little or no cultural interest in or contact with Chinese society or history.\nApplicant and his fianc\u00e9 who became his wife traveled to Taiwan on three occasions in 1993,\n1997, and 2001 on family matters related to their courtship and birthday events for their parents. He\nadvised his company of each trip.\nApplicant\u2019s parents-in-law and a brother-in-law are citizens of of Taiwan. His father-in-law\nretired from an electric power company where he worked as an accountant. He received a lump sum\non retirement and gets nothing further from the company. His mother-in-law was a homemaker. His\nparents-in-law visited  in the U.S. with Applicant and his wife for several weeks each year during\nthe first years of their marriage. Since 2002 they have spent half of each year in the U.S. as they were\napplying for citizenship. Each has had a green card for the past five years. They have lived in the\nU.S. permanently for the past year as they prepare to take the examination for citizenship (Exhs. I\nand J). They own a condo in Taiwan and a house in the U.S. which they purchased to provide income\nfor their daughter while she was in school. The property is rented.\nApplicant\u2019s brother-in-law lives in Taiwan and works as a lineman for a telephone company\nwhich has been privatized. The government still holds a minority interest in the company with most\nof the stock held by commercial financial entities (Exh. J 2). He did mandatory two years of military\nservice in Taiwan. He visited Applicant and his wife in the U.S. once in 2006 for a sight-seeing trip.\nHe speaks very little English so Applicant and his brother-in-law have no common language. He is\nmarried with a young son. As soon as Applicant\u2019s parents-in-law become citizens they intend to\nsponsor the family to come to the U.S. (Tr. 167). \nApplicant had two security violations over the 14 years since he obtained a security clearance.\nThe first occurred in 1994 and concerned two shrink wrapped documents classified Confidential that\nhe left on his desk overnight in violation of requirements of the Department of Defense Industrial\nSecurity Manual for Safeguarding Classified Information. When they were discovered the documents\nwere still shrink wrapped. The second violation occurred in 2000 concerning two classified\ndocuments that were unaccounted for since Applicant failed to obtain receipts for them when he\nturned them in for destruction. This was in violation of the NISPOM, and he was given verbal\ncounseling and required to attend a refresher security briefing. No disclosure or leaks of information\noccurred as a result of either violation. \nA witness for Applicant at the hearing with decades of security experience with the same\n\n4\ncompany testified that these violations, on a scale of 1-10 for seriousness, would be categorized as\ncategory 2 or 3 violations (Tr. 115). Neither violation resulted in any heightened attention given to\nApplicant by his employer. He receives regular annual briefings on security issues from his company.\nHe regrets the incidents and is embarrassed about them. However, their occurrence has heightened\nhis attention to security concerns so these incidents have increased his security awareness and\nattention to security requirement. \nApplicant is highly regarded for his diligence, integrity, and excellent engineering work in\nhis job by his supervisors and colleagues who testified for him (Exhs. A-H). He has excellent work\nethic and top engineering skills. He is regarded as a key member of the engineering staff. He is\nregarded as a model citizen with a reputation for honesty and integrity. He follows the rules of the\ncompany in all matters and knows security regulations and requirements. He knows that any possible\nbreach of security requires immediate reporting to security officers.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527\nAn evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration\nof the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nDirective, \u00b6 E2.2.1. Security clearances are granted only when \u201cit is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 2. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nInitially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the\nevidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which\ndisqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.\nSee Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant\u2019s clearance. \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should\nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7\n3.1(b).\n\u201cA security risk may exist when an individual\u2019s immediate family and other persons to whom\nhe or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States\nor may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that\ncould result in the compromise of classified information.\u201d Directive, \u00b6 E2.A2.1.1. Having\nimmediate family members who are citizens of, and residing in a foreign country, may raise a\ndisqualifying security concern. Directive, \u00b6 E2.A2.1.2.1.\n\n5\nCONCLUSION\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal\nprecepts, factors and conditions above, I conclude the following with respect to all allegations set\nforth in the SOR: \nConditions under Foreign Influence Guideline B that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying include having an immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual\nhas close ties of affection or obligation, who is a citizen of, or resident in a foreign country.\n(E2.A2.1.2.1.) Based on the evidence of record, including Applicant\u2019s admissions, the Government\nestablished reasons to raise security concerns because of foreign influence. Having established such\nreasons, the Applicant had the burden to establish security suitability through evidence which refutes,\nmitigates, or extenuates the disqualification and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant a security clearance. ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).\nMitigating conditions that might be applicable to allegations relating to his family are a\ndetermination that the individuals in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to\nbe exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty\nto the persons involved and the U.S.(E2.A2.1.3.1.), and contacts and correspondence with foreign\ncitizens are casual and infrequent. (E2.A2.1.3.3.) While his relatives are not agents of a foreign\npower, by definition parents and siblings are persons with close ties of affection. The same applies\nto close family in-laws. Thus, the specific mitigating conditions are not applicable.\nConditions under Security Violations Guideline K that could raise a security concern and be\ndisqualifying include violations that are multiple or due to negligence (E2.A11.1.2.2.). Possible\nmitigating conditions that could mitigate security concerns include actions that were inadvertent\n(E2.A11.1.3.1.), were isolated or infrequent (E2.A11.1.3.2.), or demonstrate a positive attitude\ntowards discharge of security responsibilities (E2.A11.1.3.4.). In view of the time spread between\nthe two violations and the fact that the second and last one was seven years ago, both were\ninadvertent. Applicant has shown in his conduct, as stated at the hearing by himself and his\nsupervisors and colleagues, a positive attitude towards his security responsibilities and extensive\ntraining in security requirements, I conclude that all mitigating conditions are applicable.\nIn all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons\nwho have access to classified information have an overriding responsibility for the security of the\nnation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment\nof a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. The \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each\ncase must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and\napplying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.\nApplicant is a person of substance and veracity who has had a responsible position of trust\nand has done an excellent job for his company for 16 years. He provided sincere and credible\ntestimony as to his relationship with his family, his motivations, and his loyalty to the U.S. He was\n\n6\nborn in the U.S., educated in the U.S., and is totally integrated into U.S. culture. He has no cultural\ncontact with his parent\u2019s country of origin. The status of his parents-in-law in becoming U.S. citizens\nwithin months certainly lessens any likelihood of coercion or pressure from them adversely affecting\nsecurity interests. He has little contact with his brother-in-law and, because of Applicant\u2019s limited\nability to speak any of the Chinese languages, cannot converse with him. \nWhile there is evidence that Taiwan has engaged in economic and military espionage, and\nthat the PRC may use it as a source of information as stated in official documents (Exhs. IV, and XI),\nefforts of the U.S. are consistent in support of Taiwan for its democratically elected government\n(Exh. II). Applicant shows no loyalty to Taiwan or the PRC and is a competent professional who\nknows how to deal with any pressures that might be brought against him by an agent of a foreign\ngovernment.\nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality and as an integrated whole to focus on the\nwhole person of Applicant, I conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nclearance to Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are hereby\nrendered as follows:\nParagraph l Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2 Guideline K:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nAfter full consideration of all the facts and documents presented by the record in this case,\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant.

Her positive discharge of her security duties over the\npast six years is sufficient to overcome the concerns raised by her negligence in failing to ensure\ncompliance with computer accreditation requirements. She did not deliberately falsify her subject\ninterviews when she denied any prior knowledge of the employees\u2019 actions. In the absence of proof\nthat her foreign-born brothers-in-law were still foreign nationals as of her June 2005 security\nclearance application, her failure to list them does not raise personal conduct concerns. Clearance\nis granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on June 30, 2005, detailing\nthe basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline K (Security Violations) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of the adjudicative guidelines.  In a  pro se Answer of July 20, 2005,\n1\nApplicant denied the allegations with explanations and requested a hearing before a DOHA\nadministrative judge.\nOn January 31, 2007, the government moved to amend the language of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and\n1.c under Guideline K to clarify the nature of the security violations Applicant allegedly failed to\nreport (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b) and knowingly or negligently permitted to occur (\u00b6 1.c) while employed as\nfacility security officer (FSO). Under Guideline E, the government moved to amend the language\nof \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b, and 2.c to allege with specificity the bases for the false statements Applicant allegedly\nmade in August 2002 (\u00b6 2.a), September 2002 (\u00b6 2.b),  and January 2003 (\u00b6 2.c),  and to add two new\nsubparagraphs, \u00b6 2.d (alleging that Applicant falsified a June 2005 security clearance application by\nnot listing foreign relatives), and \u00b6 2.e (cross-alleging the Guideline K conduct under Guideline E).\nThe case was assigned to me on February 2, 2007, with the motion pending. On February 9, 2007,\nI ordered Applicant to respond by March 1, 2007, or the SOR would be amended as proposed and\nthe allegations admitted. On February 15, 2007, Applicant indicated through counsel that she had\nno objections to the motion to amend.\nPursuant to notice dated February 26, 2007, I convened a hearing on April 25, 2007, to\ndetermine whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant. The SOR was amended as proposed by the government, and Applicant\nadmitted her responsibility for the security violations in the amended SOR. The government\u2019s case\nconsisted of 22 exhibits and the testimonies of three government investigators who interviewed\nApplicant and a Defense Security Service (DSS) industrial security representative. Applicant and\nthree witnesses testified on her behalf. A transcript of the hearing was received on May 7, 2007.\n\nIn the original SOR, the government had alleged failure to report a security incident involving the use of an\n2\nunaccredited laptop to process classified information on board submarines at a naval base in January 2001. In the\namended SOR, the government focused on the alleged violations that occurred offsite at a defense contractor facility in\nJanuary 2001.\n3\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nDOHA alleged under Guideline K, as amended, that Applicant as FSO: (1) in or about January\n2001 failed to report that a computer hard drive marked classified and a laptop circuit board for an\nunaccredited laptop had been used by a company employee offsite at another defense contractor\u2019s\nfacility to process SECRET information, in violation of \u00b6\u00b6 1-200, 1-201, 1-300, 1-303, 1-304, 5-100,\nand Chapter 8 of the National Industrial Security Manual for Operating Information (NISPOM) and\n\u00a7\u00a7 III.1, III.2, and V of the company\u2019s standard practices procedures manual (SPP) (\u00b6 1.a) ; (2) in or\n2\nabout March and April 2001 failed to report that a computer hard drive marked classified and a laptop\ncircuit board for an unaccredited laptop had been used to process SECRET information by a company\nemployee at the same offsite location on two occasions in addition to that alleged in \u00b61.a, in violation\nof \u00b6\u00b6 1-200, 1-201, 1-300, 1-303, 1-304, 5-100, and Chapter 8 of the NISPOM and \u00a7\u00a7 III.1, III.2, and\nV of the SPP (\u00b61.b); and (3) in or about March and April 2001 knowingly or negligently permitted\nSECRET information to be processed on two occasions on an unaccredited laptop computer system\nowned or under the operational control of company employees while outside of the company facility,\nin violation of \u00b6 5-100 and Chapter 8 of the NISPOM and \u00a7 X of the SPP (\u00b6 1.c).\nDOHA alleged under Guideline E, as amended, that Applicant falsified material facts:  (1) in\nan August 7, 2002, statement by denying she had any prior knowledge that classified information was\nused on unclassified computers (\u00b6 2.a); (2) during a September 2002 interview by denying she had\nany prior knowledge of the use of unclassified laptop computers to process classified information and\ndenying she had sent out an unaccredited laptop for classified use at a defense contractor facility (\u00b6\n2.b); (3) during a January 28, 2003, interview by denying that she had allowed or given permission\nfor any company employee to use an unaccredited computer system to process classified information\n(\u00b6 2.c); and (4) on a June 2005 security clearance application (SF 86) by not listing her two foreign\nnational brothers-in-law (\u00b6 2.d). In addition, the security violations alleged under Guideline K were\ncross-alleged under Guideline E (\u00b6 2.e).\nIn her Answer of July 20, 2005, Applicant explained as to \u00b6 1.b that in late January 2001, she\nhad received a package containing a hard drive and circuit board, both classified SECRET. Told they\nwere used in a laptop owned by the Navy but operated by employees of her company at another\ndefense contractor\u2019s facility, she indicated the Navy temporarily accredited the equipment so it could\nbe used during a critical project pending DSS accreditation. In a supplemental response, she indicated\nthat the hard drive and circuit board were not returned to the other company until they had been\ntemporarily accredited by the Navy. Applicant denied knowingly or negligently permitting employees\nof her company to process classified information on unaccredited laptops. Applicant also denied\nintentional falsification of her August 2002 statement or September 2002 and January 2003 interviews\nwith an authorized investigator. In response to the amended allegations, Applicant admitted that as\nFSO, she was responsible for the violations since they occurred on her watch (Tr. 11-12). After\nconsideration of the pleadings, exhibits, and hearing transcript, I make the following findings of fact.\n\nOnly Applicant and the President of the company were listed as key management personnel (Owner, Officer,\n3\nDirector, Executive Personnel, \u201cOODEP\u201d). Pursuant to \u00b6 2-104 of the NISPOM, the senior management official and the\nfacility FSO must always be cleared to the level of the facility clearance. Other officials, as determined by the cognizant\nsecurity authority, must be granted a personnel security clearance or excluded from classified access.\n4\nApplicant is a 49-year-old FSO, who started her career as a civilian clerk-typist for the U.S.\nNavy in June 1976. She was first granted a SECRET clearance in late July 1976. In April 1978, she\nbecame a branch secretary for the Navy, and in July 1978 married her first husband. In August 1984,\nApplicant had her first child, a daughter. Two years later, she was divorced. Applicant supported\nherself and her daughter by working as a division/branch secretary at the naval base. As a division\nsecretary, Applicant was in charge of the classified safes in the office.\nIn April 1988, Applicant married her second husband. He adopted her daughter from her first\nmarriage, and they had two daughters who were born in November 1990 and November 1995. In June\n1991, Applicant left her job at the naval base. She had been out on maternity leave and requested an\nadditional month of unpaid leave so that she could remain with her husband, who was working for\nthe Navy out of state and not scheduled to return until July 1991. She resigned when the leave was\nnot granted as she could not afford to maintain a household, work full-time, and raise her two\ndaughters on her own. After about three months unemployed, she took a position with a very small\ndefense contracting firm. In addition to her administrative duties, she was given the job of facility\nsecurity officer (FSO) responsible for personnel and facility security compliance at the workplace.\nHer SECRET clearance was renewed in March 1992. In early July 1995, a few months before the\nbirth of her third daughter, she was laid off. In about February 1996, she was diagnosed with cancer,\nand was unable to work for about a year while undergoing treatment.\nIn late February 1997, Applicant returned to work. In mid-May 1997, she resumed her duties\nas FSO for her previous employer. She was granted a SECRET clearance in early June 1997.\nIn mid-April 1999, Applicant began working for her present employer (company X) in human\nresources and as the FSO. To fulfill her duties as FSO, Applicant had to be cleared to the level of the\ncompany\u2019s clearance.  The facility was cleared to the level of TOP SECRET (SECRET for storage\n3\ncapability) on August 15, 1996. Applicant completed a security clearance application (SF 86) on April\n29, 1999. She listed her seven siblings (two brothers and five sisters) on her application (Your\nRelatives and Associates), but did not include two brothers-in-law who had been born in Spain.\nApplicant was granted her TOP SECRET clearance in mid-May 2000.\nAs company X\u2019s FSO, Applicant was responsible for supervising and directing the security\nmeasures necessary for implementing the Department of Defense\u2019s requirements for classified\ninformation as set forth in the NISPOM, and in the company\u2019s Standard Practices and Procedures\n(SPP) manual, which provided specific security guidance to cleared employees within the facility as\nrequired by NISPOM \u00b6\u00b6 1-201 and 1-202. Applicant\u2019s duties as FSO included coordinating the use\nof company computers for classified work and ensuring that company employees with clearances\n(about 130 as of August 2002) were educated about and adhered to their security responsibilities.\nThe DSS industrial security specialist (ISS) assigned to monitor and assist company X\u2019s\nsecurity compliance visited the facility in June 2000 and found five security issues that needed\ncorrection, including some problems with the computer systems approved for classified processing.\n\nThe classified material transmittal document (Ex. 8) signed by Applicant on January 12, 2001, indicates that\n4\nit was sent to her attention at company X. Her signature appears on the classified material transmittal document. She told\na DSS polygraph examiner that employee #1 delivered the classified package to her office (Exs. 15 and 16), and that the\ncompany X employee who had used the laptop informed her of its contents before she opened it (Ex. 15). At the hearing,\nshe testified that it brought, still wrapped, to her office by employee #1 (Tr. 150).\nThis security incident was the subject of \u00b6 1.a in the original SOR issued on June 30, 2005. DOHA amended\n5\nthe SOR, in part, to focus on the use of an unaccredited laptop to process classified information at the facility that was\nthe subject of \u00b6 1.b in the June 2005 SOR and now \u00b61.a and \u00b6 1.b. The use of the laptop on the submarine is nonetheless\nrelevant to assessing the security posture of the facility and Applicant\u2019s knowledge of security practices as the FSO.\nAt the hearing, the ISS testified that the DSS \u201cgenerally has responsibility for such accreditation within\n6\nindustry. Within the Government, Government activities have their own authorization to approve certain automated\ninformation systems to process classified information.\u201d (Tr. 64).\n5\nSteps were taken to have an employee with technical knowledge of computer systems adequately\ntrained in automated information systems security. In December 2000, a non-accredited automated\ninformation system (AIS) was used to process classified information and CONFIDENTIAL\ninformation was sent unencrypted over the Internet.\nOn January 9, 2001, a laptop computer, which had been used by company X personnel\n(employee #1) to process classified information on board a Navy submarine, was sent via registered\nmail to Applicant\u2019s attention.  The package was wrapped and marked SECRET. On her receipt on\n4\nJanuary 12, 2001, she was advised by employee #1 that the package contained a laptop with hard\ndrive that had been used by him in a classified environment. Aware it would violate security to\nprocess classified information on a company X laptop that had not been accredited by the DSS, she\nopened the package and asked him if it was accredited, i.e., approved by DSS for processing of\nclassified information. Applicant informed employee #1 that the laptop had to be approved ahead of\ntime to process classified information. Employee #1 assured her that he had a technical change\nproposal document from the Navy that allowed the laptop to be connected to a classified system on\nthe submarine where he was working for company X. After logging it into the classified\naccountability system and storing it in an approved container, she notified the DSS industrial security\nspecialist (ISS) with cognizance over the facility.  The ISS advised her that if company X owned the\n5\nlaptop, an AIS security plan would need to be generated and accreditation requested from DSS, but\nthat the Navy was responsible for the laptop accreditation if it belonged to the Navy.6\nApplicant learned that the computer belonged to the Navy. She kept the laptop with hard drive\nin an approved GSA container at her facility until it was again needed on the submarine. On\nassurances from employee #1 that he had sanitized the hard drive, and on belief that an interim\naccreditation had been granted by the Navy for use of the laptop to process classified information on\nthe submarine, Applicant allowed employee #1 to again use the laptop in late February 2001 to\nprocess classified information on the submarine without obtaining accreditation from DSS. She did\nnot pursue accreditation because it was a government-owned (Navy) laptop. Applicant informed the\nISS on February 26, 2001, that the laptop would be sent directly from the submarine to the Navy after\nits use where it would then be declassified according to Navy regulation. After the laptop was\nreturned in its unclassified state, company X would begin the 30-day accreditation process. The ISS\napproved of the process proposed, and requested that once the company regained custody of the\nlaptop, company X send in the accreditation package as well as certification of the declassification.\n\nThere is conflicting evidence as to whether the laptop was owned by the Navy but used by company X\n7\npersonnel (see Answer) or owned by the company (see Ex. 15).\nApplicant told a DSS polygraph examiner that the hard drive and circuit board had been transferred back and\n8\nforth during the March to April 2001 time frame (Ex. 16), and that she learned in May 2001 that the hard drive had been\nused in a laptop owned by company X for the processing of classified information (Ex. 16). She testified at her hearing\nthat it was in late January 2001 when the hard drive came back into the facility that she investigated and determined that\nthe laptop belonged to company X so it would have to be accredited. (Tr. 169-70)\nApplicant testified on direct examination that when she first received the SECRET hard drive from company\n9\nY, she assumed it was a piece of test equipment and properly stored it. (Tr. 154) The evidence is conflicting as to how\nand when Applicant realized the hard drive was not a piece of test equipment (See Tr. 160, 166-74, 188-190), but it was\nnot shown that she ever sent out a laptop from company X to company Y knowing that it would be used to process\nclassified information at company Y. \nThe AIS security plan was not included in the hearing record, and it cannot be determined from the record\n10\nwhat laptop(s) this AIS concerned. In a letter of April 17, 2001, to company X\u2019s president, the ISS indicated he received\nan AIS security plan pertaining to the laptop used at company Y, with no mention that the laptop had been previously\nused to process classified information. (Ex. 12) The inference is that Applicant sought to accredit a computer she knew\nhad been used at company Y to process classified information, a post hoc effort at rectification. In a letter of April 10,\n2001, to DISCO, the ISS indicated company X\u2019s vice president went to the Navy to obtain approval to accredit the laptop\nused at company Y. (Ex. 11) The vice president did not confirm that he had contacted the Navy with respect to the laptop\nused at company Y (Tr. 216-17), which apparently was a company and not government-owned laptop. \n6\nThe Navy subsequently declassified the hard drive and Applicant sent verification of that\ndeclassification to the ISS.\nOn January 24 and 25, 2001, a company X employee (employee #2), who was cleared to at\nleast the SECRET level, connected an unaccredited laptop  to a SECRET AIS at another defense\n7\ncontractor facility (company Y) (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Company X was a prime contractor on the contract.\nEmployee #2 was told by a company Y employee that it was not a problem as long as the computer\nhard drive was treated as SECRET following the testing. At the conclusion of the classified testing,\nthe hard drive and circuit board were removed, marked SECRET and appropriately wrapped, and sent\nback to company X via registered mail to the attention of employee #2. The laptop itself was hand\ncarried. On receipt of the classified shipment on January 26, 2001, Applicant opened it and discovered\nit contained a laptop hard drive and circuit board, both marked SECRET. Applicant notified employee\n#2 of the receipt, logged both items into company X\u2019s classified accountability records, and secured\nthem. Applicant originally thought it was test equipment and did not realize that they had been used\nin the laptop. The classified hard drive and circuit board were transmitted back and forth on at least\ntwo additional occasions between companies X and Y so that employee #2 and his coworkers could\nuse them at company Y.  Applicant assumed they were being used properly at company Y and she\n8\ndid not question company X employees as to how they were being used and she did not inform the\nISS.9\nOn February 16, 2001, the ISS received from Applicant an AIS security plan dealing with a\nlaptop.  On March 2, 2001, the security plan was returned to company X with a number of required\n10\ncorrections.\nOn March 12, 2001, the ISS met with the Navy to ask about accreditation of the laptop used\nto process classified information on the submarine in January 2001. During the onsite visit, the ISS\nlearned a second laptop had been used to process classified information by company X employees at\n\n7\ncompany Y in January 2001. Applicant was informed by the ISS  in an email of March 13, 2001, that\npending his completion of an administrative inquiry of the use of the two laptops, he needed the\nparticulars of the use of the laptop at company Y (location, dates and names of employees, classified\nsystem, contract number, measures taken to protect the laptop and transmit to company X). In\nresponse on March 26, 2001, Applicant indicated that the classified hard drive had been removed\nfrom the laptop, transmitted via registered mail from company X, and stored in an approved container\nsince it was received. A DSS investigation revealed that the laptop had been connected to an AIS\napproved to process SECRET information for testing on January 24 and 25, 2001, at company Y, with\nthe classified sessions lasting six or seven hours in each instance. In an email message of March 28,\n2001, the DSS representative with security cognizance over facility Y concluded that initial\nindications were that no compromise had occurred, but that company Y had been asked to conduct\nan inquiry. Company Y questioned the need for reaccreditation as the proper procedures had been\nfollowed, and it was similar to adding new workstations to the AIS which did not require\nreaccreditation.\nOn April 10, 2001, the ISS  filed with DISCO an adverse information report under \u00b6 1-304\nof the NISPOM, assessing Applicant as responsible for two security violations involving the use of\nunapproved laptops to process SECRET information at company Y and on a naval submarine. The\nISS indicated that Applicant had \u201cample knowledge of AIS security requirements through formal\ninstruction, years of experience as well as past and present oversight of DSS accredited AIS systems.\u201d\nHe opined that Applicant \u201cwas aware that both laptops were operating in a classified mode, left the\nfacility on three occasions for classified use, and were returned twice as SECRET hardware.\n[Applicant] allowed the use of the laptops to continue, failed to stop it, or report the violations.\u201d In\na letter of April 17, 2001, the ISS alerted company X\u2019s president of what he saw as the overall\ndeclining security posture at the facility. He characterized the processing of classified information on\nan unaccredited laptop by an employee at company Y in January 2001 as disturbing. While he could\nnot determine the knowledge Applicant had before the processing, he indicated she should have been\nalerted to the problem on receipt of the marked hard drive in late January and she did not mention to\nhim that it had been used to process classified when she submitted an AIS security plan on February\n16, 2001. He commented that the recent violations demonstrated \u201can ongoing lack of knowledge on\nthe part of [company X\u2019s] employees as well as [the FSO].\u201d \nSometime in 2001, a human resource employee was hired, and Applicant assumed full-time\nresponsibility for security at the facility. In her capacity as FSO, Applicant continued to be responsible\nfor personnel and facility compliance with security regulations, and was the point of contact within\nthe company for the assigned DSS representative. In January 2002, a new DSS ISS assumed security\ncognizance over company X.\nOn August 7, 2002, Applicant was interviewed by a DSS special agent about her knowledge\nof the use of two unaccredited laptops to process SECRET information. Applicant provided a sworn\nstatement in which she admitted she had a detailed knowledge of the DSS standards for AIS\naccreditation, but she denied any prior knowledge that classified information had been processed on\nunclassified computers. She indicated that on receipt of the hard drive properly wrapped and shipped\nfrom company Y, she notified the employee involved that it was an unauthorized use of the computer,\nand contacted the DSS for advice on how to deal with the situation, that within days she had\nsubmitted security plans for company X AIS systems, and had initiated accreditation of the\n\n8\ncomputers. Applicant indicated that she had thereafter taken greater control of all computers utilized\nto process classified information, and provided necessary education to company X employees.\nOn September 3, 2002, the DSS ISS was interviewed about the administrative inquiry at\ncompany X in 2001 and the finding that no compromise had occurred. No longer the assigned DSS\nrepresentative for the facility, he could not recall the actions taken to accredit the laptops at issue. He\nexpressed his belief that Applicant did not deliberately allow the violations, but may have been\nsomewhat incompetent with regard to the incidents.\nDuring a subsequent interview with a DSS agent on September 5, 2002, Applicant again\ndenied any knowledge of the use of the unclassified laptops while it was taking place, and she denied\nshe ever sent out an unaccredited laptop from company X for classified use. She explained she had\nsent the hard drive back to company Y on two occasions on company Y\u2019s request but had never sent\nout the laptop.\nOn January 28, 2003, Applicant was interviewed by a DSS special agent/polygraph examiner\nin conjunction with a scheduled polygraph examination. During the pretest interview, Applicant\ndenied she ever knowingly allowed or gave permission for any employee at company X to use any\nunclassified or unapproved (unaccredited) computer system to process classified information.\nApplicant explained that while the same laptop had been taken back to the submarine and used to\nprocess classified information, the Navy had provided paperwork showing the accreditation. As for\nthe use of a second laptop at company Y, Applicant related she properly logged and stored the\nclassified hard drive and circuit board received from company Y, and that between March and April\n2001, the same classified hard drive and circuit board were transmitted back and forth between\ncompany X and company Y so that employee #2 and his cleared coworkers could use them at\ncompany Y (\u00b6 1.b). Applicant said she assumed the computer components were being used for\nprocessing classified information because they were both marked as classified, but she did not\nquestion anyone.  Applicant indicated that she learned in May 2001 from employee #2 that the same\nhard drive was being used in a laptop owned by company X at company Y for the processing of\nclassified information, and she did not allow that hard drive to return to company Y until the laptop\nwas accredited by the DSS. During a post-test interview, Applicant acknowledged she had allowed\nthe security violations to occur in that she made assumptions and failed to ask the required questions\nabout the classified hard drive and circuit board. She indicated it was never her intent to allow\nclassified information to be processed on an unapproved system and she never gave verbal permission\nto do so. Applicant attributed the security problems in 2001 to her being responsible for both FSO and\nhuman resource duties at that time. She denied falsifying any information during previous interviews\nwith the ISS or DSS special agent.\nTo renew her TOP SECRET clearance, Applicant executed a security clearance application\n(SF 86) on June 27, 2005. Divorced from her second husband in December 2004, Applicant filed the\napplication under her maiden name. Applicant listed her parents, three daughters, and seven siblings\non her SF 86. While two of her brothers-in-law were foreign-born, she did not include them in\nresponse to question 9, \u201cYour Relatives and Associates.\u201d She did not  think to list them since they\nhad lived in the U.S. for many years and are in the U.S. legally.\nOn June 30, 2005, DOHA issued the original SOR to Applicant under her married name.\nWhile her request for hearing was pending, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator\n\n9\nfor the Department of Defense on September 14, 2006. Asked about her foreign-born brothers-in-law,\nand her failure to list them on her SF 86, Applicant explained she did not realize she was required to\nlist them on her clearance application. She was uncertain of their citizenship status, whether they had\nbecome U.S. citizens by naturalization or were citizens of their native Spain, but knew they had\nacquired permanent residency status in the U.S. Asked about the DSS ISS\u2019 allegations that she had\nknown about security violations and allowed them to continue, Applicant indicated that the ISS was\nconfusing two incidents, one that did not involve any company X personnel. Concerning the\nprocessing of classified information on board the submarine, she explained that as soon as she learned\nthat employee #1 had used an unaccredited laptop to process classified information on the submarine,\nshe called the ISS to determine what steps should be taken. She then discussed a second incident\ninvolving storage by company X of company Y hard drives; that in the process of investigating the\nclassified items in company X\u2019s possession, the ISS found some of company Y\u2019s hard drives that had\nnot been certified were found to contain classified information. (Ex. 21) It is not clear whether\nApplicant was discussing another security incident or the use of the laptop at company Y. Applicant\ndenied that she made any knowingly false statements to government investigators.\nAs of late April 2007, Applicant was the information security officer as well as FSO for\ncompany X. An information technology professional was the information security manager with\nparticular oversight over AIS at the facility. Continuation of Applicant\u2019s TOP SECRET security\nclearance is supported by upper management at the company. She has shown herself to be dependable\nand conscientious with regard to fulfilling her security responsibilities. Under her watch, the company\nhas not failed any security inspections. Minor deficiencies have been corrected on the spot. Applicant\nhas been more diligent in her efforts to acquire security expertise in the past six years.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nThe President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for\naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960). An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue [her] security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3\n(App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\nThe adjudicative guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the\nadministrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.\nThe decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met\nthe strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance. \n\nIn his letter to company X\u2019s president of April 17, 2001, the ISS indicated Applicant had \u201cample knowledge\n11\nof AIS security requirements through formal instruction, years of experience as well as past and present oversight of DSS\naccredited systems.\u201d However, he also indicated that the more recent security violations involving the laptops\n\u201cdemonstrates an ongoing lack of knowledge on the part of [company X] employees as well as your Facility Security\nOfficer.\u201d (Ex. 12).\n10\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline K, noncompliance with security regulations raises doubt about an\nindividual\u2019s trustworthiness, willingness, and ability to safeguard classified information. (Directive\n\u00b6 E2.A11.1.1).  Applicant has a duty as a cleared individual to safeguard classified information under\nher custody or in her control (NISPOM \u00b6\u00b6 1-200, 1-500; SPP \u00a7 II), and to report adverse information\nthat comes to her attention involving any loss, compromise, or suspected compromise of classified\ninformation, or concerning any cleared (or in the process of being cleared) employee which indicates\nsuch access or determination may not clearly be consistent with the national interest (NISPOM \u00b6\u00b6 1-\n302a, 1-303; SPP \u00a7 III.1). Furthermore, by virtue of her position as FSO, Applicant is responsible for\nsupervising and directing security measures necessary for implementing the requirements of the\nNISPOM and her employer\u2019s SPP (\u00b6 1-201 NISPOM). Specific duties include educating employees\nabout the government\u2019s information security program, advising them of the requirements for\ndisclosure of classified information and contractual obligations involving classified access, informing\nthem of the adverse impact on national security that could result from unauthorized disclosure,\ninstructing them  about the procedures for handling classified material, providing employees with the\nparticular security requirements applicable to their jobs, alerting them about counterintelligence\nissues, and informing them of their reporting obligations (SPP \u00a7 II.1). Any failure of an FSO to\ncomply with security regulations necessarily raises questions about the appropriateness of continued\naccess for the cleared facility as well as for the FSO.\nApplicant did not know before January 12, 2001, that employee #1 had used an unaccredited\nlaptop on board the naval submarine, and she acted appropriately in reporting the violation to the ISS.\nWhile the ISS subsequently concluded that Applicant violated security requirements when she\npermitted employee #1 to use the laptop to process classified information on the submarine a second\ntime without first obtaining proper accreditation (Ex. 11), the evidence shows that Applicant\nunderstood from the ISS that it was the Navy\u2019s responsibility to accredit the laptop since it was owned\nby the government. In late February 2001, Applicant notified the ISS that the employees involved\nwith the laptop would have it sent directly to the Navy and not company X on its return from the ship,\nand the laptop would be declassified according to Navy regulations before being sent back to the\ncompany. The ISS responded, \u201cWhat you have described works for me.\u201d (Ex. 7) Applicant knew from\nher AIS training that a company X laptop had to be accredited by DSS before any classified\nprocessing. NISPOM \u00b6 8-102 specifies that the cognizant security agency (DSS in the case of\ncompany X) is the designated accredited/approving authority responsible for accrediting information\nsystems used to process classified information in industry. Yet, laptops were also new in the facility.\nEven DSS representatives had questions about AIS accreditation and what was required at that time\n(see Ex. 7). When questioned in September 2002 about the violations, the ISS indicated that\nApplicant \u201cmay have been somewhat incompetent with regard to the incidents.\u201d (Ex. 6).11\nHowever, the circumstances surrounding the use of the laptop at company Y and Applicant\u2019s\nknowledge (what she knew and when she knew it) raise concerns under Guideline K, disqualifying\ncondition \u00b6 E2.A11.1.2.2, Violations that are deliberate or multiple or due to negligence, and general\n\nSee Directive \u00b6 E2.15.1.1, conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of\n12\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly\nsafeguard classified information.\n11\nconcerns under Guideline E, \u00b6 E2.A5.1.1, Conduct involving questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules\nand regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.\nApplicant has repeatedly maintained throughout several interviews that she did not give permission\nto employee #2 to process classified information at company Y on an unaccredited laptop. While\nApplicant told a DSS polygraph examiner in January 2003 that she had \u201cknowingly allowed classified\ninformation to be processed on [a] computer system that was not accredited by DSS\u201d (Ex. 14), she\ndid not admit to prior knowledge or approval of the improper use of the laptop; rather, she admitted\nshe failed as FSO to ensure that the hard drive and circuit board transmitted between company X and\ncompany Y were being used appropriately by company X personnel at company Y. Aware that\ncompany X employees were working on a project at company Y involving a classified circuit board\nand hard drive, Applicant was negligent in not inquiring into the circumstances of their use. While\nthere is conflicting evidence as to when she confirmed with employee #2 that he had used an\nunaccredited company X-owned laptop, once she learned of the security violation, she had an\nobligation to report it to DSS under NISPOM \u00b6\u00b6 1-302.a and 1-304 and SPP \u00a7 III. Although she\ncontends she contacted DSS as soon as employee #2 confirmed he had used the unaccredited laptop,\nthe available evidence indicates the ISS learned of the improper use of the laptop at company Y on\nMarch 12, 2001, from the Navy during his investigation of the use of the other laptop on the\nsubmarine. She did not provide any document to corroborate her claim of notification.\n The success of the industrial security program within a given defense contractor facility\ndepends on the FSO upholding his or her fiduciary duty. The demands of two positions (human\nresources and security) cannot justify any failure to report a known or suspected violation. However,\nGuideline K mitigating conditions \u00b6 E2.A11.1.3.2, violations were isolated or infrequent, and \u00b6\nE2.A11.1.3.4, demonstrate a positive attitude towards the discharge of security responsibilities,\napply. Due at least in part to the delay (unexplained) in the adjudication of this case, it has been six\nyears since the laptop was used at company Y. Deficiencies in the facility\u2019s security posture between\nDecember 2000 and April 2001 have been corrected. With the hiring in 2001 of another employee\nto take over Applicant\u2019s human resource duties, she has been able to devote her full attention to\nsecurity with positive results. The company has not failed any inspections. Minor deficiencies have\nbeen corrected on the spot. While company X\u2019s upper management has a stake in ensuring that\nApplicant retains her TOP SECRET clearance, the corporate officers are not likely to have falsely\nattested to Applicant\u2019s diligence with regard to her own security education.\nApplicant\u2019s increased competency in understanding and implementing security requirements\nnotwithstanding, the government must be assured that her representations can be relied on, and with\nregard to fulfilling her security responsibilities, that she will timely report any security violation or\nadverse information about a cleared employee that comes to her attention. Any evidence of intentional\nfalsification would necessarily raise serious doubts about her judgment and reliability under Guideline\nE,  and about her willingness to comply with her obligations under the NISPOM, including reporting\n12\nrequirements. The government contends Applicant made several false statements by claiming in\nAugust 2002, September 2002, and in a pre-polygraph interview of January 2003,  that she had no\nprior knowledge of unaccredited computers being utilized to download classified data. Submitted as\n\n12\nproof of her falsification was Applicant\u2019s sworn statement of January 28, 2003, in which she indicated\nwith respect to the use of the laptop at company Y:\nIn about Feb 01, I received a classified package from [company Y]. . . . I opened it\nand saw that it contained a hard drive classified as SECRET and a circuit board\nclassified as SECRET. . . . Between Mar 01 and Apr 01, this classified hard drive\nand circuit board were transmitted back and forth between [company Y and\ncompany X] so [employee #2] and his cleared coworkers could use them at the\n[company Y] facility. Each time they were properly wrapped and marked in keeping\nwith DSS regulations. I assumed at the time that the hard drive and circuit board\nwere being used properly at [company Y] so did not question anyone. I did not\nreport this to DSS at the time, and I did not ask [company Y] officials, [employee\n#2] or any of our [company X] employees specifically how they were using the hard\ndrive and circuit board.\nIn May 01, I found out through a conversation with [employee #2] that this same\nclassified hard drive was being used in a laptop owned by [company X] at [company\nY] for the processing of classified information. At that time, I called [the ISS] and\ntold him what happened. I did not allow that hard drive to go back to [company Y]\nuntil the [company X] laptop was accredited by DSS. By Jul 01, [company X] had\nthis laptop and another one accredited by DSS. I now realize that by making the\nabove assumptions and not asking all the questions about this classified hard drive\nand circuit board, I did knowingly allow classified information to be processed\non [a] computer system that was not approved by DSS. . . . It was never my\nintent to disregard any security regulation or to commit any security violations. (Ex.\n15, emphasis added).\nApplicant also indicated in that same statement, \u201cI now realize, however, that because of my title of\nFSO, I was responsible for the security violations because the ultimate security responsibility for my\nfacility falls on me. I do not like the fact that I am being investigated for this security violation when\nit was committed by another cleared [company X] employee.\u201d (Ex. 15)\nThere is no evidence that Applicant knew employee #2 had used his laptop to process\nclassified information at company Y during the week of January 22, 2001, when it was going on.\nAlthough she transmitted the circuit board and hard drive back to company Y at least twice on\nemployee #2's request, the government did not prove that she returned a laptop with express or tacit\npermission to use it to process or download classified information. It was reasonable of her to assume\nthat employee #2, who had at least a SECRET clearance, would fulfill his security responsibilities.\nCompany Y did not see any problem with the procedure, as the equipment was logged in, and\nproperly declassified when they finished. (Ex. 7) While this does not eliminate the need for company\nX to accredit the computer beforehand, it suggests that any violation of security was not deliberate\nbut due to inadequate knowledge of security requirements. Employee #2 may not have realized that\nit was a violation, as employee #1 did not understand that the temporary change document was\ninsufficient to accredit the laptop he used. Applicant\u2019s recognition, albeit in hindsight and with some\nreluctance, that she is responsible for the violations of employees at her facility, is not tantamount to\nan admission that she knew beforehand and approved of the improper use of a laptop. Based on the\n\n13\nevidence before me, I conclude Applicant did not deliberately falsify her statement and interviews as\nalleged in \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b, and 2.c.\nNor did the government prove a knowing falsification of her June 2005 security clearance\napplication. Applicant does not dispute that she failed to list on her June 2005 SF 86 the two brothers-\nin-law who were born in Spain. The government bases its case for Guideline E DC \u00b6 E2.A5.1.2.2, The\ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts on any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations,\ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities, solely on the fact of foreign birth\nof these two relatives. Assuming the instructions for completing the EPSQ version of the SF 86 (Ex.\n20) are the same as the Questionnaire for National Security Positions (Ex. 22), Applicant would have\nbeen required to report those \u201cforeign national\u201d relatives or associates to whom she is bound by\naffection, obligation, or close and continuing contact. Applicant readily admitted to an investigator\nin September 2006 that two of her sisters are married to former professional Jai-Alai players born in\nSpain. However, she also indicated that she was not certain whether her brothers-in-law were still\ncitizens of Spain or had become U.S. citizens by naturalization. Their citizenship status was not\nsufficiently clarified at the hearing to permit the threshold finding that they were foreign nationals as\nof her execution of the June 2005 security clearance application. If they acquired U.S. citizenship and\ndid not possess dual citizenship, they would not be foreign nationals as a matter of law.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR, as amended:\nParagraph 1. Guideline K:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nJeremiah Donovan, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On August 5, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis\nfor that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E\n\n2\n(Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On June 29, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative\nJudge Elizabeth M. Matchinski denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely\nappealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law, because the Judge failed to find that Applicant\u2019s conduct was\nmitigated.\nThe Judge made the following relevant findings of fact:  Applicant used marijuana with\nvarying frequency from 1971 until at least 1994.  Applicant was convicted of conspiracy to distribute\nillegal drugs in about 1974.  Applicant sold marijuana for profit to a coworker while working for a\ndefense contractor and holding a security clearance.  In 1994, Applicant was convicted of selling\nillegal drugs.  When Applicant completed a security clearance application (SF 86) in 2002, he listed\nhis 1994 drug conviction, but not the one in 1974.  \n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d  Dorfmont v.

Once the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish mitigation.\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  In this case, Applicant admitted most of the conduct.  With regard to the\nfalsification if his SF 86, Applicant testified that he did not include his 1974 conviction because he\nthought it did not have to be listed because he believed it came under the Federal Controlled\nSubstances Act exception to the question and had been expunged.  The Judge was not required, as\na matter of law, to accept Applicant\u2019s testimony.  Rather, the Judge had to consider Applicant\u2019s\nstatements in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0005 at 3 (App.\nBd. Apr. 19, 2000).\nMoreover, the application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply\non a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 01-14740 at 7 (Jan. 15, 2003).  In this case, the Judge found some mitigation due to the passage\nof time since the conduct at issue.  However, that did not compel the Judge to make a favorable\nsecurity clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge had to weigh the evidence as a whole and\ndecide whether the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable, or vice versa.  Applicant\u2019s\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different\ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or\nreached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 06-17691 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 19, 2007).   \nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct.  The Judge considered the possible application of relevant\nmitigating conditions and discussed why she did not apply them in Applicant\u2019s case.  The Judge\nexplained why the evidence Applicant submitted in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence\ncited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2005).  \n\n3\nIn his brief, Applicant points out that he has been a dutiful employee for many years, has\nnever been accused of using marijuana on the job or allowing marijuana to affect his job\nperformance, and has not used marijuana since 1994.  The government need not wait until an\napplicant actually mishandles classified information before it can deny or revoke access to such\ninformation.  See Adams v. Laird, 420 F. 2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S.\n1039 (1970).  An applicant with good or exemplary job performance may engage in conduct that has\nnegative security implications.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10950 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2007).\nThe Directive\u2019s Guidelines set forth a variety of examples of off-duty conduct and circumstances\nwhich are of security significance.  Id.\nGiven the record that was before her, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision\nunder Guidelines J and E is sustainable.  \n\n4\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.             \nSigned: Michael Y.

In May 1975, he was convicted\nof distribution of a controlled substance. Applicant sold marijuana for profit to another defense\ncontractor employee  for about nine months from about July 1993 until April 1994, when he was\narrested and convicted of selling illegal drugs. He did not accurately disclose his criminal drug\ninvolvement when he completed his security clearance application in 2002. His evidence in\nmitigation falls short of overcoming the very serious Criminal Conduct and Personal Conduct\nconcerns. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \u00b6 E3.1.2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on August 5, 2005,\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)\nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct). With the assistance of an attorney, Applicant answered the\nSOR on August 22, 2005, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was\nassigned to me on December 28, 2005.\nOn January 9, 2006, I scheduled a hearing for February 10, 2006. An amended notice was\nissued on January 13, 2006, rescheduling the matter for March 1, 2006, at Applicant\u2019s request due\nto his unavailability. On March 1, 2006, Applicant appeared pro se, as he had discharged his attorney\nthe previous day, and he requested a continuance to obtain new legal counsel more familiar with the\nlaws of the jurisdiction of his arrest in 1974. I granted a continuance over the Government\u2019s\nobjection.  On April 24, 2006, I rescheduled the hearing for May 18, 2006.\nOn May 17, 2006, the hearing was cancelled verbally because Applicant had been separated\nfrom his employment with the defense contractor on April 28, 2006. Applicant was rehired by the\nsame defense contractor in late September or early October 2006, and his case was reopened. On\nMarch 13, 2007, the case was assigned to DOHA Administrative Judge Charles Ablard to conduct\na hearing on the original SOR  The case was transferred to me on March 26, 2007, due to workload\nconsiderations. On April 4, 2007, I scheduled a hearing for April 27, 2007.\nAt the hearing on April 27, 2007, counsel for Applicant entered his appearance. The\nGovernment submitted nine exhibits (Ex. 1-9). Applicant testified on his behalf and submitted two\nexhibits (Ex. A-B). A transcript (Tr.) of the proceedings was received on May 11, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nDOHA alleged under Guideline J that Applicant was convicted of conspiracy to distribute\nillegal drugs in about 1974 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); felony sale of a controlled dangerous substance in 1994 (\u00b6\n1.b); and violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 by failing to disclose his 1974 offense on his security\nclearance application (SF 86) (\u00b6 1.c). Under Guideline E, Applicant allegedly sold marijuana for\n\nDOHA alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a that Applicant was convicted of conspiracy to distribute illegal drugs, apparently\n1\nbased on Applicant\u2019s admission to a Defense Security Service agent on December 2, 2003, that he had been charged with\na \u201cvariety of charges (specifics not recalled) related to drugs with the primary charge being conspiracy to distribute illegal\ndrugs.\u201d (Ex. 5).According to Superior Court records, Applicant was convicted of distribution of a controlled substance\n(E), in violation of Chapter 94, Section 32. In May 2006, an associate justice of the court certified the offense was a\nmisdemeanor. (Ex. A).\nApplicant testified on direct examination that his decision to plead guilty was influenced, in part, by the judge\n2\ntelling him that the offense would be expunged or sealed. (Tr. 43-44) There is no proof that the offense was expunged,\nand as shown by Exhibit A, his conviction is still on record of the Superior Court. Applicant testified that he understood\nthe state to have unsealed records \u201cin order to find out if people were trying to get guns.\u201d (Tr. 44) Applicant never\nreceived an order of expungement. (Tr. 67)\n3\nprofit to a coworker for nine months in about 1994 while employed by a defense contractor and\nholding a CONFIDENTIAL clearance (\u00b6 2.a) and deliberately falsified his July 2002 SF 86 by not\nreporting his 1974 drug offense. In his Answer, Applicant admitted the criminal drug offenses and\nsales to a coworker (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 2.a).  He denied intentional falsification of his SF 86 (\u00b6 2.b),\nasserting he believed the record of his 1974 offense had been expunged. \nAfter consideration of the pleadings, exhibits, and hearing transcript, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 51-year-old designer who began working for his current employer, a defense\ncontractor, in March 1980. He was laid off in late April 2006, but returned to the company in about\nlate September or early October. He requires a SECRET security clearance for his duties.\nApplicant began smoking marijuana as a teenager in 1971. Over the next 23 years, his\ninvolvement with the drug varied from times of no or little use to use three to four times per week.\nOn occasion, he sold marijuana to friends at cost. While still in high school, he tried hallucinogenic\nmushrooms once. He also experimented with cocaine years ago.\nOn his graduation from high school in 1974, Applicant got a job for about six months as a\nmason tender with a contractor that his sister had hired to construct her new home. He stayed in the\narea thereafter, working in restaurants, and at odd jobs whenever he could. After work hours, he\ndrank beer and played pool with other tradesmen at a local lounge. One night, Applicant was asked\nwhether he had any amphetamines by someone who had several times expressed interest in his sister.\nApplicant claims he told this person he did not use amphetamines and to ask someone else. He\ndenies he named anyone specifically (\u201cI told him go to talk to someone else. I made no reference to\nanyone specifically.\u201d Tr. 38), but he was subsequently arrested on charges relating to aiding and\nabetting a drug sale that he denies knowing took place. Applicant pleaded guilty to a charge of\ndistribution of a controlled substance in May 1975,  and he was sentenced to one year probation and\n1\n$250 court costs.  Applicant was discharged from probation in May 1976.  He contends that he only\n2\npleaded guilty because of the prohibitive costs of contesting the charge at trial.\nFollowing his arrest, Applicant moved to his current state of residence where, over the next\nfew years, he worked as a waiter, longshoreman, and night watchman. Seeking a position with his\npresent employer, Applicant was told by an interviewer that experience in the steel trade would\nincrease his chances of being hired. Applicant worked for about nine months at a sheet metal shop\n\nApplicant admitted \u00b6 2.a, that he sold marijuana for profit to a coworker for nine months while he held a\n3\nCONFIDENTIAL clearance issued on October 12, 1989. Yet, Applicant testified that he never held other than the \u201cgreen\nbadge\u201d which meant a company-granted CONFIDENTIAL clearance until after September 11, 2001. It now means an\ninterim SECRET clearance. (Tr. 58). The government presented no documentation showing the grant of a DoD\nCONFIDENTIAL clearance.\nAsked on cross examination to confirm that he sold the marijuana to make money, Applicant responded, \u201cA\n4\nsmall amount. And I also had you know it was basically somebody asking me and I would get it for them you know.\u201d\n(Tr. 80). He had at least $8,000 in drug proceeds in his apartment when it was searched in April 1994, which cannot\nreasonably be characterized as a small amount.\n4\nbut was laid off. In March 1980, he started with his present employer (defense contractor X) as a\nsheet metal mechanic. He was given a company-granted CONFIDENTIAL security clearance.3\nApplicant continued to smoke marijuana during off-duty hours, knowing that it was illegal and that\nhe was violating his employer\u2019s policy against drug use.\nIn about  July 1993, Applicant worked part-time as a bartender in addition to his work for\ndefense contractor X. After an acquaintance from this part-time job told him that he could obtain\nmarijuana, Applicant decided he could make about $100 by procuring marijuana for a coworker at\ncompany X. On at least 10 to 15 occasions over the next nine months, Applicant acted as a\nmiddleman, buying marijuana and then selling it to this coworker, in quantity of one pound,\nsometimes more. He purchased the marijuana in one pound increments for $1,400 to $1,600 and sold\nit to this coworker for $2,000 to $2,400 per pound. On at least one occasion, he sold this coworker\ntwo pounds of the drug. Applicant sold the marijuana knowing that it was illegal to do so, as he\ncould make a significant amount of profit on the transactions.  He assumed this coworker was selling\n4\nthe marijuana to others, although he made no effort to confirm it. Applicant claims he gave no\nthought to his involvement in the drug transactions being inconsistent with him holding a clearance.\nThis coworker subsequently ran into legal trouble, and Applicant believes he cooperated with\npolice to apprehend Applicant for his drug sales. On or about April 4, 1994, this coworker asked\nApplicant for some marijuana. Applicant stopped at a local delicatessen on his way to work when\nhe saw the coworker\u2019s vehicle, and he was arrested for having one pound of marijuana in his\npossession. While he was under arrest, the police executed two search and seizure warrants for the\nresidence of Applicant and his then girlfriend. The police found marijuana, packaging material, a\nscale, and approximately $13,000 in cash (about $8,000 from drug sales), in Applicant\u2019s apartment.\nApplicant was charged with possession of marijuana with intent to sell, possession of more than four\nounces of marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia, and sale of a controlled substance within\n1500 feet of a school. Applicant did not provide the police with the identity of his supplier. He felt\n\u201cput upon\u201d and told them he would not \u201ctattletale on [his] fellow union members.\u201d (Tr. 96) In\nJanuary 1995, Applicant was convicted of sale of a controlled substance, a felony. The court\nsentenced him to serve six years confinement, suspended, and three years probation with conditions;\nto perform 200 hours of community service; to pay $3,000 to a drug awareness education program;\nand to undergo a drug evaluation and complete a drug counseling program, if required. \nTo avoid a possible layoff, in 1996 or 1997 Applicant  transferred to the design department,\nwhich provided him access to more detailed information than just the finished drawing or plan that\nhe had worked with previously. The position required a SECRET security clearance. Applicant\n\nThree iterations of the security clearance application were admitted: an  EPSQ Version 2.2 dated June 28, 2002,\n5\nand signed July 25, 2002 (Ex. 1); an SF 86 dated September 3, 2002, bearing no signature but indicating Applicant\nsigned the form on July 25, 2002 (Ex. 2); and an SF 86 dated July 26, 2002, also with no handwritten signature but again\nnoting that Applicant signed the form on July 25, 2002 (Ex. 3). All contain the same responses to questions 21, 24, and\n28.\n5\nexecuted a security clearance application (SF 86) on July 25, 2002.  He responded \u201cYES\u201d to question\n5\n21:\nHave you ever been charged with or convicted of any felony offense? (Include those\nunder the Uniform Code of Military Justice.) For this item, report information\nregardless of whether the record in your case has been \u201csealed\u201d or otherwise stricken\nfrom the record. The single exception to this requirement is for certain convictions\nunder the Federal Controlled Substances Act for which the court issued an\nexpungement order under the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607.\n He indicated that he had been fined, ordered to perform community service, and placed on two years\nprobation for an April 1994 possession of marijuana offense. Applicant provided the same\ninformation in answer to question 24:\nHave you ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or\ndrugs? For this item, report information regardless of whether the record in your case\nhas been \u2018sealed\u2019 or otherwise stricken from the record. The single exception to this\nrequirement is for certain convictions under the Federal Controlled Substances Act\nfor which the court issued an expungement order under the authority of 21 U.S.C.\n844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607. \nHe did not disclose his 1974 distribution of a controlled substance offense in response to question\n24. He claims it was because he had been told by the judge that it was going to be expunged and he\nthought it fell within the enumerated exception, even though he never received a formal notice of\nexpungement. \nApplicant answered \u201cNO\u201d to question 28, \u201cHave you EVER illegally used a controlled\nsubstance while employed as a law enforcement officer, prosecutor, or courtroom official; while\npossessing a security clearance; or while in a position directly and immediately affecting public\nsafety?\u201d Applicant explained he did not  list his past involvement with marijuana because he feared\nit would negatively affect his clearance.\nOn December 2, 2003, Applicant was interviewed by a Defense Security Service (DSS)\nspecial agent. Applicant admitted to the agent that he had used marijuana from \u201cabout age 16 (1971)\nand continuing through 1994 (age 37),\u201d at times three to four times weekly, with other periods of\n\u201clittle or no use whatsoever.\u201d Applicant described experimental use of cocaine once \u201cyears ago\u201d and\nhallucinogenic mushrooms in high school. He indicated that he had been arrested at age 18 on drug\ncharges, including conspiracy to distribute an illegal drug, and convicted of one or two charges (not\nspecified), but denied any culpability (\u201cI did absolutely nothing wrong . . . The undercover individual\nasked me to sell him drugs. I told him to go see someone else in the bar without identifying who he\nshould see.\u201d Ex. 3). Applicant averred that he had the case expunged after two years of probation so\n\nApplicant did not specify the document from which he omitted the information. It is presumed to be his SF 86\n6\nin light of all the evidence of record.\n6\nhe did not list it.  As for his arrest in 1994, Applicant indicated he had \u201cacted as a middleman,\u201d\n6\nselling quantities of one to two pounds of marijuana to a coworker for about nine months. Applicant\naverred that at the time of his arrest, he had $13,000 in his apartment, but that only about $8,000\nwere drug proceeds. He denied any other sales for profit, but admitted he had sold to friends in the\npast at cost.\nApplicant was reinterviewed on December 10, 2003, concerning his failure to disclose on his\nsecurity clearance application all of the drug charges that had been filed against him or his use of\nillegal drugs. As for his sales of marijuana, Applicant averred he sold the coworker about a pound\nper week, sometimes two pounds, purchased at between $1,400 and $1,600 per pound, and sold at\nbetween $2,000 and $2,400 per pound. Applicant indicated he had not listed the conspiracy charge\nbecause it had been expunged, and he listed only the 1994 felony possession of marijuana as the\ncourt found him guilty of only that charge. He admitted he had not disclosed his use of marijuana\nbecause he was \u201cconcerned that the information would reflect bad [sic] on [him] and have negative\nconsequences.\u201d\n  \nWhen asked at his hearing about his marijuana use, Applicant testified, \u201cIt would have been\nmarijuana. It was quite a while ago even before the arrest. Just recreationally, on the weekends,\nperhaps in the evenings, maybe one marijuana cigarette.\u201d (Tr. 51) Applicant denied any use of\nmarijuana since his arrest in 1994, and any intent to use an illegal drug in the future, and the\ngovernment presented no evidence to rebut that.\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor for several years, up to and including 2006, found Applicant to be \u201ca\ngood employee, always dependable, responsive and willing to pitch with a helping hand.\u201d He is\nrespected by his group members.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nThe President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for\naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec.

Dec. 19, 2002).\nThe Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 provides in part:\n7\n(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the\nexecutive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States, knowingly and\nwillfully: (1) falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact; (2) makes\nany materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation; or (3) makes or uses any false\nwriting or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent\nstatement or entry; shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.\n7\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication\nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts, including\nthe adjudicative guidelines, I conclude the following with respect to Guidelines J and  E:\nThe security concern under Guideline J is that a history or pattern of criminal activity creates\ndoubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. Directive \u00b6 E2.A10.1.1. Applicant\nadmitted to a long history of drug offenses. He acknowledged that he possessed and used marijuana\nfor many years, and distributed marijuana\u2013each instance is a criminal offense and potentially\ndisqualifying under this guideline, even if it did not result in a conviction. He also admitted that for\nabout nine months ending in April 1994, he sold large quantities of marijuana to a coworker for large\nprofits, resulting in a felony conviction. With regard to the May 1975 misdemeanor conviction for\ndistribution of a controlled substance, Applicant denies engaging in criminal conduct and maintains\nhe pled guilty only to avoid the expense and risk of litigation and receive the benefits of a plea\nbargain. However, considering all the circumstances, including Applicant\u2019s guilty plea, his history\nof drug involvement, his willingness to engage in drug sales, and his general lack of credibility\n(discussed infra), I find the evidence of this conviction sufficient to raise security concerns. His drug\ncrimes fall within Guideline J disqualifying conditions (DC) \u00b6 E2.A10.1.2.1, Allegations or\nadmissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, and \u00b6\nE2.A10.1.2.2, A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\nThe Government submits Applicant deliberately omitted his conviction for distribution of\na controlled substance in about 1974 from his SF 86, and thereby violated \u00a7 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.7\nApplicant does not deny he omitted the offense, but claims he believed it was exempt from\ndisclosure under the enumerated exemption for drug crimes that had been expunged. As specified\nin the language of question 24, the lone exception to mandatory disclosure is for those convictions\nunder the Federal Controlled Substances Act for which the court issued an expungement order under\nthe authority of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844 or 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3607. Expungement by a state court pursuant to a\nstate law would not fall within the exception, although a good faith mistaken reliance on such an\nexpungement order could negate the willful intent required for a 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 violation.\nThe file contains no expungement order or evidence proving  the record had ever been sealed.\nWhile the 1974 charge was not reported by the FBI (Ex. 6), the court record noting his conviction\n(Ex. A) does not substantiate expungement. An associate justice of the superior court annotated the\n\n8\nrecord in May 2006 to indicate that the offense was a misdemeanor. Telling in its absence is any\nnotation by the judge that the record had been expunged or previously sealed. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s\ntestimony about the expungement does not make sense. When asked on direct examination whether\nhis decision to plead guilty was influenced by anything that the judge said, Applicant responded:\nThe judge mentioned to me that I seemed like a nice kid, I\u2019d completed everything\nproperly. He was going to do me a favor and expunge this from my record. I never\never had to put this on any job applications after that. (Tr. 43)\nThe court records show Applicant was sentenced to probation after he changed his plea to guilty. His\ndecision to change his plea could not have been influenced by a promise to expunge the offense\nbased on his compliance with a sentence that had not yet been imposed. Moreover, had Applicant\nbeen acting in good faith when he completed his SF 86, he would not have responded falsely to\nquestion 28 concerning any use of drugs while possessing a security clearance, or inaccurately\nreported the charges filed against him in 1994 and the sentence imposed for his drug sales. Even\nthough Applicant put the government on notice that he had been culpable of possession of marijuana\nin 1994, the government would have had no basis to know from his security clearance application\nthat he continued to smoke marijuana after a drug arrest in 1974 until he was arrested in April 1994,\nat times up to three or four times weekly, or that he sold large quantities of the drug for profit to a\ncoworker at company X, which led to his arrest, not only on possession charges but also for sale of\nnarcotic within 1500 feet of a school, possession of drug paraphernalia, and possession of marijuana\nwith intent to sell. The order of probation indicates he was convicted of \u201csale (vice possession) of\ncontrolled substance\u201d and sentenced to six years in prison, albeit fully suspended, in addition to\nprobation.\nApplicant\u2019s false response to question 28 has not been alleged, so it cannot provide the basis\nfor denial of his clearance under Appeal Board precedent (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 94-1159, App.\nBd. Dec. 4, 1995). Yet, it is still relevant to assessing his intent when he completed his SF 86 and\nhis credibility generally. It is not disputed that Applicant recalled the 1975 conviction when he\ncompleted his SF 86. He was no longer a 18-year-old first offender deserving of a \u201csecond chance\u201d\nbut a convicted drug felon who had violated the drug laws for some 20 years. When faced with the\ndrug arrest inquiry, he made no effort to check with the court to determine whether he was legally\njustified in not reporting his first drug conviction, even though he had never received an\nexpungement order, and the single exception from reporting is where the court issued an\nexpungement order under the authority of two specific federal statutes, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844 or 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 3607.  He has failed to persuade me that his omission of the 1975 conviction was due to good faith\nmisunderstanding. His knowing false statement falls within Guideline J, DC \u00b6 E2.A10.1.2.2, and\nalso raises Guideline E concerns (see Personal Conduct, supra).\nIn mitigation of the Criminal Conduct concerns, the two drug convictions are very dated (see\nmitigating condition \u00b6 E2.A10.1.3.1, The criminal behavior was not recent). While they cannot be\nviewed in isolation from his SF 86 misrepresentation, it has been almost five years since Applicant\u2019s\nSF 86 omission. Yet, I am unable to conclude that there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation\n(see MC \u00b6E2.A10.1.3.6) because Applicant continues to deny any culpability with respect to the\n\nApplicant continued to deny at his hearing that he had referred the undercover officer to an specific individual\n8\nat the lounge. When asked whether he explained the circumstances to the judge, he denied the opportunity as his lawyer\nwho \u201cdid most of the talking.\u201d  According to Applicant, he explained it to his lawyer, who \u201cwas more interested in\nmaking a deal than finding out the truth.\u201d (Tr. 63)\nWhen asked whether he sold the drugs to a coworker to make money, Applicant testified , \u201cA small amount.\n9\nAnd I also had you know it was basically somebody asking me and I would get it for them you know.\u201d (Tr. 80) He had\npreviously told the DSS agent that he began selling for profit because he had the opportunity to purchase large amounts\nat a price that put him in a position where he could make \u201ca significant profit on the transactions.\u201d (Ex. 4)\n9\n1975 conviction for distribution of a controlled substance,  to minimize the seriousness of his drug\n8\nsales to a coworker while employed by a defense contractor,  and to deny any intentional falsification\n9\nof his SF 86.\nGuideline E\u2014Personal Conduct\nUnder the guideline for Personal Conduct, the security concern is that conduct involving\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness\nto comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard\nclassified information.  Directive \u00b6E2.A5.1.1.  \nGuideline E DC \u00b6E2.A5.1.2.2, The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of\nrelevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement,\nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits\nor status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities, applies because of his deliberate omission of his 1975 drug conviction from his SF\n86.\nSerious personal judgment concerns are also raised by his multiple sales of marijuana from\nabout July 1993 to April 1994, in quantities of one pound, and at least once double that, to a\ncoworker at a significant profit. Even though the transactions took place off company property,\nApplicant knew his conduct was against the law,  and because of its illegality, would not have been\ncondoned by his employer. Applicant\u2019s demonstrated unwillingness to conform his behavior to what\nis expected of an employee with a CONFIDENTIAL clearance (whether granted by his employer\nwith delegated authority or by the DOD), engenders significant doubts about whether he can be\ncounted on to properly safeguard classified information. DC \u00b6 E2.A5.1.2.5, A pattern of dishonesty\nor rule violations, including violation of any written or recorded agreement made between the\nindividual and the agency, applies as he knowingly violated the laws and his employer\u2019s rules or\npolicies against illegal drug involvement. His conduct as a middleman in these drug transactions also\nimplicates \u00b6 E2.A5.1.2.6, Association with persons involved in criminal activity.\nTo his credit, Applicant disclosed his drug conviction at age 18 and his nine months of drug\nsales in 1994 when he was interviewed by a Defense Security Service (DSS) special agent on\nDecember 2, 2003. The Guideline E concerns raised by his knowing falsification of his SF 86 may\nbe mitigated by a prompt good faith effort at rectification (see \u00b6 E2.A5.1.3.3, The individual made\nprompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being\nconfronted with the facts). It is not clear whether the investigator knew of the 1975 drug distribution\nconviction before Applicant told him. Even assuming Applicant volunteered his conviction, his\n\n10\ndisclosure more than one year after his SF 86 is not prompt. At his hearing, Applicant raised for the\nfirst time that he might have acted on reliance of advice from the person at company X who\nprocessed the forms (\u201cI think I might have asked a woman who actually processes the forms. And\nI explained to them and they said don\u2019t put it down.\u201d Tr. 67). While he named a person, he indicated\nshe no longer worked for the company. His uncorroborated claim is not enough to satisfy MC \u00b6\nE2.A5.1.3.4, Omission of material facts was caused or significantly contributed to by improper or\ninadequate advice of authorized personnel, and the previously omitted information was promptly\nand fully provided. As for his illegal drug sales, there is no evidence to show that he continues to\nassociate with any known drug users or suppliers (see \u00b6 E2.A5.1.3.7, Association with persons\ninvolved in criminal activities has ceased).\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.\nApplicant has demonstrated little respect for the law for more than 30 years (see \u00b6 E2.2.1.1, The\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct). He possessed, used and distributed illegal drugs to\nfriends for many years, even after he had been convicted of a drug offense. In 1993, he seized an\nopportunity to make a significant personal profit by selling marijuana in substantial quantity of one\npound or more. For the next nine months, he sold marijuana to a coworker without concern for his\nfiduciary obligations to his employer. He benefitted from having his six-year prison term suspended,\nbut when presented the opportunity to demonstrate that he had fully reformed, he elected to conceal\nrelevant and material facts about his past illegal drug involvement (see \u00b6 E2.2.1.6, The presence or\nabsence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes).  The passage of time since his\ndrug sales and SF 86 falsification are not enough to overcome the very substantial doubts that persist\nfor his judgment and reliability. He continues to minimize the seriousness of his illegal drug sales\nand shows little remorse.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On September 16, 2004 DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\n\n2\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended)(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On August 28, 2006, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Martin H. Mogul denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge failed to apply the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept when evaluating his case, and whether the Judge\u2019s decision not to apply mitigating\nfactors in Applicant\u2019s favor was arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.  The Board affirms the\nJudge\u2019s decision. \nApplicant argues that the Judge erred in not considering the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, and by\nignoring Applicant\u2019s stable family and work life, his honorable military career, and his efforts to take\ncontrol of his financial life.  Applicant also argues that the Judge erred by ignoring facts in the record\nwhich resulted in a conclusion that, ultimately, mitigation had not been established.  As Applicant\u2019s\narguments about the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept and mitigation are interrelated, they will be discussed\ntogether.\nRegarding both the \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis and mitigation, Applicant asserts that the Judge\ndid not fully present and consider evidence favorable to him.  There is a rebuttable presumption that\nthe Judge has considered all the record evidence unless the Judge specifically states otherwise.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 01-22566 at 3 (App. Bd. June 26, 2003).  Furthermore, the Judge was not\nrequired to discuss each and every piece of evidence in his decision.  A review of the Judge\u2019s\ndecision reveals that there were significant references to evidence favorable to Applicant.  Applicant\nhas not met his burden of establishing that the Judge ignored record evidence.\nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors does not\nturn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their\napplication requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating\nevidence does not compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of\nfact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence\noutweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An Applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s\nweighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-08934 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug.\n17, 2006).\nIn this case, after a review of the record and the Judge\u2019s decision, the Board concludes that\nthe Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the seriousness of the\ndisqualifying conduct, and adequately considered the possible application of relevant mitigating\nconditions and whole person factors.  The Judge explicitly applied one mitigating factor to\nApplicant\u2019s history of overdue indebtedness under Guideline F, but articulated a rational basis for\nconcluding that the evidence relating to the factor was not of a magnitude to support an ultimate\nconclusion in Applicant\u2019s favor.  Given the record that was before him, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that\nApplicant had intentionally provided false or misleading information on his security clearance\napplication is sustainable.  The Judge\u2019s decision not to apply mitigating factors to the falsification\n\n3\nallegations under Guideline E is also sustainable.  The Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance\ndecision is not arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-09488 at 2-3\n(App. Bd.

On March 29, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Joan Caton\nAnthony denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.   Applicant timely appealed pursuant\n1\nto the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in concluding\nApplicant\u2019s falsification of his security clearance application was deliberate; whether the Judge\u2019s\nadverse security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nApplicant contends that he did not deliberately falsify his security clearance application by\nfailing to disclose a public record civil court action for fraud against the United States Government\nin which he was named as a party.  In support of this contention, he argues that the omission of the\ninformation in question was due to a misunderstanding on his part, and he subsequently provided\nthe correct information.  He also argues that his testimony as to the events at issue was credible and\nthe version offered by the government\u2019s agents was flawed.  Applicant\u2019s arguments in this regard\ndo not demonstrate harmful error on the part of the Judge.\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  Our scope\nof review under this standard is narrow and we may not substitute our judgment for that of the Judge.\nClose cases should be resolved in favor of national security, rather than in favor of the Applicant.\nSee, e.g. DISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n \nThe Board\u2019s review of a Judge\u2019s findings is limited to determining if they are supported by\nsubstantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n\u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from\nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620,\n(1966).  A Judge\u2019s credibility determinations are entitled to deference on appeal.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 03-05072 at 5 (App. Bd. July 14, 2005).  Although such determinations are not immune\nfrom review, the party challenging them has a heavy burden. See ISCR Case No. 04-00225  at 2\n(App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2006).   \nAlthough the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations are flawed in part, her material findings as\nto Applicant\u2019s conduct of security concern are ultimately sustainable.  The judge made two\nproblematic statements regarding her credibility determinations.  First, as a threshold factor in her\ncredibility determination of Applicant, the Judge states in her decision, \u201cApplicant was seeking to\nretain a security clearance he had held for 30 years, and this motive weighs against him in my\ncredibility determination.  The DSS special agent was a government employee doing his job, and in\nthat capacity he knew there is a significant penalty for providing false information.\u201d  The Judge was\n\nThe Judge\u2019s use of the term \u201cmisconduct\u201d in the footnote reference to the second agent\u2019s testimony is puzzling.\n2\nThere is no evidence in the record that suggests the inaccuracies in the agent\u2019s testimony were the result of any sort of\nmisconduct.  Of course, even innocent errors may have a negative impact upon credibility. \n3\nentitled to believe either witness (Applicant or the DSS agent) in whole or in part.  She was also\nentitled to evaluate the credibility of each witness with reference to all evidence relevant to\ncredibility, including possible motives for not being honest.  However, the Judge\u2019s threshold\nstatement highlighting Applicant\u2019s diminished credibility as a result of his seeking to retain his\nsecurity clearance sweeps too broadly.  All DOHA Applicants are seeking to obtain or retain security\nclearances.  To the extent that the Judge\u2019s statement suggests that Applicants are categorically less\nworthy of belief than government witnesses (even before considering other factors and evidence in\nthe case that relate to credibility), it is error.  There is no rule in DOHA proceedings which supports\na general proposition the effect of which is to render Applicants, as a class, less worthy of belief\nsimply because of their status as Applicants.\nSecond, part of the Judge\u2019s adverse credibility determination of Applicant is based on her\nconclusion that a second DSS investigative agent offered credible testimony that was at odds with\nApplicant\u2019s testimony.  The Judge also concluded that there were errors and inaccuracies in the\ntestimony of this second agent (who became involved in the case after the DSS agent referenced in\nthe preceding paragraph).  The Judge ultimately concluded that the errors and inaccuracies did not\nmaterially affect the second agent\u2019s credibility, and she went on in a footnote to state, \u201c[a]s a general\nproposition, misconduct by a DSS investigator that does not detract from his or her credibility does\nnot justify a clearance for the applicant being interviewed.\u201d  Here, the Judge\u2019s comments about the\nlack of effect upon credibility of inaccuracies in the second agent\u2019s testimony are erroneous.  Clearly,\nthe inaccuracies in the testimony of the second agent do detract from the Judge\u2019s favorable\ncredibility determination of that witness.   \n2\nNotwithstanding these errors, The Administrative Judge adverse credibility determination\nof Applicant, which is entitled to deference on appeal because of the Judge\u2019s unique opportunity to\nobserve Applicant\u2019s demeanor, is ultimately sustainable in that it relies in large part on factual\nfindings and conclusions that are supported by substantial record evidence.  These factors include:\n(I) Applicant\u2019s failure to provide pertinent information regarding a fraud lawsuit, to which he was\nonce a party, on his security clearance application; (ii)  the prior allegations of fraud brought by the\nU.S. government (in a civil lawsuit) that involved Applicant and his company, the disposition of\nwhich left the issue of Applicant\u2019s culpability unresolved: (iii) the plausibility of a motive to conceal\nthe fact of the lawsuit on Applicant\u2019s part (arising from the fact that the issue of his culpability\nremained unresolved, notwithstanding the fact that he, personally, had been dropped as a party to the\nlitigation); (iv) the strength of the first DSS agent\u2019s testimony, parts of which were corroborated by\nApplicant\u2019s own testimony; (v) Applicant\u2019s extensive educational background; and (vi) Applicant\u2019s\nconsiderable familiarity with the security clearance application process.  Ultimately, there is an\nadequate basis for the Judge\u2019s adverse credibility determination of Applicant, and the errors\ndescribed in the preceding paragraphs are harmless. \nThe Judge had the opportunity to consider Applicant\u2019s explanation for why he failed to\ndisclose the information in question.  The Judge was not bound, as a matter of law, to accept or reject\nApplicant\u2019s explanation.  The Judge considered Applicant\u2019s explanation in light of the record\nevidence as a whole, and concluded there was a sufficient basis to find that Applicant\u2019s omission was\n\n4\ndeliberate and intentional.  On this record, the Judge\u2019s finding of deliberate falsification is\nsustainable.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1; ISCR Case No. 04-03849 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006).\nThe security concern raised by Applicant\u2019s falsification was not necessarily overcome by Applicant\u2019s\nsubsequent disclosures to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 01-19513 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 22,\n2004).\nIn the alternative, Applicant contends that the Judge should have found that the security\nconcerns raised by Applicant\u2019s falsification had been mitigated, as a matter of law, under the\nGuideline E mitigating conditions and the Directive\u2019s whole person factors.   In support of this\ncontention, Applicant argues that his falsification was an isolated incident; it was not recent; it was\nnot likely to recur; it would not render him vulnerable to pressure or coercion; he had subsequently\nprovided the correct information; the information regarding the civil lawsuit against him for fraud\nagainst the government was not pertinent to a determination of judgment, trustworthiness, or\nreliability; and its security significance is outweighed by his otherwise unblemished 30 year history.\nAgain, Applicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.\n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish mitigation.\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person\nfactors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a\ncase.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some\nmitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.\nAs the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable\nevidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nrecency and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the possible application of\nrelevant mitigating conditions and whole person factors.  The Judge found in favor of the Applicant\nwith respect to the other SOR allegation.  However, the Judge reasonably explained why the\nevidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome all of the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  Applicant offers a\nrational alternative interpretation of the record evidence.  But that alternative interpretation of the\nrecord evidence is insufficient to render the Judge\u2019s interpretation arbitrary, capricious or contrary\nto law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-19101 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 13, 2006).  The Judge has articulated\na rational explanation for her unfavorable determination under the disqualifying and mitigating\nfactors and the whole-person concept, and there is sufficient record evidence to support that\ndetermination\u2014given the standard that required the Judge to err on the side of national security. See,\ne.g., DISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).  Based on the record that was before\nher, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guideline E sustainable.\n\n5\nOrder\nThe decision of the Administrative Judge denying Applicant a clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

On February\n8, 2007, the Board remanded the case to the Judge for a new hearing.  On January 31, 2008, the\nJudge issued her remand decision, again denying Applicant a security clearance.  Applicant\nsubmitted a timely appeal pursuant to the Directive.\nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s conclusions under\nGuidelines K and E are inconsistent; whether the Judge erred in concluding that Applicant\u2019s case\nraised Guideline K security concerns; whether the Judge erred in concluding that certain of the\nGuideline E allegations constitute security concerns; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis\nis arbitrary and capricious.  We also construe Applicant\u2019s appeal as alleging that the Judge was\nbiased against him.   Finding no error, we affirm.\n1\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant worked for a government\ncontractor from July 1986 to March 1987.  He was counseled and/or issued \u201cdeficiency notices\u201d for\nsuch infractions as poor work performance, failure to follow procedures, failure to meet production\ndeadlines, and unprofessional demeanor.

The\nrecord would not lead a reasonable person to question the fairness or impartiality of the Judge.  See\nISCR Case No. 05-04923 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 24, 2007).  We conclude that the Judge did not err in\nholding against Applicant under Guideline E for misconduct she has resolved in his favor under\nGuideline K.  \u201cAn Applicant\u2019s security related conduct can be alleged under more than one\nGuideline and, in an appropriate case, can be given independent weight  by an administrative judge\nunder different Guidelines.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-09251 at 3 (App. Bd.

In the case\nunder consideration, the Judge has articulated a rational basis for her conclusions under Guideline\nE, and her adverse decision on those matters is sustainable.     \n3\n  \nThe Judge properly concluded that Applicant\u2019s case raised security concerns under\nGuidelines K and E.  Furthermore, she has drawn a \u201crational connection between the facts found\u201d\nand her conclusion that neither the various mitigating conditions nor the whole-person factors\nsupport a decision favorable to Applicant.

The presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone\ncompel a favorable overall security clearance decision.  See, e. g., ISCR Case No. 05-03452 at 3\n(App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  The record supports the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant has failed to\nmeet his burden of persuasion that it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d for him to have\na clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Based on the entire record in this case, including Applicant\u2019s hearings of February 24, 2006, March 8, 2006, and May 16, 2007, all exhibits entered into evidence, and the testimony of Applicant and all witnesses called, I make the following findings of fact: The SOR in this case contains eight allegations of disqualifying conduct under Guideline K, Security Violations, and four allegations under Guideline E, Personal Conduct. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted eleven of the twelve allegations but denied they were disqualifying conduct under Guidelines K and E. He denied that four allegations he admitted under Guideline K were security concerns under Guideline E. He noted mitigating circumstances. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. Applicant is 49 years old. Since 2005, he has been employed as a senior systems scientist by a government contractor. He holds a bachelor of science degree in electronics and engineering and a master of science degree in mechanical and 4 aerospace engineering. He is taking course work toward a Ph.D degree. He has held a security clearance since 1983. (Tr. I, 12; Tr. III at 207, Ex. 1; Ex. C.) Applicant was married in 1982 and divorced in 1986. He is the father of two adult children. (Ex. 1.) He has not remarried. In 1988, Applicant was incarcerated for three days by order of a state circuit court judge following a complaint by his ex-wife that Applicant was harassing her.

L\u2019Heureux, Esquire\n_________________\nRemand Decision\n_________________\nANTHONY, Joan Caton, Administrative Judge:\nApplicant\u2019s noncompliance with security regulations in 1999 and 2000 raised\ndoubts about his trustworthiness and ability to safeguard classified information.  At his\nhearing on remand, Applicant produced credible refutation and mitigation for five of six\nalleged Guideline K security violations.  However, his personal conduct, when reviewed\nin light of a whole person analysis, raised security concerns which he failed to mitigate.\nClearance is denied.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant.  On March 23, 2005, under the applicable\nExecutive Order  and Department of Defense Directive,  DOHA issued a Statement of\n1\n2\nReasons (SOR), detailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under\nGuideline K (Security Violations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.\nJanuary 31, 2008\n\n None of the documents offered by Applicant contained markings indicating they were classified documents.\n3\n2\nOn April 11, 2005, Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR and elected to\nhave a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me\nNovember 22, 2005. On February 24, 2006, I convened a hearing to consider whether it\nwas clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance\nfor Applicant.  I continued Applicant's hearing, and it resumed on March 8, 2006.  The\nGovernment called no witnesses, introduced 13 exhibits (Ex.), and offered one\ndocument for administrative notice.\nApplicant, who appeared pro se, objected to each of the Government\u2019s proposed\nexhibits. His objections were overruled. Applicant called no witnesses. Three of\nApplicant\u2019s proposed exhibits, D, F, and G, were e-mails composed and transmitted\nwhen Applicant was employed by a previous government contractor.  Applicant was\nunable to affirm that matters referred to in the e-mails were not classified.  I did not\nadmit Applicant\u2019s  Ex. D, F, and G.  I returned the three exhibits to him, advised him to\nconsult with an attorney or his security manager about the documents in question, and\ncontinued the hearing.\nWhen his hearing resumed on March 8, 2006, Applicant again appeared pro se\nand attempted to introduce four additional e-mail documents and was unable to affirm\nthat the documents did not contain or allude to classified information.   I returned the\n3\ndocuments to Applicant, and did not admit them to the record.\n  \nApplicant introduced 10 documents which were not admitted into evidence.  He\nwithdrew one proposed exhibit before it was identified. The following exhibits introduced\nby Applicant were admitted into evidence:  Ex. A, C, I, J, K, L1 through L-8, M, N, O, P,\nQ, R, S, T, U, and V.   DOHA received the transcript (Tr. I ) of the February 24, 2006\nproceeding on March 6, 2006; it received  the transcript (Tr. II ) of the March 8, 2006\nproceeding on March 16, 2006. \nOn June 12, 2006, I issued a decision denying Applicant\u2019s security clearance.\nApplicant appealed.  On February 8, 2007, DOHA\u2019s Appeal Board found it could not\nconclude from the record that Applicant had received the due process provided for in\nExecutive Order 10865 and the Directive, and it remanded the case and directed me to\nreopen the case and provide Applicant with a new hearing.  The Appeal Board pointed\nout that it was error for me to fail to preserve a complete record for appeal by returning\nto Applicant the exhibits he had offered and which I had not admitted into evidence.\nFurther, the Appeal Board noted:\nWhere a document is offered as an exhibit by one of the\nparties and discussed on the record, the document (or a\ncopy thereof) should be marked for identification by the\nJudge and placed in the file of the case, even if the Judge\nconcludes that the document should not be admitted into\nevidence. [Citations omitted.] Department of Defense rules\nshould be applied to documents that are classified or are\n\n3\nreasonably suspected of being in need of classification\nreview.\nISCR Case NO. 03-08257 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2007.)\nTo comply with the Appeal Board\u2019s directions, I convened a new hearing for\nApplicant on May 16, 2007.  The hearing convened on May 16, 2007, and produced a\ntranscript of 469 pages.  The Government  called no witnesses and introduced 14\nExhibits (Ex.), which were marked as Government\u2019s Ex. 2-1 through 2-14. The\nGovernment also introduced one document for administrative notice, which was marked\nas Ex. 2-15. Applicant objected to the admission of Government Ex. 2-9 and Ex. 2-10.  I\nadmitted the two exhibits over Applicant\u2019s objections.  I noted that the two exhibits\ncontained adverse e-mail communications, composed in 2000, from Applicant\u2019s\nworkplace.  I advised the parties  that I would carefully assess how much weight I would\ngive to each exhibit.  Government Exs. 1 through  8 and 11 through 14 were admitted to\nthe record without objection.  Government Ex. 15 was also admitted without objection. \nApplicant testified on his own behalf and called five witnesses.  In addition,\nApplicant introduced 24 Exhibits, which were marked Applicant\u2019s Ex. A-2-1 through A-2-\n24.  Applicant\u2019s exhibits were admitted to the record without objection.  Applicant\u2019s Ex.\nA-2-16 was an e-mail communication from a former co-worker of Applicant\u2019s.   At the\nconclusion of the hearing, I left the record open so that Applicant could submit a letter\nfrom the co-worker in lieu of the e-mail.  On May 23, 2007, Applicant submitted, by\nfacsimile, the letter from the co-worker and asked that it be entered in the record as a\nsubstitute for the e-mail previously entered as Ex. A-2-16.  Department Counsel did not\nobject to Applicant\u2019s request. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s new Ex. A-2-16 was entered in\nthe record of the proceeding.  DOHA received the transcript of the proceeding on May\n30, 2007. \nFindings of Fact\nBased on the entire record in this case, including Applicant\u2019s hearings of\nFebruary 24, 2006, March 8, 2006, and May 16, 2007, all exhibits entered into\nevidence, and the testimony of  Applicant and all witnesses called,  I make the following\nfindings of fact:\nThe SOR in this case contains eight allegations of disqualifying conduct under\nGuideline K, Security Violations, and four allegations under Guideline E, Personal\nConduct.  In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted eleven of the twelve allegations\nbut denied they were disqualifying conduct under Guidelines K and E.  He denied that\nfour allegations he admitted under Guideline K were security concerns under Guideline\nE. He noted mitigating circumstances. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated as\nfindings of fact.  \nApplicant is 49 years old.  Since 2005, he has been employed as a senior\nsystems scientist by a government contractor.  He holds a bachelor of science degree in\nelectronics and engineering and a master of science degree in mechanical and\n\n4\naerospace engineering. He is taking course work toward a Ph.D degree.  He has held a\nsecurity clearance since 1983.  (Tr. I, 12; Tr. III at 207, Ex. 1; Ex. C.)  \nApplicant was married in 1982 and divorced in 1986.  He is the father of two adult\nchildren.  (Ex. 1.) He has not remarried.  In 1988, Applicant was incarcerated for three\ndays by order of a state circuit court judge following a complaint by his ex-wife that\nApplicant was harassing her. On the security clearance application (SF-86) he certified\non February 10, 2006, Applicant supplied information about his ex-wife and then added\nthe following additional comment: \u201cNot an individual that I would recommend for a\nposition of trust. . . .\u201d (Ex. 2-1, Ex. 2-14.)\nFrom July 1986 to March 1987, Applicant was employed by a government\ncontractor (Employer A) as a systems analyst.  Between about February 6, 1987 and\nMarch 4, 1987, Applicant was orally counseled or was issued deficiency/misconduct\nnotices approximately seven times. The counseling and deficiency notices related to\ntardiness, poor work performance, failure to follow company procedures in working with\nsupport staff, failure to meet production deadlines, and unprofessional demeanor. (Ex.\n2-13.)\nWhen Applicant worked for Employer A, he sought to organize a company-\nsponsored volleyball team; in cooperation with Applicant, the company\u2019s human\nresources department provided him with a roster of employees who wanted to play on\nthe company\u2019s team. The county where the team sought registration required that all\nvolleyball players certify with their signatures that they were residents of the county.\nWhen Applicant obtained the list, there were several prospective players who had not\nsigned to verify their status as county residents. Without their permission, Applicant\nsigned the names of those employees on the roster. He then caused the roster to be\nfiled with the county. Thereafter,  he sought  reimbursement from the employer of the\nfiling fees he paid to the county to register the roster of players.  Employer A fired\nApplicant on approximately March 9, 1987 for violating its business practices and ethics.\nApplicant filed a claim for  unemployment benefits form his state of residence after he\nwas fired.  The state unemployment commission hearing examiner found that the nature\nof Applicant\u2019s separation from his employment disqualified him from receiving\nunemployment benefits.  Applicant appealed. On appeal, the state employment\ncommission found that Applicant\u2019s employer set forth a prima facie case of misconduct\nand that the record supported a finding that Applicant \u201cwas discharged for unethical\nconduct concerning his efforts to organize an employer/sponsored volleyball team.\u201d (Ex.\n2-11 at 3-5, Ex. 2-12; Tr. III, 340-348.)\nApplicant objected to the inclusion of the information about his falsification of  the\nco-workers\u2019 signatures because it occurred 18 years ago.  He testified that he thought\noff-duty conduct had some relation to on-duty conduct, but he characterized his on-duty\nconduct as \u201csterling\u201d and he asserted the employer did not specify how he had violated\nthe business practices and ethics code. ( Ex. N; Tr. II, 107.)  DOHA alleged in SOR \u00b6\n2.c. that Applicant\u2019s conduct in falsifying the signatures of his co-workers raised a\nsecurity concern under Guideline E.\n\n5\nApplicant certified an application for federal employment (SF-171) on August 23,\n1989. Question 39 on the SF-171 asks an applicant for federal employment if he or she\nhas been fired from any job in the previous ten years. Applicant responded \u201cyes\u201d to\nQuestion 39 and reported his firing from Employer A as \u201cact[ing] inappropriately in\nforming a company-sponsored sports team\u201d and being accused by his employer \u201cof\nforging signatures for the roster.\u201d He then added: \u201cI believe the true reason for the\ntermination was due to my inability to control my then ex-wife and her harassment of me\nat my place of work.\u201d  At his hearing on remand on May 16, 2007, Applicant opined that\nhe was fired from his job by Employer A because the company mangers failed to\nappreciate his work and found his engineering assessments \u201cdid not go along with their\ngeopolitical goal as a company.\u201d (Ex.2-2 at 3, 12; Tr. III, 348-350.)\n \nOn the SF-171 he completed on August 23, 1989, Applicant reported he worked\nas a project task leader for Employer B from January 1989 to April 1989.  He reported,\nalso in response to Question 39, that he left Employer B under threat of termination.  He\nalso reported that Employer B alleged he had violated his contract and withheld his last\npaycheck. (Ex. 2-2 at 3-4.)\n \nFrom 1996 to 2005, Applicant was employed by a government contractor as an\nelectrical engineer (Employer C).  He left that job under unfavorable circumstances.  On\nthe SF-86 he certified on February 10, 2006, Applicant stated he left his job as an\nelectrical engineer as the result of \u201cchange in employer requirements.  Employer felt I\nwas unable to fill any other jobs that they had at that time.\u201d  (SF-86, signed by Applicant\non February 10, 2006, at 26.)  At his hearing on March 8, 2006,  Applicant explained he\nleft his job as an electrical engineer because an individual who reviewed his work did\nnot think he performed his job adequately.  (Tr. II, 103-104.)\nIn his work as a government contractor, Applicant was responsible for the\nprotection of classified information. During the period 1999 to 2000, he did not have\noriginal or derivative classification authority.  He had recommended classification\nauthority.  He relied on agency guidance  for a determination of what was and was not\nclassified information. (Tr. III, 368-372.)\nIn March 1999, as a part of his regular duties, Applicant received a spreadsheet,\nand it was his job to gather and compile unclassified information to go on the\nspreadsheet format.  Once this was done, Applicant passed the spreadsheet to another\nindividual, who posted the spreadsheet on an unclassified web site.  In November 1999,\nApplicant was responsible for updating the information on the spreadsheet. After he\nupdated the unclassified information by e-mail, officials in another office, who had\nreceived the e-mail, informed his chain of command that a certain part of the\nspreadsheet contained information that was classified.  Applicant\u2019s supervisors did not\nagree the information was classified, but they eventually acceded to the designation\nproposed by the other office.  They removed the specified information from the\nspreadsheet and the website, and it was labeled classified.  The military manager who\nwas responsible for providing Applicant with the spreadsheet information provided a\nstatement for the record, which reads, in pertinent part, as follows: \u201cThe information was\nnot deemed classified . . . when posted on the web or during the updating of the\nspreadsheet; it became classified upon the subsequent ops-coordinated review.\n\nThe government alleged this fact in SOR 2.b. To corroborate the allegation, the government provided at Ex.\n4\n2-4 at 4, a photocopied document identified as \u201cSecurity Container Check Sheet\u201d marked \u201cMar 00.\u201d  It was not\npossible to decipher whether an entry was or was not made on February 28, 2000.\nThe decision to decertify Applicant was made by a colonel who was chief of the division on the basis of\n5\ninformation supplied to him by the major identified as the unit\u2019s security manager. (Ex. 2-4.)\nEx. 2-8 identifies the author of the e-mails in Ex. 2-9 and Ex. 2-10 as the \u201c[Deleted] security manager.\u201d In\n6\ntestimony on remand, Applicant identified the individual as \u201c 1 of 30 officers that I dealt with and actually wasn\u2019t\none of the more significant ones, so I can\u2019t say it was a security issue and he brought it to my attention.\u201d  (Tr.\nIII at 403.)  \n6\n[Applicant] had no way of knowing the information was classified.\u201d (Ex. A-2-16; Ex. 2-8;\nTr. III, 241-248.)  In SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b., DOHA alleged that Applicant was responsible\nfor security incidents arising from the information posted on the spreadsheet in March\n1999 and November 1999.\nOn February 29, 2000, Applicant\u2019s security manager sent an e-mail notification to\nthe chief military officer in Applicant\u2019s chain of command notifying her that when\nApplicant had closed the unit\u2019s office the previous evening, he had  failed to initial the\noutside form or to initial that he had performed the closing checklist.  Applicant stated\n4\nhis employer did not inform him of this incident.  On April 7, 2000 and April 9, 2000,\nApplicant was responsible for securing his work facility.  On April 7, 2000, he failed to\nproperly secure the combination lock and to perform other steps to activate motor\nsensors in the office.  On April 9, 2000, he also failed to secure the combination lock\nand to pull a small pin attached to a lock on the door. Later, security inspectors found\nthe unsecured deadbolt locks.  Applicant learned the procedure for closing the office by\nwatching his co-workers perform the task.  He had not received formal training.  He did\nnot learn about pulling the pin on the lock until April 10, 2000.  Because Applicant\u2019s\nconduct was in violation of paragraphs 5-102 and 5-103 of the NISPOM,  he was\ndecertified to open and close the secure work area by himself after the incidents of April\n7 and 9, 2000, until he had received further training.  He did not receive further training\n5\nwhile assigned to that command, and he did not request further training from the\ncommand. These three security incidents were alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c., 1.d., and 2.b.\n(Tr. III, 292-300, 336-340, 385-390; 422-423, Ex. 2-4, Ex. 2-9, Ex. 2-15.)\nOn May 9, 2000, a major, identified as a security manager, observed Applicant at\na meeting and sent an e-mail to a senior officer in Applicant\u2019s chain of command\nexpressing concern about Applicant\u2019s handling of classified information.   The security\n6\nmanager stated that during the meeting, Applicant began to copy an unclassified file\nfrom a classified laptop computer to move it to an unclassified projection computer,\nwithout using secure copy. The security manager concluded that if Applicant had not\nbeen stopped, the projection computer would have become classified. In addition, the\nsecurity manager observed that Applicant was using an unmarked disk to store the files\nfor the briefing and that he left the briefing room with out securing the classified laptop.,\nApplicant\u2019s failure to follow these required security procedures was alleged at \u00b6\u00b6 1. e(1),\n1.e(2), and 1.e(3) of the SOR.  The allegations raised security concerns under \u00b6\u00b6  4-102\n(c), 8-102(c), 4-200, 1-200, 5-100, and 5-200 of the NISPOM. (Tr. II, 72-74; Tr. III, 302-\n321, 392-403;  Ex. 10; Ex. 2-10, Ex. 2-15.) \n\n7\nAt his hearing on remand, Applicant stated the security manager\u2019s allegations\nwere not brought to his attention.  He disputed the conclusion that plugging a classified\ncomputer into a projector would have caused the projector to become classified.  He\nobserved that an unclassified disk put into an unclassified computer would not classify\nthe computer. He stated that it was unlikely that a disk would have been brought into the\nbriefing since the laptop computer used for the briefing was already loaded with the\ninformation to be used at the briefing. He also clarified the chain of responsibility for\nhandling classified computers in his office (Tr. III, 302-320.)\nIn July 2000, Applicant attended a quadrennial defense briefing. Two military\nofficers managed the briefing. Applicant attended the briefing as a representative of his\nwork unit. Some of the material discussed at the briefing was classified. At the\nconclusion of the meeting, Applicant wrote a summary of the matters discussed at the\nmeeting. Because he had attended many similar briefings, he felt confident he could\ndistinguish between the classified and non-classified material discussed at the meeting.\nHe sent the summary he had written to the two military officers who had conducted the\nmeeting and asked them to confirm that his summary was accurate. One of the officers\nresponded on a collateral matter within 24 hours, and Applicant interpreted his response\nas a confirmation that his summary was accurate.  He did not hear immediately from the\nsecond officer.  Acting on his interpretation that the first officer thought his summary\nwas accurate, Applicant sent his summary by e-mail on an unclassified network to about\n20 people in his office. Soon after the e-mail was sent, it was determined that\nApplicant\u2019s summary contained classified information, and the classified information had\nbeen sent over an unclassified system.  Applicant was removed from his job and\nreassigned the next day to another office and another project. An investigation was\nconducted .  Applicant\u2019s conduct was categorized as a security deviation which resulted\nin no damage to national security.  (Ex. 2-5; Tr.III, 321-333, 403-406, 416-421.)  This\nsecurity violation was alleged at \u00b6 1.f. of the SOR and identified as a violation of\nparagraph 5-403 of the NISPOM.\n \nDOHA alleged that the security incidents alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., and\n1.e. of the SOR revealed questionable judgment, unreliability, and unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations, conduct that created a security concern under\nGuideline E of the Directive.  (The SOR at \u00b6 2.a. alleges the Guideline K disqualifying\nconduct is also disqualifying conduct under Guideline E.)  Applicant did not deny the\nconduct, but he denied it was a security concern under Guideline E.  (Answer to SOR.)\nApplicant submitted a letter of character reference from his first-line supervisor,\nwho had worked with him for approximately six months. The supervisor praised\nApplicant\u2019s honesty, integrity, and technical skill. (Ex. L-1.)  Applicant supplied additional\ne-mail transmissions and letters of character reference from present and former co-\nworkers, all of whom attested to his trustworthiness.  (Ex. L-2 to L-8.; Ex. I, Q, .R, S, T,\nU.)  He also supplied letters of appreciation he received from managers who evaluated\nhis work in 1991 and 1997. (Ex. J; Ex. M.)  At his hearing on remand, Applicant called\nfive witnesses.  Four of the witnesses had worked directly with the Applicant, and they\ntestified to his care in handling classified information.  All four witnesses also testified\nthat they had not seen the SOR and were not aware of the allegations in Applicant\u2019s\ncase.  (Tr. 97-99, 104, 114-117, 126-127, 137-140, 145-146, 157-161, 170.)    \n\n8\nI take administrative notice of the following sections of the National Security\nProgram Operating Manual (NISPOM), DoD 5220.22-M, dated January 1995: \u00b6\u00b6 5-403,\n5-102, 5-103, 4-102(c), 8\u2013102(c), 4-200, 1-200, 5-100, 5-200.\nPolicies\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to .\n. . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether\nan individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  Id. at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for\naccess to classified information to United States citizens \u201cwhose personal and\nprofessional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of\ncharacter, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well\nas freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and\nability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified\ninformation.\u201d  Exec. Or. 12968, Access to Classified Information \u00a7 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).\nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive.  \nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the\ndisqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.  In\nevaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also\nassess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  The decision to\ndeny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication that the\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in\nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify,\nthe applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484\nU.S. at 531.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection between proven\nconduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2,\n1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial\nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the\nfacts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); see Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No.\n01-20700 at 3.\n\n9\nAnalysis\nGuideline K - Security Violations \nIn the SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline K of the Directive that Applicant\nfailed to comply with security regulations on six occasions.  DOHA further alleged that\nApplicant\u2019s non-compliance resulted in eight security incidents which violated nine\nprovisions of the NISPOM. (See NISPOM \u00b6\u00b6 1-200,  4-102(c), 4-200, 5-100, 5-102, 5-\n103, 5-200, 5-403, and 8-102(c).)  In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the\neight security incidents specified in the SOR at \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.f.  Noncompliance with\nsecurity regulations raises doubt about an individual\u2019s trustworthiness, willingness, and\nability to safeguard classified information.  E2.A11.1.1. \nUnder the adjudicative Guideline K applicable in this case, security concerns are\nraised and could be disqualifying when there is an unauthorized disclosure of classified\ninformation (E2.A11.1.2.1) and when an applicant is responsible for violations that are\ndeliberate or multiple or due to negligence. (E2.A11.1.2.2.)\nApplicant\u2019s everyday work conditions as a government contractor required using\nand protecting classified information.  Because they identify possible unauthorized and\ndeliberate or negligent disclosures of classified information,  SOR allegations 1.a., 1.b.,\nand 1.f. raise security concerns under Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A11.1.2.1 and\nDC E2.A11.1.2.2.  At his hearing on remand, Applicant provided credible information\nestablishing that he placed unclassified information on a spreadsheet that was later\ntransmitted to an unclassified web site in March 1999. He also provided credible\ninformation that the same information was not classified when he updated the\nspreadsheet in November 1999 and e-mailed it via an unclassified web site to others\nauthorized to receive it. He also provided credible information to establish that some of\nthe information on the spreadsheet was later upgraded to classified as the result of an\ninternal review. Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant rebutted SOR allegations 1.a. and\n1.b. and demonstrated that his actions as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b. were not in\nviolation of paragraph 5-403 of the NISPOM.\nSOR allegation 1.f. also raises security concerns under DC E2.A11.1.2.1. and\nDC E2.A11.1.2.2.  At his remand hearing, Applicant testified that in July 2000, he wrote\na summary of matters discussed at a quadrennial defense briefing and felt confident\nthat his summary did not contain classified information. He sent his summary to the two\nmilitary officers who were responsible for the meeting. He heard back from one officer,\nand he interpreted the officer\u2019s response as clearance to send his summary as an\nunclassified document.  Applicant sent his summary as an unclassified e-mail document\nover an unclassified network. The e-mail summary was reviewed and determined to\ncontain classified information.  Applicant was removed from his position and assigned to\nanother office and another project. An investigation was conducted and Applicant\u2019s\nconduct was deemed to be a security deviation which resulted in no damage to national\nsecurity. \nApplicant\u2019s actions resulted in the unauthorized disclosure of classified\ninformation. While his unauthorized disclosure of classified information was not\n\n10\ndeliberate, it appears to have been caused by negligence consequent to misplaced\nconfidence in his ability to distinguish classified and unclassified information. Applicant\npossessed neither original nor derivative classification authority. In creating his\nsummary he had a duty to request clarification regarding the information in the\nsummary and whether it was classified or unclassified.  He failed to exercise that duty\nbut relied on assumptions that his past methods of inquiry for clarification were sufficient\nto prevent the unauthorized disclosure of classified information in this instance.  His\nassumption that one of the two officers had provided clearance for the release of his\nsummary was not correct.  \nWe turn to an examination of applicable mitigating conditions under Guideline K.\nAn applicant may mitigate security violation concerns if he shows the security violations\nwere inadvertent \u00b6 E2.A11.1.3.1; isolated or infrequent \u00b6 E2.A11.1.3.2.;due to improper\nor inadequate training \u00b6 E2.A11.1.3.3.; or if the individual demonstrates a positive\nattitude toward the discharge of security responsibilities \u00b6 E2.A11.1.3.4. \nApplicant\u2019s security violation appears to have occurred not through inadvertence\nbut  through a failure to exercise the due care required of a person entrusted with the\nresponsibility for working with and protecting classified information.  (See NISPOM, 1-\n200, 5-100, and 5-200.)  His violation was not isolated or infrequent, but occurred within\na context of inattentiveness that suggests a habit or pattern of behavior.  Accordingly,\nmitigating conditions E2.A11.1.3.1 and E2.A11.1.3.2 do not apply to Applicant\u2019s case.\nI also conclude that the security violation alleged at SOR 1.f. did not occur as the\nresult of improper or inadequate training, and, therefore, mitigating condition\nE2.A11.1.3.3 is inapplicable.  \nApplicant is a highly trained engineer whose livelihood is premised on work\nrequiring him to protect classified documents and information. Four of Applicant\u2019s\nwitnesses testified to his present carefulness in protecting classified information. None\nof the witnesses was aware of Applicant\u2019s previous security incidents. Applicant\ndefended his previous conduct that led to the security incident alleged at SOR 1.f., thus\nmaking it difficult to ascertain whether he had developed a specific plan for avoiding\nfuture security violations.  Accordingly, I conclude that mitigating condition E2.A11.1.3.4.\napplies only in part.\nSOR allegations 1.c. and 1.d. specify two incidents, one on April 7, 2000 and one\non April 9, 2000, when Applicant failed to close his office by properly securing a\ncombination lock and performing other steps to activate motor sensors in the office.\nWhen he attempted to close the office on April 9, 2000, he also failed to secure the\ncombination lock and to set a small pin attached to the lock on the door.  Applicant\u2019s\nfailure to lock up his secure facility was reported to his security manager. After these\nincidents were reported, Applicant was decertified to open and close the secure work\narea by himself  until he received remedial training.  His command did not provide the\nremedial training, nor did Applicant request it.\nAt his remand hearing, Applicant testified credibly that, prior to the security\nincidents, he had never received formal training in locking up his secure facility, and he\n\n11\nhad learned to lock up by watching other employees carry out the task. He\nacknowledged he didn\u2019t know about setting the pin on the lock.\nApplicant\u2019s failure on two occasions to lock up his work facility securely raises a\nsecurity concern under DC E2.A11.1.2.2.  I conclude that this conduct was inadvertent\nand due to improper or inadequate training.  Accordingly, mitigating conditions\nE2.A11.1.3.1 and E2.A11.1.3.3. apply.\nOn May 9, 2000, Applicant\u2019s security manager sent an e-mail to a senior military\nofficial describing his concern about Applicant\u2019s handling of classified information.  The\ncontents of this e-mail constitute SOR allegations 1.e(1), 1.e(2), and 1.e(3). Allegation\n1.e(1) states that Applicant started to copy an unclassified computer file from a\nclassified laptop to an unclassified projection computer without using secure copy.\nAllegation 1.e(2) states that Applicant used an unmarked disk to store files for the\nbriefing. Allegation 1.e(3) states that Applicant failed to secure a classified laptop\ncomputer at the end of the meeting.\nThe record is silent regarding the response of the senior official to the security\nmanager\u2019s e-mail allegations. Nothing in the record suggests that the allegations in the\nsecurity manager\u2019s e-mail were investigated or brought to Applicant\u2019s attention at the\ntime they allegedly occurred.  Nothing in the record corroborates the allegations in the\nsecurity manager\u2019s e-mail. I conclude the evidence has very little weight in establishing\nthat Applicant is responsible for the security violations alleged.  Additionally, Applicant\nprovided credible testimony refuting the allegations. Accordingly, I conclude SOR\nallegations 1.e(1), 1.e(2), and 1.e(3) for Applicant. \n \n Guideline E - Personal Conduct\nIn the SOR, DOHA alleged  that the Guideline K security incidents alleged at \u00b6\u00b6\n1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., and 1.e. constituted security concerns under Guideline E of the\nDirective  (\u00b6 2.a.); that on February 29, 2000, when Applicant closed the office, he failed\nto initial the security checklist to show it had been carried out, and he did not initial the\noutside form in the proper location (\u00b6 2.b.); that in March 1987, he was fired for\nmisconduct for violating his employer\u2019s code of business practices and ethics by\nfalsifying the signatures of individuals on a roster for a company-sponsored volleyball\nteam in order to obtain reimbursement for expenses relating to registering the team (\u00b6\n3.c.); and that from February 6, 1987 to March 4, 1987 he was either orally counseled or\ngiven written employee deficiency/misconduct notices for being late for work, being late\non projects, producing poor quality work, or for having an unprofessional attitude. (\u00b6\n4.d.)\nGuideline E conduct raises security concerns because it involves questionable\njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations and could indicate that an applicant may not properly\nsafeguard classified information.  Directive \u00b6 E2.A5.l.l. \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied allegation 2(a) because he had\nalready addressed the allegations enumerated there as security violations under  \u00b6\u00b6\n\nDC E2.A5.1.2.1 reads: \u201cReliable, unfavorable information provided by associates, employers, coworkers,\n7\nneighbors, and other acquaintances.\u201d  DC E2.A5.1.2.4. reads: \u201cPersonal conduct or concealment of\ninformation that increases an individual\u2019s vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress, such as engaging\nin activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s professional, or community standing or render the person\nsusceptible to blackmail.\u201d\n12\n1.a. through 1.e.   He admitted allegation 2(b) but denied it was of security significance\nunder Guideline E.  He also admitted allegations 2(c) and 2(d).\nAllegation 2(b) states that Applicant failed to follow required procedures for\nclosing his office by initialing a security checklist on February 29, 2000.  The\ngovernment\u2019s evidence in support of allegation 2(b) is barely legible and fails to\ncorroborate the allegation.  I conclude allegation 2(b) for Applicant.\nAllegation 2(a) enumerates the security violations alleged at SOR 1(a), 1(b), 1(c),\n1(d) and 1(e) and alleges that those facts raise personal conduct concerns about\nApplicant\u2019s judgment and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. Allegations\n2(c) and 2(d) allege personal conduct that raises concerns about Applicant\u2019s judgment,\ntrustworthiness, reliability, and willingness to comply with rules and regulations.\nApplicant\u2019s conduct raises security concerns under Guideline E Disqualifying Conditions\n(DC) E2.A5.1.2.1. and DC E2.A5.1.2.4.   Applicant\u2019s personal conduct in failing to\n7\nacknowledge the conduct that led to his firing from Company A increases his\nvulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress.\nWe turn to an examination of possible Mitigating Conditions (MC) under the\nGuideline.  Because Applicant\u2019s former employer and associates provided information\nabout his unprofessional conduct that was substantiated and pertinent to a\ndetermination of his judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability, MC E2.A5.1.3.1 is\ninapplicable. \nThe conduct alleged in \u00b6 2(a) occurred in 1999 and 2000, but it demonstrated an\non-going pattern of inattentiveness and failure to follow rules and regulations for\nprotecting classified information. The conduct alleged in \u00b6\u00b6  2(c) and 2(d) occurred\nalmost 20 years ago, in 1987.  However, in his hearings, Applicant continued to justify\nhis conduct in 1987 and did not appear to understand why his employer fired him for\nfalsifying a roster by signing the names of individuals who did not meet the residency\nrequirement of the county in which the company-sponsored team would play. Further,\nApplicant presented the falsified roster to his employer for reimbursement of filing fees.\nApplicant offered two other reasons for his firing.  In 1989, two years after he was fired,\nhe opined that he was fired because his ex-wife was harassing him at work.  In 2007, at\nhis hearing on remand, he speculated that the company managers fired him in 1987\nbecause his engineering assessments \u201cdid not go along with [the company\u2019s]\ngeopolitical goal as a company.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s attempts to justify his actions that gave\nrise to his termination from Company A suggest that he has not taken positive steps to\ncome to terms with his conduct, a situation that continues to make him vulnerable to\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress.  Accordingly, I conclude that MC E2.A5.1.2.4. is not\napplicable.\n\n13\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to evaluating the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline, an administrative judge must thoroughly consider and review of all available\nreliable information about the appellant, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, to\narrive at a balanced decision.  Enclosure 2, \u00b6 E2.2.1 of the Adjudicative Guidelines\ndescribes this process of scrutiny and evaluation as \u201cthe whole person concept.\u201d  The\nfactors to be considered in a whole person analysis include the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; the frequency and recency of the conduct; the individual\u2019s\nage and maturity at the time of the conduct; the voluntariness of participation; the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; the\nmotivation for the conduct; the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress;\nand the likelihood for continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant completed a SF-171 in August 1989. He completed a SF-86 in\nDecember 1998 and another SF-86 in February 2006. These documents reveal that\nApplicant had a contentious relationship with his ex-wife and was incarcerated for three\ndays in 1988 for harassing her.  Eighteen years later, in 2006, when he completed his\nSF-86, he added a line stating that he would not recommend his former wife for a\nposition of trust, an observation that seemed beside the point when added to his\nsecurity clearance application.  Applicant\u2019s documents also show he was fired from jobs\nor left under threat of termination in 1987 (Employer A), 1989 (Employer B), and 2005\n(Employer C). Applicant provided several different reasons for his job terminations,\nsuggesting he had not assessed or come to terms with the conduct that led to the\nterminations. He explained that his firings occurred because his work was not\nappreciated or because individuals who reviewed his work did not think he performed\nhis job adequately.  He also speculated he was fired by Employer A in 1987 because his\nwife was harassing him at work.  He did not appear to accept the determination that\nEmployer A fired him for an ethics violation, even when the state unemployment\ncommission denied him benefits after finding he had been fired for violating his\nemployer\u2019s code of business and ethical conduct.  \nApplicant\u2019s personal conduct that led to the allegations of security violations\nsuggests a pattern of inattention to rules and procedures.  His lack of attention to the\ndetails of protecting classified information caused him to take actions that raised\nsecurity concerns under Guideline K. His present defense of his past unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations raises security concerns under Guideline E.\nIn ISCR Case No. 98-0761 at 3 (Dec. 27, 1999), DOHA\u2019s Appeal Board states\nthat an administrative judge, in deciding an applicant\u2019s security worthiness, \u201cmust\nconsider the record as a whole (Directive Section F.3.) and decide whether the\nfavorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\u201d I have\nconsidered the record as a whole and have evaluated Applicant\u2019s conduct under the\nwhole person concept of the Directive.  I conclude that the favorable evidence does not\noutweigh the unfavorable evidence and that Applicant has not demonstrated that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\n\n14\nFormal Findings\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline K: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e(1):\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e(2):\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e(3):\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.:   \nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2.

Clearance is denied.\nJoan Caton Anthony\nAdministrative Judge\n",

LEONARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nStephanie C. Hess, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2,\n1\n1992, as amended (Directive).\n See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (December\n29, 2005). \n2\nApplicant did not present sufficient evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the\ncumulative effect of his history of mishandling classified information, false statements and related\npersonal conduct, and criminal conduct. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense\n1\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on\nFebruary 7, 2007. The SOR\u2014which is equivalent to an administrative complaint\u2014details the factual\nbasis for the action and alleges a security concern under Guideline E for personal conduct, Guideline\nJ for criminal conduct, and Guideline K for handling protected information.  \nIn addition to the Directive, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nfor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by\nthe President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense\nDepartment, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive and Appendix 8 to DoD Regulation 5200.2-R. They apply to all\nadjudications and other determinations where an SOR has been issued on September 1, 2006, or\nthereafter.  Both the Directive and the Regulation are pending formal amendment. The Revised\n2\nGuidelines apply to this case because the SOR is dated February 7, 2007, which is after the effective\ndate. \n \nApplicant replied to the SOR on February 19, 2007, and requested a hearing. On February\n27 , he filed an amended reply to the SOR. The case was assigned to another administrative judge\nth\non May 9, 2007, who caused a notice of hearing to be issued scheduling the hearing for June 20,\n2007. The case was reassigned to me on June 9, 2007, due to a scheduling conflict. The hearing took\nplace as scheduled. DOHA received the hearing transcript on June 29, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nBased on his amended answer, Applicant admitted the factual allegations set forth in SOR\nsubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.h, and 2.a. He denied the remaining allegations. Based on the record\nevidence as a whole, I find the following facts:\n\n3\n1.\nIntroduction\nApplicant is a 39-year-old aeronautical engineer for an aerospace and defense company. He\nhas worked for this company since November 1999. He holds a bachelor\u2019s degree and will soon\ncomplete a master\u2019s degree in technical management. He has never been married and he has no\nchildren. At his job, he works on a program involving military fighter aircraft. He has a favorable\nwork history, as shown by the numerous letters of recommendation submitted by coworkers (Exhibit\nA). He is seeking to obtain a security clearance for his employment in the defense industry. \n2.\nApplicant\u2019s Mishandling of Classified Information during the 1980s\u20131990s\nFrom January 1986 to August 1995, Applicant served as a Sailor on active duty in the U.S.\nNavy. He achieved the rating of machinist\u2019s mate after completing nuclear field A school. When he\nwas honorably discharged from the Navy, he was a machinist\u2019s mate first class (paygrade E-6). \nIn about 1989, he was serving onboard an aircraft carrier. Like others on his ship, he kept\nclassified information in his locker/bunk area to study. This resulted in him accidentally removing\na 15 to 20-page classified training handout from the ship when he made a trip to visit his parents.\nThe handout was a hand-drawn schematic of reactor plant subsystems. He discovered the handout\nwhen he arrived at his parents\u2019 home. He did not report the matter, and intended to return the\nhandout to the ship. He forgot the handout at his parents\u2019 home. During the drive back to the ship,\nhe remembered the handout. He exited the interstate at the first opportunity and called his father. He\ntold his father to burn the handout in the fireplace. He felt comfortable asking his father to do this\nbecause his father had served in the U.S. Air Force and had held a security clearance. Applicant\nnever reported this incident to the Navy. \nIn about 1991 or 1992, while serving onboard the same ship, Applicant was, on short notice,\nput in charge of his department\u2019s technical library. He immediately started to inventory the classified\nmaterials and discovered a few manuals were missing. He did not report the missing manuals that\nnight, and he resumed his inventory the following morning thinking the manuals would likely turn\nup. The inventory was completed the next day and materials were still missing. He reported the\nmatter to his supervisor. An investigation was conducted. It resulted in the department\u2019s security\nofficer and his supervisor being reprimanded. He received a non-punitive letter of reprimand for his\nrole in the incident. Because the letter was not punitive, it did not become a part of his permanent\nmilitary record. The letter was not made part of the record evidence, and the factual basis for\nreprimand is unclear.  \nIn about 1992, while serving as the custodian of his department\u2019s technical library onboard\nthe aircraft carrier, he removed a classified schematic diagram of the nuclear power plant. He was\nrevising a technical manual and replaced the old schematic with the revised schematic. Instead of\ndestroying the old schematic, he kept it as a souvenir, hiding it under his bunk on the ship. When he\nwas reassigned in June 1992, he took the schematic with him. He kept the schematic for 18 months\nto 2 years until he decided he should not keep it any longer. He destroyed it by cutting it up, placing\nit in a bag, and putting it in the trash. Applicant never reported this incident to the Navy. \n3.\nApplicant\u2019s 1999 Extortion Charge  \n\n In deciding this case, I have not considered the results of any polygraph examinations. \n3\n4\nToward the end of his military service, Applicant enrolled at a nearby state military college.\nHe earned an associate\u2019s degree in August 1995, the same month he was discharged from the Navy.\nHe then enrolled at a prestigious state university to pursue his bachelor\u2019s degree, which he completed\nin May 1999. During this time, Applicant became involved with a woman and that relationship\neventually resulted in the extortion charge.\nApplicant met the woman in 1997 when she began cutting his hair. They dated for a period,\nbut then resumed a platonic friendship. The relationship ended in about January 1999 when\nApplicant decided to terminate their friendship and informed the woman of his decision. In February\n1999, Applicant was arrested on the extortion charge. The basis for the extortion charge was that the\nwoman alleged that Applicant had demanded money from her or he would tell her boyfriend they\nhad dated. Applicant was held in jail for a few hours until he posted bond. The case was set for trial\nuntil the prosecution elected to dismiss the charges. Applicant appeared in court on or about June\n14, 1999, and the court dismissed the charge. Applicant maintains the woman fabricated the charge.\n4.\nApplicant\u2019s 1999 Security-Clearance Application\nShortly after starting work with his current employer in 1999, Applicant was selected by his\ncompany to fill a contract position with another governmental agency (AGA). This position required\na top-secret  security clearance along with access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI). To\nobtain the clearance and SCI access, Applicant submitted a security-clearance application on\nDecember 1, 1999 (Exhibit 2). In signing the application, Applicant certified that his statements were\ntrue, complete, and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief and were made in good faith.\nAlso, he acknowledged that a knowing and willful false statement could be punished under federal\nlaw. \nOther than a number of foreign contacts, foreign travel, and the dismissed extortion charge,\nApplicant did not report anything of security significance. In particular, in response to Question 27\nabout illegal drug use, Applicant replied \u201cNo,\u201d meaning that he had not  illegally used any controlled\nsubstance in the last seven years. His answer to Question 27 was false because he was then using the\ndrug Ecstacy. He had used Ecstacy, in a social or party atmosphere, from July 1999 through\nNovember 1999. He continued using Ecstacy until about November 2000. He used it about twice a\nmonth during the six-month period of December 1999\u2013May 2000. Other than this period, he used\nit infrequently. He stopped using it due to feeling guilty about violating his employer\u2019s no-drug use\npolicy.\nBased on the 1999 security-clearance application, a background investigation was conducted.\nIn about May 2000, Applicant was required to take a polygraph examination.  He told the examiner\n3\nabout the non-punitive letter of reprimand. During the interview, he was asked if he had withheld\ninformation about mishandling classified information. Although he then did not remember the 1989\nincident set forth in SOR subparagraph 1.a, he did remember the 1992 incident set forth in SOR\nsubparagraph 1.c. He did not disclose it in response to the examiner\u2019s question. \nApplicant took a second polygraph examination about one month later in June 2000. During\nthe examination, the examiner accused Applicant of trying to manipulate the polygraph by\n\n I have relied heavily on Exhibit 7 in making my findings of fact. \n4\n5\ncontrolling his breathing (known as countermeasures). Applicant was not controlling his breathing,\nbut was flexing his sphincter muscle in an attempt to manipulate the polygraph. He learned about\nthis method by conducting research about the polygraph. He was doing this because he was lying\nabout his mishandling of classified information. He denied using any countermeasures and the\nexamination ended with an argument between Applicant and the examiner.\nTwo to three months later in about September 2000, Applicant was scheduled for his third\npolygraph examination. Applicant denies deliberately failing to disclose information about handling\nclassified information during this interview. He may have told the examiner about mishandling\nclassified information, but does not explicitly recall having done so.\nIn about January or February 2001, Applicant met for an interview with another investigator.\nIn this interview, he admitted that he had been lying about mishandling classified information. He\ndetailed his mishandling of classified information as described above. He also admitted to using\ncountermeasures (flexing his sphincter) during the polygraph examination. Based on these matters,\nthe AGA denied Applicant a security clearance in about August 2001.  \n5.\nApplicant\u2019s 2001 Security-Clearance Application\nA few months later in October 2001, Applicant completed a second security-clearance\napplication (Exhibit 1). In signing the application, Applicant certified that his statements were true,\ncomplete, and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief and were made in good faith. Also, he\nacknowledged that a knowing and willful false statement could be punished under federal law. \nIn response to Question 21 about his police record, Applicant reported the extortion charge.\nIn response to 27 about illegal drugs, Applicant reported using Ecstacy from about July 1999 to\nNovember 2000. He estimated his usage at 13 to 14 times. In response to Question 32 about his\ninvestigative record, he reported being denied a security clearance by AGA in August 2001. \nAnother background investigation was conducted based on the 2001 security-clearance\napplication. In a sworn statement, dated October 2002, Applicant described, among other things, the\ncircumstances surrounding the extortion charge and his use of Ecstacy (Exhibit 4). In a second sworn\nstatement, dated March 2003, he provided information about his family and friends who are foreign\nnationals (Exhibit 5). In a third sworn statement, dated August 2004, he provided information about\nthe denial of a security clearance in 2001 (Exhibit 6). \nIn a fourth sworn statement, dated December 2006, he gave a detailed, nine-page accounting\nof: (1) his association with relatives and friends who are foreign nationals; (2) his foreign travel; (3)\nhis military service; (4) his arrest for extortion; (5) his illegal drug involvement; and (6) the denial\nof a security clearance by AGA (Exhibit 7).  He admitted mishandling classified information and\n4\ntelling numerous lies trying to conceal it (Exhibit 7 at 8). He lied because he was fearful what would\nhappen to him if the admitted mishandling classified information. He pledged that he would never\nintentionally mishandle classified information in the future and would be truthful about all security\nmatters. In this regard, Applicant described his now positive attitude toward security matters for his\npresent employment duties (R. 95\u2013103).   \n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n5\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (App. Bd.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n11\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain that there\nth\nis no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases such as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n12\n6\nPOLICIES\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access\nto classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access\nto classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict\n5\nguidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  There is no\n6\npresumption in favor of granting or continuing access to classified information.  The government\n7\nhas the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been\ncontroverted.  An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or\n8\nmitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate burden\n9\nof persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.10\nNo one has a right to a security clearance.  As noted by the Supreme Court in Department\n11\nof Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the\n12\nDirective, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information\nwill be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\n\n Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\n13\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator,\n14\nsecurity official, competent medical authority, or other official government representative. \n7\nCONCLUSIONS\n1.\nThe Personal Conduct Security Concern \nThe concern under Guideline E is conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, which may raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of special\ninterest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process\nor any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe three incidents of mishandling classified information set forth in SOR subparagraphs 1.a,\n1.b, and 1.c under Guideline E are properly addressed under Guideline K, where they are also\nalleged. This is consistent with the change in the Revised Guidelines that eliminated the catch-all\ndisqualifying condition of any \u201creliable, unfavorable information\u201d from Guideline E. The current\nversion of Guideline E has more limited language, and includes conditions that relate to false\nstatements, or credible adverse information that is not sufficient to support action under another\nguideline. Here, the matters in subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c do not fall within any disqualifying\ncondition under the current version of Guideline E. On this basis, I find for Applicant on these\nsubparagraphs under Guideline E; however, they will be addressed under Guideline K. \nThe same logic applies to the denial of the security clearance by the AGA in 2001 as set forth\nin subparagraph 1.h. In my view, this matter does not fall within a disqualifying condition under\nGuideline E. On this basis, I find for Applicant on this subparagraph. But the denial is a relevant and\nmaterial fact that I have considered in deciding this case. \nTurning to the falsification allegations, the government has established its case under this\nguideline. He lied on his 1999 security-clearance application when he deliberately omitted,\nconcealed, or falsified relevant facts by denying any involvement with illegal drugs. He continued\nlying in May and June 2000 by deliberately providing false or misleading statements about his\nhistory of mishandling classified information in the Navy. Aggravating his false statements are his\nefforts to manipulate the polygraph examination in June 2000. I am not persuaded, however, that the\nevidence is sufficient to establish a falsification during the September 2000 interview as set forth in\nsubparagraph 1.g. \nAlthough he eventually cooperated and provided a full accounting of his conduct, it was only\nafter significant time and resources were expended. Given the false statements made when he\ncompleted the 1999 security-clearance application and during interviews in May and June 2000,\nboth DC 1  and DC 2  apply. \n13\n14\n\n Collecting or storing classified or other protected information at home or in any other unauthorized location.\n15\n Any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or other sensitive information. \n16\n8\nI reviewed the mitigating conditions under the guideline and conclude none apply. Making\ndeliberately false and misleading statements to the government during the security-clearance process\nis serious misconduct. It is not easily explained away, extenuated, or mitigated. \n2.\nThe Handling Protected Information Concern\nThe concern under Guideline K is that deliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules\nand regulations for protecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about an\nindividual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability to safeguard such\ninformation. As such, it is a bona fide security concern. \nThe government has established its case under this guideline. Applicant was involved in two\nincidents that raise concerns about his willingness and ability to properly handle and safeguard\nclassified information. \nThe incident in 1989 is of moderate concern because Applicant should have reported the\nincident as soon as he discovered that he had inadvertently taken the classified training handout to\nhis parents\u2019 home. He complicated the situation by forgetting it and then telling his father to destroy\nit without reporting the incident to the Navy. \nThe incident in 1991\u20131992 is of no concern. He was reprimanded for his role as the newly\nappointed custodian of the department\u2019s technical library. But the letter was not punitive, which\nindicates that he was not the root cause of the library\u2019s security problems. And because the basis for\nthe reprimand is unclear, this incident does not rise to the level of a security concern under the\nguideline. \nThe incident in 1992 presents the most serious concern. It was an intentional and knowing\nviolation when Applicant removed and kept the classified schematic. Taken together, the two\nincidents of concern paint a picture of Applicant as an individual who had a lax attitude toward\nhandling classified information. Given these circumstances, DC 2  and DC 7  apply.  \n15\n16\nI reviewed the mitigating conditions under the guideline and conclude Applicant receives\nsome credit. Each MC is summarized and discussed below.\nThe first MC\u2014so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so\ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and no longer casts\ndoubt on the individual\u2014applies in a limited fashion. The two incidents of concern took place when\nhe was in the Navy. This was many years ago when he was a relatively young Sailor, and that is no\nlonger the case. The credit in mitigation is limited, however, due to Applicant\u2019s efforts to conceal\nhis history of mishandling classified information.\nThe second MC\u2014the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security\ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward security\u2014does not apply. Although he  now\n\n9\nprofesses a positive attitude toward security, there is no evidence showing Applicant  had counseling\nor remedial security training.\nThe third MC\u2014the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training\u2014does\nnot apply. There is no evidence to support the conclusion that improper supervision or training\ncontributed to Applicant\u2019s two incidents of mishandling classified information. The fault was\nApplicant\u2019s on those two occasions. \n3.\nThe Criminal Conduct Security Concern\nThe concern under Guideline J is that criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nStarting with the 1999 extortion charge, the government has not established its case. Besides\nApplicant\u2019s testimony, the only evidence supporting this matter is the FBI Identification Record\n(Exhibit 3), which merely shows Applicant was arrested in February 1999 for extortion. Applicant\nclaims the charge was made up by a former girlfriend. The charge was dismissed or dropped a few\ndays before trial. Based on these facts, the evidence is insufficient to prove criminal conduct of any\nsecurity significance. \nIn addition to the extortion charge, the criminal conduct at issue here is making a false\nstatement within the jurisdiction of a federal agency in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 based on the\nfour falsification allegations (SOR subparagraphs 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g). Because I concluded that\nthree of the falsification allegations were substantiated, the criminal conduct concern under\nGuideline J is decided against Applicant as well. None of the mitigating conditions apply. Given the\ngravity of his misconduct, his evidence in reform and rehabilitation is insufficient to mitigate his\ncriminal conduct of making false statements to the federal government. \n4.\nConclusion\nI have also considered this case in light of the whole-person concept and conclude the\ndisqualifying evidence outweighs the mitigating evidence. In particular, I considered Applicant\u2019s\nhighly favorable letters of recommendation (Exhibit A). But I gave the letters less weight because\nnone of the individuals who wrote the letters were familiar with the nature of the allegations in this\ncase (R. 83). \nIn his closing argument, Applicant conceded that he has made mistakes in the past. He argues\nthat he has reformed during the last several years and this period should be enough to mitigate his\ncase (R. 118\u2013119). Although many years have passed since he mishandled classified information in\nthe Navy, and several years have passed since he lied on his security-clearance application in 1999\nand during interviews in 2000, the passage of time is not sufficient to mitigate the security concerns.\nThe record evidence shows Applicant was untruthful and dishonest during the security-clearance\nprocess. His multiple false statements and attempt to manipulate the investigative process is serious\nmisconduct. The seriousness of his misconduct continues to create a substantial doubt about his\nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Stated somewhat differently, the gravity of his\nmisconduct outweighs the favorable evidence.  \n\n10\nViewing the record evidence as a whole, I conclude Applicant did not present sufficient\nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the cumulative effect of his history of mishandling\nclassified information, false statements and related personal conduct, and criminal conduct. And\nApplicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nHere are my conclusions for each allegation in the SOR:\nSOR \u00b6 1\u2013Guideline E:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs a, b, c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs d, e, f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs g, h:\nFor Applicant\nSOR \u00b6 2\u2013Guideline J:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSOR \u00b6 3\u2013Guideline K:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph a:\nAgainst Applicant (on \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c)\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as\nadequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  Directive\n\u00b6  E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s findings\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S.\n607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give deference to the\nJudge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.32.1.  Applicant does not challenge the Judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact.  Therefore, they are not at issue in this appeal.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. V. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive  \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nThere is a presumption against granting a clearance.  Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399,\n1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government presents evidence\nth\nraising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish any appropriate mitigating\nconditions.  See Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions\nand whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006). \nIn analyzing the case, the Judge noted such favorable information as the fact that Applicant\nis a U.S. citizen by choice and has lived in this country for most of his adult life.  All his assets are\nin this country and he has held an interim clearance.  However, the Judge balanced those matters\nagainst the number of Applicant\u2019s close family members who reside in Sudan, the nature of the\nSudanese government and its relationship with the U.S., and                                                           \n                                                                                        , finally concluding that he is \u201cvulnerable to\npressure or duress from a foreign power.\u201d  We conclude that the Judge has articulated a rational basis\nfor concluding that Applicant had not met his burden of persuasion as to the application of mitigating\nconditions.  Furthermore, we conclude that his whole person analysis complies with the requirements\nof Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1, in that the Judge considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s conduct and\ncircumstances in reaching his decision.  See ISCR Case No. 04-09959 at 6 (App. Bd. May 19, 2006).\nFinally, we note that Applicant argued that Board precedent denied him due process of law.\nIn making this argument, he incorporated the Judge\u2019s own relatively lengthy survey of Board\nprecedent, which the Judge included in his decision.  Applicant also cites other cases by Hearing\n\n4\nOffice Judges which he believes support the granting of a clearance to him. We have considered\nApplicant\u2019s argument in light of the record as a whole.  We find no basis to conclude that he was\ndenied the due process provided him by the Directive and by Executive Order 10865.  Decisions of\nHearing Office Judges do not serve as mandatory authority for Board decisions.  See ISCR Case No.\n05-03143 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006).        \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision denying Applicant a clearance is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: Jeffrey D. Billett              \nJeffrey D.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nKathleen E. Voelker, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On August 12, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis\nfor that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.\n\nApplicant testified that he was 17 years old when he began consuming alcohol.  Tr. at 43.\n1\nThe Judge refers to this once incorrectly as \u201cintensive inpatient\u201d and once correctly as \u201cintensive outpatient.\u201d\n2\n2\nOn January 31, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge John Grattan Metz, Jr. denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive\n\u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether some of the Judge\u2019s findings, to\ninclude his negative credibility determination, were not supported by record evidence; and whether\nthe Judge\u2019s unfavorable clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no\nerror, we affirm.  \nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings: Applicant has a history of alcohol abuse\nfrom 1966 until July 2003, which includes five alcohol-related arrests.  He began drinking in high\nschool  and drank to excess and to the point of intoxication while in the Marines.\n1\nIn January 1987, Applicant was arrested for DUI, after having consumed 8 draft beers.  He\nwas convicted of negligent driving and fined.\nBetween July 1987 and July 1988, Applicant was assigned as a Marine to a remote location.\nHe began to abuse alcohol regularly, given the limited choices for social activity available to him.\nAlthough he lightened up on his drinking after his return, he began abusing alcohol again and, in\nMarch 1991, was arrested a second time for DUI.  This arrest was dismissed and expunged from his\nrecord.\nApplicant retired from the Marines in 1993, after which he increased his level of drinking.\nIn December 1994 he was again arrested for DUI, pleading guilty, paying a fine, spending a day in\njail, and being required to complete an alcohol safety action program (ASAP).  He completed the\nprogram in March 1995.  \nApplicant resumed drinking after completing ASAP and was arrested again for DUI, in\nDecember 1996.  Again he pled guilty, was fined, received a suspended sentence to 60 days\nconfinement, and was ordered to attend another ASAP, and to attend two Alcoholics Anonymous\n(AA) meetings per week for a year.  He completed ASAP successfully.  \nIn September 1999, Applicant was arrested for another DUI.  Upon the advice of counsel he\nattended an alcohol treatment program, which lasted from November 1999 to January 2000.   He was\n2\ndiagnosed as alcohol dependent.  He was indicted on felony DUI, due to the fact that it was his third\nDUI in a five year period.  Applicant pled guilty.  He was sentenced to five years imprisonment and\nto a fine, although all but two months of the imprisonment was suspended, conditioned on good\nbehavior for five years, indefinite supervised probation, and completion of the alcohol treatment\naftercare program.  \nApplicant completed his prison sentence in September 2000 and was released from\nsupervised probation in July 2001.  He attended AA meetings until \u201cat least July 2001,\u201d after which\nthe Judge found that evidence of Applicant\u2019s AA attendance is contradictory.  The Judge also noted\n\nTr. at 53-4.\n3\nTr. at 54.  \n4\nApplicant admitted that, during his alcohol treatment program, he was diagnosed as \u201calcohol dependent\u201d and\n5\nthat at the time of the treatment he thought he was an alcoholic.  However, he went on to state that he does not \u201cright\nnow\u201d consider himself to be an alcoholic and that, in fact, no one had ever explicitly said to him that he was.  Tr. at 68-9.\nWhile he never used the word \u201crecant\u201d or other similar term, a reasonable person could infer that Applicant\u2019s testimony\nwas an attempt to discount his diagnosis.     \n3\ncertain apparent inconsistencies in Applicant\u2019s evidence.  For example,  although Applicant admitted\nin his response to the SOR that he had been diagnosed as alcohol dependent, he testified that he had\nnever explicitly received such a diagnosis.   Additionally, Applicant testified that he did not drink\n3\nalcohol from his 1999 arrest until December 2002,  which is not consistent with Government Exhibit\n4\n3, in which he states that he had been using alcohol occasionally during the year and a half preceding\nhis making of that document, June 23, 2003. \nAlthough Applicant testified that he does not consider himself to be an alcoholic, he\nacknowledged that counselors at his treatment program advised him to abstain from drinking\nalcohol.  Nevertheless, Applicant continues to consume alcohol, although he states that he has\nchanged his lifestyle and can control his drinking.  \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d\nDirective  \u00b6  E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s findings from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v.

We have examined the challenged\nfindings in light of the record as a whole.   As regards the first, we note that Applicant\u2019s answer to\nthe SOR admitted that he had \u201cconsumed alcohol, at times to excess and to the point of intoxication,\nfrom approximately 1966 to at least June 23, 2003.\u201d  Furthermore, we note Government Exhibit 2,\na signed an sworn statement by Applicant, in which he says, \u201cI started drinking when I was 17 years\nold.  I went to parties on weekends and would drink about a six-pack.\u201d  These admissions, read in\nlight of Applicant\u2019s DUI arrests and other evidence of alcohol abuse, constitute substantial evidence\nfor the challenged finding.  As regards the remaining two, they are located in the Conclusions section\nof the decision and are evaluative comments based upon a plausible interpretation of the record\nevidence.  To the extent that there is error in them, it is harmless, given the record as a whole.   See,\n5\ne. g., ISCR Case No. 04-00949 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2007).  During the course of challenging the\nsufficiency of the Judge\u2019s decision, Applicant also took issue with the following statement:  \u201cIn\n1982, Applicant experienced a period of increased alcohol consumption when his wife died of cancer\n. . .\u201d  Decision at 2.  After examining the record, we conclude that Applicant\u2019s position on this\n\nDecision at 8.  \n6\n4\nstatement has merit.  This particular finding is erroneous.  However, given the record as a whole, we\nconclude that the error is harmless.  We will address the Judge\u2019s credibility determination below. \nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs.

Once the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish any\nappropriate mitigating conditions.  See Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more\nof them apply to the particular facts of a case.

Dec. 20, 2006). \nWe have considered Applicant\u2019s brief, the Judge\u2019s findings, and the record as a whole.  Given\nApplicant\u2019s lengthy history of alcohol abuse, his five DUI arrests, his having continued to drink\ndespite his counselors having advised him to abstain, and the apparent discrepancies the Judge noted\nin Applicant\u2019s evidence, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant had not met his burden of persuasion\nis sustainable.   Furthermore, the record does not support a conclusion that Applicant has met his\n\u201cheavy burden\u201d in challenging the Judge\u2019s credibility determination.  See ISCR Case No. 97-0356\n(App. Bd. Apr. 21, 1998).  In addition to the above-referenced discrepancies, the Judge also noted\nthe self serving character of Applicant\u2019s statements to investigators concerning his DUI arrests, to\nthe effect that, on the dates in question, his driving was erratic due not to intoxication but to his\nefforts to avoid potholes in the road, etc.  In light of these matters, and the record as a whole, the\nJudge\u2019s view that Applicant suffers from \u201cgeneral credibility issues\u201d  is sustainable.  Accordingly,\n6\nthe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\n\n5\nOrder \nThe Judge\u2019s decision denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.  \nSigned: Michael Y.

On November 5, 2004, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct), of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On June 16, 2006, after the hearing,\n\n2\nAdministrative Judge Jacqueline T. Williams denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the delay of approximately one year\nbetween the hearing on Applicant\u2019s case and the issuance of the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision,\nwhich caused a subsequent delay in Applicant\u2019s ability to reapply for a security clearance, is\narbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  \nApplicant claims that he has been harmed by the delay in the issuance of the Administrative\nJudge\u2019s security clearance decision because if he had a clearance he would have been eligible for a\npromotion which would increase his pay by $500 per month.  He notes that an applicant can reapply\nfor a clearance one year after an adverse decision is issued.  In Applicant\u2019s case, the hearing was held\non June 7, 2005.  Therefore, if the adverse decision in his case had been issued in what Applicant\nconsiders a timely manner, in the summer of 2005, he could have reapplied for a security clearance\none year later, in the summer of 2006.  Since the decision was issued on June 16, 2006, Applicant\ncannot reapply until June 2007.  Applicant requests that the Appeal Board issue a nunc pro tunc\norder amending the date of the Administrative Judge\u2019s order to August 16, 2005, and award further\nrelief as the Board deems appropriate.\nApplicant cites no authority in support of the requested relief.  The Board has no supervisory\nauthority over Hearing Office Judges and no basis to assume how large an individual Judge\u2019s\ncaseload may be.  There is no basis in the record to conclude that the Judge processed Applicant\u2019s\ncase in a way that would constitute error.  Without a showing of identifiable prejudice to the\nappealing party, delay in the processing of a case does not warrant a finding of error.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 04-06517 at 3 (Oct. 21, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10880 at 4 (June 24, 2005); ISCR Case\nNo. 02-32581 at 3 (June 9, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-20005 at 3 (May 17, 2005).  \nWhile Applicant claims to have been harmed by the delay in the issuance of a security\nclearance decision, the harm he cites\u2014his failure to be promoted and a delay in his ability to reapply\nfor a security clearance\u2014is ancillary to the purposes of a DOHA hearing.  In any event, information\nabout Applicant\u2019s job which was not introduced at the hearing also constitutes new evidence, which\nthe Board cannot consider on appeal.  See Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Moreover, since no one has a right\nto a security clearance, the outcome of any subsequent security clearance application Applicant\nmight submit is speculative.  \nConcerning our authority to modify the date of the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision, we are\nlimited in the remedies which we may award.  In cases in which a Judge has committed harmful\nerror, we may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision or remand the case to the Judge for further consideration.\nThese are the only remedies which the Directive makes available to us.  Harmful error may occur\nin the following ways: if (1) the Judge\u2019s findings of fact are not based upon substantial evidence; (2)\nthe Judge failed to adhere to procedures required by the Executive Order or the Directive; and/or (3)\nthe Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.33.  In this case,\nApplicant has not established, or even claimed, harmful error as defined by the Directive.  Therefore,\nApplicant has not met his burden of showing that the case should be reversed or remanded.  Having\nfailed in his burden, Applicant is not entitled to relief.     \n\n3\nOrder\nThe Administrative Judge\u2019s decision denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D.

MOGUL\nAPPEARANCES\n\n2\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJennifer I. Goldstein, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nEllen J. Wang, Esq.\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant, a 60 year old computer engineer, was born in the People\u2019s Republic of China\n(PRC), came to the United States in 1968 and became a U. S. citizen in 1977.  His wife and  three\nchildren are also United States citizens. His father and three siblings are citizens and residents of\nTaiwan, and his  father -in-law is a citizen and resident of the PRC. Applicant\u2019s strong attachment\nto the U.S. and long history here make it unlikely that he would respond favorably to any efforts to\nact against U. S. interests. Additionally, Applicant knowingly violated his former employer\u2019s rules\nby using his company computer to access and download pornographic materials, causing Applicant\nto be terminated from his place of employment. This conduct occurred for a period of approximately\none and one half weeks, almost five years ago, and there is little likelihood that it will occur in the\nfuture. Mitigation has been shown. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn December 20, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could\nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and recommended referral\nto an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nIn a signed and sworn statement, dated January 21, 2005, Applicant responded in writing to\nthe SOR allegations. He requested a clearance decision based on a hearing record.\nOn November  25, 2005, this case was assigned to this Administrative Judge to conduct a\nhearing and issue a written decision. A Notice of Hearing was issued to the parties on January 5,\n2006,  and the hearing was conducted on January 31, 2006.\nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered nine documentary exhibits (Government\nExhibits 1 through 9), and no witnesses were called. Applicant offered one documentary exhibit\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A), and also submitted a Hearing Memorandum,  and offered his testimony and\nthat of his wife, son and daughter.  The transcript (Tr) was received on February 13, 2006. \n\n3\nThe Government appealed my original Decision, which was dated February 22, 2006. The\nAppeal Board has remanded that Decision and instructed me to consider all the record evidence, and\nmake findings \u201cconcerning the PRC\u2019s \u2018well documented abuses of human rights in violation of\ninternationally recognized norms,\u2019 including \u2018intolerance of dissent\u2019 and inadequate \u2018legal safeguards\nfor basic freedoms.\u201d The Appeal Board also remanded because my Decision did not \u201cmake a finding\nconcerning the Taiwanese government\u2019s efforts at industrial espionage.\u201d This has been done in this\nremand decision. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline M (Misuse of\nInformation Technology Systems)of the Directive. The SOR contains five allegations, 1.a. through\n1.e., under Guideline B, two allegations, 2.a. and 2.b., under Guideline E, and one allegation, 3.a.,\nunder Guideline M. Applicant completely admitted SOR allegations 1.a., 1.b., 1.d., and 1.e. The\nadmitted allegations are incorporated herein as Findings of Fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including Applicant's\nAnswer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony, and upon due consideration of that\nevidence, I make the following Findings of Fact: \nApplicant is a 60 year old software engineer, employed by a defense contractor, he seeks a\nDoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector. He first received\na security clearance in 1986, and he retained it until the present time with a gap in 1991 during a\nbrief period of unemployment. \nApplicant was born in the PRC in 1945 and moved to Taiwan in 1949, where he received a\nBachelor of Science Degree in 1968. He came to the United States in 1968, and became a naturalized\nUnited States citizen in 1977. He received a Ph.D. degree in mathematics from a United States\nuniversity in 1972.  \nApplicant\u2019s wife, to whom he has been married since 1971, was also born in PRC and moved\nto Taiwan in1946 at the age of one year. She came to the United States in 1969 and  became a United\nStates citizen in 1977.  Applicant and his wife have three adult children, a son and two daughters,\nall of whom were born in the United States. Applicant, his wife, and children are solely United States\ncitizens.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B  - Foreign Influence)\nApplicant\u2019s father is a citizen and  resident of Taiwan. He is 89 and has been retired for many\nyears. He was a civil engineer and worked for a company, which was under the control of the\nTaiwanese Government. He received a lump sum payment for a pension from the company. \n\n4\nApplicant also has a brother and two sisters, who are citizens and residents of Taiwan.  His\nbrother is a retired colonel form the Taiwanese Air Force, who worked as a civil engineer. He now\nbuilds golf courses. Applicant\u2019s older sister is a retired school teacher. His younger sister is a retired\nbanker. His brother and possibly his sister receive pensions from the Taiwanese Government. \nApplicant e-mails pictures of his grandchild four or five times a year to his brother who then\nsends them to his father. Applicant receives pictures back approximately the same frequency.\nApplicant telephones his father approximately two times a year on birthdays and holidays. He only\nspeaks to his brother and sisters if they are at his father\u2019s home when he calls. \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law  resides in the PRC. Applicant never communicates with him by\ntelephone, and he last saw him during his one trip to the PRC in 2001.\nApplicant last traveled to Taiwan on two occasions in 2004, once to visit his ailing mother\nand the second time to attend her funeral.  Previously, he traveled to Taiwan in 2000, twice in 1998,\n1997, 1996, and twice in 1994, primarily to visit his parents. He has also traveled to many other\ncountries for pleasure, He always follows the proper procedure of informing his company security\noffice before his trip and debriefing after he returns. \nApplicant does not have any current financial interest in Taiwan, nor does he does he\nanticipate inheriting any property there. He estimates that his home and other financial holdings in\nthis country are worth $2 million.\nCurrent Status of Taiwan and the PRC\nIn writing my initial decision, I considered all of the evidence presented in the case regarding\nthe current status of Taiwan and the PRC, and how it may affect Applicant and this case, although\nnot all of it was discussed in the decision.  It will be reviewed and discussed in more detail in this\nremand decision. \nTaiwan has an elected democratic government. It has the 17  largest economy that is a\nth\nleading producer of high-technology goods. It engages in industrial and economic espionage.\nProprietary information technology is high on the Taiwanese list of targeted information to be\nacquired by their agents from foreign governments and businesses. There are 23 million Taiwanese\ncitizens. Their per capita income in 2005 was $15,000, cited by their president in a speech that he\npresented as economic progress under his administration. Although the United States now recognizes\nTaiwan as part of the PRC as \u201cone-China\u201d it continues to maintain strong unofficial relations with\nTaiwan (Exhibits 7 and 8).\nThe PRC, the most populous country in the world, is economically powerful, and is an\nimportant trading partner of the United States. It is run by the Communist Party which controls all\naspects of the PRC government. It has strong military forces, and has its own foreign-policy.\nAlthough there has been some cooperation, there has been much more conflict with the United States\n\n5\nin the past. The PRC has an extremely large army, a sophisticated defense establishment, and space\ncapability. The PRC has launched satellites, has ballistic missiles, has nuclear arms, and nuclear\nbombs. Its diplomatic and military dispute with the Republic of China (Taiwan), foreshadows a\npossible military conflict, which the United States opposes as a resolution of the conflict. The PRC\nhas an abysmal human rights record, which includes arbitrary killings; detention or incarceration\nwithout notice in mental facilities; torture; arbitrary arrest, detention or exile; no right to a public,\nfair trial; a politically controlled judiciary; lack of due process; restrictions on free speech, on\nreligious freedom, on freedom of travel, on freedom of assembly; and no rights of privacy - family,\nhome or correspondence. \nThe PRC engages in espionage against the United States through an extensive network of\nbusinesses, personnel, and specific programs designed to acquire advanced U.S. military technology.\nOne approach is to covertly conduct espionage by personnel from government ministries,\ncommissions, institutes, and military industries, independently of the PRC intelligence services. This\nis believed to be the major method of PRC intelligence activity in the United States. It also tries to\nidentify ethnic Chinese in the United States who have access to sensitive information, and sometimes\nis able to enlist their cooperation in illegal technology information transfers (Exhibits 6 and 8).\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because\nhe exhibited conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. \nOn April 5, 2001, and May 1, 2001, to May 9, 2001, Applicant accessed sexually explicit\nweb sites from his company owned computer and downloaded sexually explicit photographs onto\na hard drive. This conduct was in direct violation of his employer\u2019s company policy as established\nin Exhibits 2 and 3. Applicant testified that, while he was not aware of the specific restrictions in\nExhibits 2 and 3, he was aware that accessing pornographic documents on his company computer\nwas not allowed. Applicant\u2019s contended that he stop accessing the sites before he was confronted,\nand no evidence has been introduced to contradict his claim.\nExhibit 4 is an Adverse Information Report from his former employer, dated July 25, 2001,\nwhich indicates that Applicant was terminated for cause on July 3, 2001. At the hearing, Applicant\nstrongly asserted that he was not terminated, but rather given the opportunity to retire, which he\nclaimed to have done. Applicant  did concede, however, that he left his employment after 15 years,\nunder less than favorable circumstances. \nParagraph 3 (Guideline M - Misuse of Technology Systems) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because\nof Applicant\u2019s noncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations pertaining to\ninformation technology systems. This allegation is based on the fact discussed in Paragraph 2, above,\nwhere Applicant knowingly violated his employer\u2019s rules, procedures and guidelines, by using his\n\n6\ncompany computer to access and download pornographic materials. \nMitigation\nApplicant submitted four  letters of reference (Exhibit A). The first letter, dated January 23,\n2006,  is from a Senior Director of his former employer, who has known Applicant since 1969, and\nrecruited him in 1986. Applicant worked for him in various capacities for 15 years. He stated that\nApplicant, \u201cworks hard and devotes extra hours to his work, most of which are uncompensated. He\nhas met all of the program expectations in an outstanding manner.\u201d  He also added that Applicant,\n\u201cestablishes high standards for himself and earns respects (sic) from his teammates and customers.\nHe has integrity in the work he does and handles classified material carefully. I highly recommend\nhim.\u201d\nThe second letter, dated January 25, 2006,  is from an individual who has known Applicant\nsince 1981, when they were both college professors, and they subsequently worked together for many\nyears at his previous place of employment. In his letter he commented that Applicant, \u201cis a loyal\nAmerican and a person of good moral character.\u201d \nThe third letter, dated January 21, 2006, is from an individual who has been Applicant\u2019s \nsupervisor at his current place of employment since 2001. He described Applicant as a \u201cdedicated\nemployee with excellent work ethics. [Applicant] has adhered to all our project security guidelines\nand has a \u2018spotless\u2019 security record with no violations or infractions. . . . I find [ Applicant] to be a\nfully trustworthy American who understands and complies with his security obligations.\u201d\nThe final letter, dated January 24, 2006, is from a co-worker since 2001, who also strongly\nrecommends Applicant as a trustworthy individual.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines that must be carefully\nconsidered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and making the overall common sense\ndetermination required. The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or\nmitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.\nAlthough the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not\ndeterminative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be\nmeasured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of\nseriousness, recency, motivation, etc. \nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as\nto whether a person is an acceptable security risk.\n\n7\nEach adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and the extent of\nknowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age\nand maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or\nabsence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2). \nBURDEN OF PROOF\n              Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.\nIf the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to Applicant to establish\nhis security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to\ndemonstrate that, despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of Applicant's\nfitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration\nof such factors as the recency and frequency of the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of\nrecurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the\nGovernment raise doubts about Applicant's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, Applicant has\na heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted\nby the United States Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988),\n\"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\"\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and\nfactors, I conclude the following with respect to Guidelines B, E, and M: \n(Guideline B -Foreign Influence)\nUnder Guideline B, a security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family,\nincluding cohabitants, and other persons to whom he is bound by affection, influence or obligation,\nare not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. Based on the evidence of record,\nthe Government has established an initial  reason to deny Applicant a security clearance because of\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence).\nApplicant\u2019s father, his brother and two sisters are citizens and residents of Taiwan, and his\nfather-in-law is a citizen and resident of the PRC. The citizenship and residency of Applicant's\n\n8\nfamily create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified\ninformation because it makes Applicant potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.\nThe possession of such ties raises a security concern sufficient to require Applicant to present\nevidence in rebuttal, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet his burden of persuasion that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him. This\nApplicant has done. \n  The evidence of Applicant\u2019s family members, who are citizens and residents of Taiwan and\nthe PRC comes within Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A2.1.2.1, \u201cimmediate family members, or\npersons to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, who are citizens of, or\nresident in, a foreign country.\u201d\nI have also considered the two countries involved in this case in making my original decision\nand in this remand. Regarding Taiwan, there is a connection between Applicant and his family in\nTaiwan. While Taiwan\u2019s position is not as adversarial to the United States as the PRC, it is a country\nthat practices industrial espionage. However, none of Applicant\u2019s family are agents of Taiwan, and\nthere is no current connection between any of Applicant\u2019s family and Taiwan\u2019s government. Overall,\nthe record evidence does not indicate that any of Taiwan\u2019s practices would cause Applicant to be less\nthan totally loyal to the United States.\nThe PRC, with an interest inimical to the United States, must be scrutinized in great detail.\nHowever, the connection between Applicant\u2019s family in that country and Applicant is minimal. As\ndiscussed above, Applicant\u2019s only relative in  the PRC is his father-in-law. Applicant\u2019s contact with\nhim is extremely limited, as he  never communicates with him by telephone, and he last saw him\nduring his one trip to the PRC in 2001. While I certainly considered in my original decision and\ncontinue to understand that the PRC, which engages in human rights violations, could potentially\nplace threats against Applicant\u2019s father-in-law in an attempt to coerce Applicant, the evidence\nstrongly suggests that no such threat would  cause Applicant to act in a way that would be contrary\nto the interest of the United States.\nThe primary factors in mitigation that I have considered include: Applicant\u2019s long history\nsince coming to the United States in 1968 and becoming a United  States citizen in 1977, his wife\nbecoming a citizen a United States citizen in 1977, his devotion to his wife and his three children,\nwho are also United States citizens; his limited contact with his family outside of the United States,\nhis considerable net worth in the United States, Applicant\u2019s strong feelings concerning his devotion\nto this country, and finally the strong recommendations he received from co-workers and a\nsupervisor.  These extremely, strong factors in mitigation overcome the adverse considerations of\nTaiwan and the PRC.\nBased on the nature of the overall record and the totality of the evidence, I have determined\nthat his family in Taiwan and the PRC do not constitute an unacceptable security risk, and the\nMitigating Condition (MC) E2.A2.1.3.1, \u201ca determination that the immediate family member(s) .\n. . in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power\nin a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the\n\n9\nUnited States,\u201d applies. \n \n        \nAfter considering all of the evidence of record on this issue, I conclude that the mitigating\nevidence substantially outweighs the evidence supporting the SOR, and even in the event pressure\nwas exerted upon Applicant to compromise classified information, he would resist it and would\nreport the incident to the proper authorities. \n(Guideline E - Personal Conduct) \nWith respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant did exhibit conduct\ninvolving questionable judgment, and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, but I do\nnot find that controlling.\nIn reviewing the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline E,  I conclude that DC\nE2.A5.1.2.5, a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, applies because Applicant knowingly and\nwilfully violated his employer\u2019s policy by accessing pornographic websites.  However, in mitigation,\nthis conduct occurred for a period of approximately one and one half weeks, almost five years ago,\nand based on Applicant\u2019s testimony and the letter of reference from his current supervisor, I find that\nthere is little likelihood that it will occur in the future.  I resolve Guideline E for Applicant.\n(Guideline M - Misuse of Technology Systems)\nAs to Guideline M, the evidence establishes that Applicant was noncompliant with rules\nprocedures, guidelines or regulations pertaining to information technology systems, but again\nApplicant has overcome this conduct. \nIn reviewing the DCs under Guideline M,  I conclude that DC E2.A13.1.2.1, illegal or\nunauthorized entry into any information technology system, and DC E2.A13.1.2.4., introduction of\nmedia into any information technology system without authorization, when specifically prohibited\nby rules, procedures, and guidelines, applies. However, I find that MC E2.A13.1.3.1., the misuse was\nnot recent is applicable to this case.

Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on November 19, 2002, and \nhe was granted an interim clearance. On March 25, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the \nbasis for its preliminary decision to deny his application, citing security concerns under \nGuidelines M and E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. Applicant\u2019s interim \nclearance was withdrawn in November 2007. \nNovember 20, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 28, 2008; and he requested a decision on \nthe record without a hearing. After the File of Relevant Material was sent to Applicant, \nhe retained an attorney. On September 3, 2008, his attorney requested a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel was ready to proceed on September 15, 2008, and the case was \nassigned to me on the same day. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on September 18, \n2008, scheduling the hearing for October 16, 2008. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 and 2 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) \nA through E, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) \non October 22, 2008.  \n \nI granted Department Counsel\u2019s request to keep the record open until October \n27, 2008, to submit a memorandum of law pertaining to the statutes, regulations, \ndirectives, or rules that may have been violated by the conduct alleged under Guideline \nM. I received Department Counsel\u2019s memorandum on October 27, 2008, and \nApplicant\u2019s response to the memorandum on November 7, 2008. They are attached to \nthe record as Hearing Exhibits I and II. \n \nProcedural Matters \n \n \nOn my own motion, I amended SOR \u00b6 1, without objection of either party, to \ninsert the verb that was omitted from the second sentence. As amended, the word \n\u201cinclude\u201d is added after the third word of the second sentence (Tr. 10). The amendment \nis handwritten on the SOR. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n2.b. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old senior systems engineer employed by a federal \ncontractor. He has worked for his current employer since November 2002. His duties \ninvolve installing and maintaining access control systems for government buildings (Tr. \n23). He was married in November 1997, owns his home, and has three children, ages \nseven, three, and two.  \n \n \nApplicant applied for a job with a federal agency in 2002, and he disclosed his \nillegal file swapping to a security investigator (GX 2 at 2). On October 25, 2007, he \nsubmitted a signed and sworn statement to another security investigator in which he \ndiscussed his involvement in illegal file swapping (GX 2). He testified he was \nuncomfortable during this interview, but nothing in his sworn statement was untrue. He \nfelt, however that some clarification of his statement was needed. He used his response \nto the SOR and his testimony at the hearing to clarify some parts of his statement (Tr. \n27).  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nIn his sworn statement, Applicant defined illegal file swapping as \u201cdownloading \nfiles or programs without paying for the license.\u201d He admitted illegal file swapping from \n1993, when he was in college, until October 20, 2007, when he downloaded a serial \nnumber for a multimedia program and used it to unlock the program and view a movie \ntrailer. The serial number would have cost $29.99 if purchased, but Applicant was able \nto download it without paying for it.  \n \nApplicant told the security investigator the computer sites he used were \u201ctoo \nnumerous to list.\u201d He admitted illegal file swapping about once a month, except for a six-\nmonth period of unemployment from May to November 2002, when he engaged in file \nswapping about twice a week. At the hearing, he testified he looked for files to download \nabout once a month, but did not download something every month.  \n \nThe materials illegally downloaded included anti-virus programs, word processing \nprograms, games, movies, and miscellaneous study guides, certifications, \u201ccheat \nsheets\u201d for games, and manuals for products. He eventually purchased some of the \nmovies and games he had downloaded. He estimated the total value of programs he \nhad illegally downloaded to be between $750 and $1,000. He told the investigator he \nplanned \u201cto do less\u201d illegal file downloading and he hoped that \u201csomeday\u201d he would stop \nit completely. At the hearing, he testified he had not illegally downloaded anything since \nOctober 2007 and did not intend to do it again (Tr. 49). \n \nApplicant testified he had never sold or profited from anything he downloaded \n(Tr. 34). He admitted that, even though the law in the early 1990s was \u201cvery gray,\u201d he \nknew \u201cfrom a moral perspective\u201d it was wrong to download programs without paying for \nthem (Tr. 46). \n \n \nIn his statement, Applicant also admitted that in 1999 he and two coworkers stole \ncomputer equipment from a former employer while moving equipment to a different \nlocation. He did not know what his coworkers took, but he personally took four memory \nsticks worth $25 to $50 each, a central processing unit chip worth $100 to $120, and a \nvideo card worth $75 to $100. The equipment was old and not intended for further use \nby his employer (Answer at 2). In his answer to the SOR and at the hearing, Applicant \nstated he would not have stolen the equipment if his coworkers had not approached him \nwith the idea and if the likelihood of getting caught had not been remote (Answer at 2; \nTr. 50). \n \n \nApplicant submitted performance appraisals from his current employer for his two \nprevious rating periods. For the period ending in May 2008 (AX B), he was rated \n\u201coutstanding\u201d in independence; and \u201cexcellent\u201d in technical skill, work quality, and \ndependability, on a five-level scale ranging from \u201coutstanding\u201d to \u201cpoor.\u201d For the period \nending in November 2006 (AX A), he was rated \u201coutstanding\u201d in dependability and \nindependence; and \u201cexcellent\u201d in technical skill, work quality, and productivity. In August \n2007, he was promoted to be an area operations manager (Tr. 36). \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant presented a statement from his director of operations (AX C), who \ndescribed him as \u201ca person of high moral character and judgment.\u201d A physical security \nspecialist for the U.S. Secret Service who has worked with Applicant for two years \nconsiders him \u201ca person worthy of trust and confidence,\u201d whose integrity has never \nbeen in question (AX D). Another Secret Service employee who has worked with \nApplicant for six years considers him trustworthy and reliable (AX E).  \n \nApplicant testified his current employer was aware of his file swapping activities \nbut not the theft of computer equipment (Tr. 37). His supervisor\u2019s first reaction when \ninformed of the illegal file sharing was \u201cyou\u2019ve got to be kidding me,\u201d because his \nsupervisor believed none of their employees would have a clearance if illegal file \nsharing were a disqualifying factor (Tr. 54). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology Systems \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant \u201cillegally downloaded software, serial numbers, \ngames, study guides, manuals, and movies\u201d from 1993 until \u201cat least\u201d October 20, 2007 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a); and that he intends to continue his illegal downloading (SOR \u00b6 1.b). The \nsecurity concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 39 as follows:  \nNoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \nand information. Information Technology Systems include all related \ncomputer hardware, software, firmware, and data used for the \ncommunication, transmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or \nprotection of information. \nThree disqualifying conditions under this guideline are potentially relevant. The \ndisqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 40(a) is raised by \u201cillegal or unauthorized entry into any \ninformation technology system or component thereof.\u201d AG \u00b6 40(c) is raised by \u201cuse of \nany information technology system to gain unauthorized access to another system or to \na compartmented area within the same system.\u201d AG \u00b6 40(f) is raised by \u201cintroduction, \nremoval, or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, or media to or from any \ninformation technology system without authorization, when prohibited by rules, \nprocedures, guidelines, or regulations.\u201d The phrase \u201cany information technology system\u201d \nindicates that this guideline applies to privately-owned systems as well as government \n\n \n6 \n \n \nsystems. See ISCR Case No. 99-0054, 2000 WL 1247735 (App. Bd. Jul. 24, 2000) \n(Guideline M covers misuse of government computers or private computers). \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 40(a) and (c) both involve \u201cunauthorized\u201d entry or access. There is no \nevidence Applicant entered any system illegally or without authorization. Instead, it \nshows he entered systems available to the public, but was able to bypass the licensing \nrequirements and download games, software, music, videos, and publications without \npaying for them. Thus, AG \u00b6\u00b6 40(a) and (c) are not raised. \n \n \nThe issue under AG \u00b6 40(f) is whether Applicant downloaded and copied \nsoftware or media \u201cwithout authorization, when prohibited by rules, procedures, \nguidelines, or regulations.\u201d Department Counsel submitted no evidence of rules, \nprocedures, guidelines, or regulations at the hearing, but she submitted a memorandum \nof law after the hearing, arguing that Applicant was guilty of copyright violations as well \nas larceny under state law. In response to Department Counsel\u2019s post-hearing \nsubmission, Applicant submitted a memorandum arguing that the government failed to \nprove a violation of any rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations. Attached to \nApplicant\u2019s submission was a legal treatise tracing the changes in copyright law \ntriggered by the widespread practice of downloading and recording media from the \ninternet: Niels B. Schumann, Direct Infringement on Peer-to-Peer Networks, William \nMitchell College of Law, Legal Studies Research Paper Series, Working Paper No. 9, \nApril 2005, available at http://ssrn.com/abstract=703882 (hereinafter referred to as \n\u201cSchumann\u201d). \n \nThe Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 106, et seq., vests certain exclusive rights in the \nowner of a copyright. The Act also recognizes that fair use of copyrighted material is not \nan infringement of the copyright. Fair use is not statutorily defined, except by illustrative \nexamples, \u201csuch as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple \ncopies for classroom work), scholarship, or research.\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 107. The \ndevelopment of the law regarding \u201cfair use\u201d is complex and evolving. In A&M Records, \nInc. v. Napster, Inc., 239 F.3d 1004 (9th Cir.2001), the Ninth Circuit affirmed a trial court \ndecision that about 75 million users were infringing copyright by exchanging music files \nvia a peer-to-peer network. Napster involved a network in which each user became a \ndistributor because the user\u2019s computer became a server accessible to other users. \nRecording music for personal, noncommercial use is statutorily recognized as protected \nfrom infringement actions by the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n1008); See Schumann at 5. Similarly, recording movies on a videocassette recorder for \npersonal, noncommercial use was recognized by the Supreme Court as fair use in Sony \nCorporation of America v. Universal City Studios, 464 U.S. 417, 442 (1984). See \nSchumann at 8-9.  \n \nThe No Electronic Theft Act, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 506, enacted in 1997, imposed criminal \npenalties for copyright infringement, if the infringement was \u201cfor purposes of commercial \nadvantage or private financial gain\u201d by the reproduction of one or more copies of \ncopyrighted works during a 180 period with a total retail value of more than $1,000, or \nby distribution by making it available on a computer network accessible to the public, \n\n \n7 \n \n \nknowing that it was intended for commercial distribution. Applicant admitted copying for \n\u201cprivate financial gain,\u201d i.e., avoiding payment for the downloaded materials, but the total \nvalue of the materials fell short of the $1,000 threshold, and they were not made \navailable on a computer network. Thus, his conduct did not violate the No Electronic \nTheft Act.   \n \nThe record is sparse with respect to the circumstances surrounding much of \nApplicant\u2019s copying of materials from the internet, but he arguably was within the \nboundaries of \u201cfair use\u201d on some of his downloading and copying, except for those \ninstances when he bypassed the licensing requirements. The Digital Millennium \nCopyright Act (DMCA), 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201, which became effective on November 29, \n1999, provides, \u201cNo person shall circumvent a technological measure that effectively \ncontrols access to a work protected under this title.\u201d Applicant admitted that he \ncircumvented the measures that required payment for many of the materials he \ndownloaded. Thus, each time he circumvented the payment requirement between \nNovember 29, 1999 and October 20, 2007, his last admitted download, he violated the \nDMCA. \n \nDepartment Counsel also argued that Applicant committed larceny under the law \nof the state in which he now resides. The statute cited, however, refers to \u201cgoods or \nmerchandise of any store or other mercantile establishment.\u201d It also applies to only one \nof several states in which Applicant resided while downloading materials without paying \nfor them. The state\u2019s computer crimes statute, not cited by Department Counsel, is \ndevoted primarily to crimes in which a computer is used as a tool for committing other \ncriminal offenses. In light of my conclusion that Applicant violated the DMCA, I find it \nunnecessary to determine whether he violated state law. Based on his violations of the \nDMCA, I conclude AG \u00b6 40(f) is raised. \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \ncondition in AG \u00b6 40(f), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to \nthe government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \n \nAmong the enumerated mitigating conditions under this guideline, the only \nrelevant mitigating condition is set out in AG \u00b6 41(a): \u201c[S]o much time has elapsed since \nthe behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment.\u201d This mitigating condition requires an assessment of the likelihood of \nrecurrence based on either the passage of time or the unusual circumstances \nsurrounding the behavior. Even if recurrence is unlikely, this mitigating condition is not \nestablished unless the conduct does not cast doubt on the Applicant\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n \nThe first prong of AG \u00b6 41(a) (\u201cso much time\u201d) is not established, because \nApplicant\u2019s last act of downloading material without paying for it was only a year before \n\n \n8 \n \n \nhis hearing, ending a span of about 15 years of downloading copyrighted material one \nor more times a month. The second prong (\u201cunusual circumstances\u201d) is not established \nby the evidence. Regarding the likelihood of recurrence, Applicant told a security \ninvestigator in October 2007 that he intended to do less unauthorized downloading and \n\u201csomeday\u201d would stop completely. At the hearing he declared he would not do it again. \nBased on his demeanor and all the evidence, I believe Applicant\u2019s declaration of intent \nat the hearing was honest and sincere, but it was motivated by his belated realization \nthat continuing his unauthorized downloading could cost him his clearance. I am not \nconvinced that he will not revert to old behavior when the pressure of obtaining a \nclearance is removed. \n \n \nThere is no evidence Applicant used a contractor-owned or government \ncomputer for his activities. All the downloading appears to have been off duty. The \nmarket value of the materials he downloaded is less than $1,000, spread over a 15-year \nperiod. The security significance of his conduct arises from its repetitive nature over a \nlong period, and his awareness that each act was illegal. His conduct demonstrates an \ninability or unwillingness to follow rules; and it casts doubt about his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. I conclude AG \u00b6 41(a) is not established. \n \n \nThe SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges Applicant intends to continue his illegal downloading. This \nallegation does not plead an independent basis for concern, but merely alleges intent to \ncontinue the disqualifying conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. As such, it pleads the absence \nof mitigation instead of an independent basis for concern. It also is rebutted by the \nevidence because, as noted above, Applicant honestly and sincerely intended as of the \ndate of the hearing to discontinue his illegal downloading. Whether he will change his \nmind when he is relieved of the pressure of obtaining a clearance is a separate issue. I \nresolve SOR \u00b6 1.b in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe SOR cross-alleges the Guideline M conduct under this guideline (SOR \u00b6 \n2.a). In addition, it alleges that in 1999 he stole four memory sticks, a central processing \nunit chip, and a video card (SOR \u00b6 2.b). The concern under this guideline is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15 as follows: \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \ninformation.\u201d \nTwo potentially disqualifying conditions are relevant. The disqualifying condition \nin AG \u00b6 16(c) is raised by \u201ccredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue \nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating \nthat the person may not properly safeguard protected information.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(e) is raised \nby \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, that creates a \n\n \n9 \n \n \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as . . . engaging in activities \nwhich, if known, may affect the person's personal, professional, or community standing.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s 15-year record of intentionally circumventing the requirement to pay for \ndownloaded materials, his 9-year record of violating the DMCA, and his theft of \ncomputer equipment in 1999 demonstrate an unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, and are sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 16(c). His theft of computer equipment and \nhis concealment of that conduct from his current employer raise AG \u00b6 16(e). \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe offense is so \nminor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). Each \ncopyright violation, and arguably even the theft of computer equipment, might be \nconsidered \u201cminor\u201d standing alone, but the repetitive nature of Applicant\u2019s conduct over \na 15-year period negates a finding that it was infrequent. His conduct was recent and \nnot the product of unusual circumstances. His repeated illegal conduct, knowing that it \nwas illegal, casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. For these \nreasons as well as the reasons set out above pertaining to AG \u00b6 41(a) under Guideline \nM, I conclude AG 17(c) is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual has taken positive \nsteps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n17(e). Applicant has disclosed his unauthorized downloading to his supervisors, but he \ndid not disclose his theft of computer equipment in 1999. I conclude this mitigating \ncondition is established only for his unauthorized downloading. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines M and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors \n\n \n10 \n \n \nin AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \n \nApplicant began his unauthorized downloading while in college, at a time when \nthe law was unclear and file sharing was widespread and socially acceptable. He knew, \nor should have known, that his unauthorized downloading was an issue after he was \ninterviewed about it by a security investigator in 2002. He continued it after receiving an \ninterim clearance and did not stop until he was interviewed by a security investigator in \nOctober 2007. Even during that interview, he was noncommittal about changing his \nbehavior. His comment to the investigator about hoping to stop illegal downloading \ncompletely suggests something akin to addiction.  \n \n \nApplicant is now 35 years old, married, a homeowner, a father of three children, \ngainfully employed, and highly respected by his peers, colleagues and supervisors. He \nis not an expert in copyright law. He held an interim clearance for almost six years, \napparently without incident. There is no evidence he misused information systems \nowned by the government or his employer. There is no evidence of damage to \ninformation systems or harm to others, except for depriving some copyright owners of \ntheir royalties. \n \n \nOn the other hand, Applicant admitted knowing his conduct was wrong. He \npersisted in his conduct even though he knew after a security interview in 2002 that it \nraised security issues. He continued his illegal downloading while holding an interim \nclearance. His area of expertise is in access control systems. His lengthy history of \nknowingly and intentionally breaking the rules by misusing his expertise to bypass \ntechnological protection for copyrighted materials raises doubt about his ability and \nwillingness to follow rules.  \n \n \nApplicant knowingly and intentionally violated the law every time he illegally \nbypassed a licensing agreement or otherwise failed to pay for software. He made a \nconscious choice not to obey the law, knowing that it was unlikely he would be found \nout, sued, prosecuted, or otherwise held accountable. His theft of computer parts from \nhis employer suggests his vulnerability to peer pressure and willingness to act in self \ninterest when detection is unlikely. He may have matured past his earlier susceptibility \nto peer pressure, but he continued his illegal downloading until recently, when he finally \nrealized he would be held accountable for it. The high degree of trust and confidence \nimplicit in a security clearance requires that an applicant be willing to follow the rules \neven when unsupervised and unlikely to be caught or sanctioned for violations.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines M and \nE, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns based on use of information systems \nand personal conduct. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline M (Information Technology): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant was terminated from\nemployment in December 2003, after she inadvertently submitted a timecard which reported about\nthree more hours than she actually worked. Applicant\u2019s unintentional mistake does not raise security\nconcerns. Clearance is granted.\n\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as\n1\namended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).\nTr. at 17, 43-44; GE 1.\n2\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. On December 22, 2004, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons1\n(SOR) detailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal\nConduct) of the Directive. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on February 28, 2005, and elected\nto have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on May 16, 2007. A\nNotice of Hearing was issued on May 21, 2007, scheduling the hearing for June 19, 2007.\nApplicant\u2019s counsel requested a delay in the case. That request was granted. An Amended Notice\nof Hearing was issued on May 30, 2007, scheduling the hearing for June 26, 2007.  The hearing was\nconducted as scheduled to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on July\n6, 2007.\nRULINGS ON EVIDENCE AND PROCEDURE \nA Motion to Amend the Statement of Reasons was granted to change Applicant\u2019s last name\nin the caption of the SOR to her married name, which is Applicant\u2019s current name. The previous\nname remains in the caption in brackets. \nThe Government offered four exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1\nthrough 4, and admitted without objections. Applicant testified and offered one exhibit that was\nmarked Applicant Exhibit (AE) A, and admitted without objection. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She is married, with no children.\nApplicant holds a bachelor\u2019s degree. She has held a security clearance since 1999.  \n2\nApplicant worked for a company from January 2000 to December 2003. When Applicant and\nother employees would enter and exit the work facility of this company, the company required them\nto utilize an iris scanner to gain access. The iris scanner also monitored and kept an electronic record\nof when employees entered and left the facility. A timekeeper had access to that data. Employees\nwould often ask the timekeeper what hours they worked when submitting their timecards, for pay\n\nTr. at 25-30.\n3\nGE 2.\n4\nTr. at 31-34, 36-37, 42-43.\n5\nGE 3.\n6\nTr. at 35.\n7\n3\npurposes. The employees were paid every two weeks, and submitted their timecards at the end of the\ntwo-week pay period.3\nApplicant married her third husband on the morning of December 1, 2003, a Monday, in a\ncivil ceremony at the County Courthouse. The marriage certificate states the marriage occurred at\n8:56.  Applicant took several hours off work in the morning for the ceremony, then went to work\n4\nlate. December 1, 2003 was the first day of a new two-week pay period. Applicant\u2019s timecard for that\npay period would have been due after the last day of the pay period, which was Friday, December\n12, 2003. When Applicant submitted her timecard, she asked the timekeeper for her hours. The hours\nhe told her did not reflect that Applicant was off the morning of December 1, 2003. Applicant did\nnot remember to correctly annotate that she only worked about five hours on December 1, 2003, and\nsubmitted a timecard that stated she worked eight hours on that date.  I find this was an inadvertent\n5\nmistake on Applicant\u2019s part, and not an intentional falsification of her timecard.\nOn December 16, 2003, Applicant\u2019s employment was terminated. A letter from the company\nstated:\nThis letter is to inform you that [employer] has elected to exercise the \u201cat will\u201d option\nto terminate the employment relationship, effective 16 December 2003. The basis for\nthis decision is for Violation of Company Policy . . .  We wish you good luck in your\nfuture endeavors.  \n6\nThere were no employer records submitted as evidence, and no witnesses called to testify as to the\nnature of the violation of company policy. Applicant\u2019s company provided her a copy of the\ntermination letter when she was terminated, but would not provide specific details as to the nature\nof the violation. Applicant testified she was eventually told by corporate officials that the termination\noccurred because she submitted the timecard which reported hours that she did not work.  \n7\nApplicant was interviewed for her background investigation on April 30, 2004. Applicant\nwas asked about three complaints on file from her former employer. She admitted she did not work\na full day on December 1, 2003, but denied she intentionally falsified her timecard. Applicant denied\nknowledge of the other complaints. The investigator did not inform Applicant of the exact nature of\nthe complaints. The statement contains no specifics, but it appears there may have been allegations\nof a sexual comment and harassment of a co-worker. Applicant wrote she was never informed of any\ncomplaints, and that she could not defend herself against the allegations since she did not know what\nthe allegations were. Applicant did admit there were several employees she did not get along with,\n\nGE 4.\n8\nTr. at 49.\n9\nAE A.\n10\nDepartment of the Navy v.

No additional evidence was submitted about the alleged incidents\n8\nduring Applicant\u2019s employment with this company. As noted above, I find Applicant unintentionally\nsubmitted a timecard which reflected more hours than she actually worked. There is no reliable\nevidence to support a finding that Applicant violated any other company policies.\nA former supervisor of Applicant testified she was a trustworthy person who followed\ncompany rules and policy.  Another former supervisor wrote that Applicant\u2019s work ethic was superb;\n9\nshe was diligent, dependable, reliable, honest, trustworthy, and always willing to abide by company\nand client rules.10\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n11\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n12\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n13\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n14\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n15\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n16\nThe Directive sets forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions\n(MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision must be a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the\n\nTr. at 69-70.\n17\n5\nwhole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 and \u00b6 E2.2.1., of\nthe Directive.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guidelines are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct\nConduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations  could indicate that the person may\nnot properly safeguard classified information. \nThere are four Personal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (PC DC) potentially applicable\nto this case. They are PC DC E2.A5.1.2.1 (Reliable, unfavorable information provided by associates,\nemployers, coworkers, neighbors, and other acquaintances), PC DC E2.A5.1.2.2 (The deliberate\nomission, concealment or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities), PC DC E2.A5.1.2.4 (Personal conduct or\nconcealment of information that increases an individual\u2019s vulnerability to coercion, exploitation,\nor duress, such as engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal,\nprofessional, or community standing or render the person susceptible to blackmail), and PC DC\nE2.A5.1.2.5 (A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, including violation of any written or\nrecorded agreement made between the individual and the agency). \nApplicant submitted a timecard that reflected more hours than she actually worked.  This was\nan unintentional, inadvertent act. Department Counsel stated that the Government\u2019s concern in this\ncase was that Applicant intentionally falsified her timecard for monetary gain, and that an\nunintentional or inadvertent act did not raise any concerns.  No disqualifying condition applies in\n17\nthis case.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process\n\n6\nfactors listed in the Directive. I have also considered every finding of fact and conclusion discussed\nabove. \nApplicant was terminated from her employment in December 2003, for submitting an\nincorrect timecard. This was an inadvertent act, with no intent to defraud her company. There were\nvague accusations of other complaints raised in Applicant\u2019s statement to her background\ninvestigator. Applicant admitted she did not get along with several co-workers, but denied\nknowledge of any other complaints. The Government did not submit independent evidence of co-\nworker complaints or allegations. Two of Applicant\u2019s former supervisors attested to her\ntrustworthiness, dependability, reliability, honesty, and to her compliance with company and clients\u2019\nrules and policy. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence\nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns based\non her personal conduct.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.
