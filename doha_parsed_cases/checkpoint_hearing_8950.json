After reviewing the results of Applicant\u2019s background investigation,\nadjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to\nmake a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with the national\n1\ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s access to classified information. On February 3, 2009,\nDOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise\nMay 29, 2009\n\n The revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on December 29, 2005,which were\n2\nimplemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending official revision of the Directive,\nthese guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.\n See Directive, Enclosure 3, Section E3.1.7. The FORM included eight documents (Items 1 - 8) proffered in\n3\nsupport of the government\u2019s case.\n2\nsecurity concerns addressed in the revised Adjudicative Guidelines  under Guideline G\n2\n(alcohol consumption).\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a decision without a\nhearing. On March 26, 2009, Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material\n(FORM)  in support of the government\u2019s preliminary decision. Applicant received the\n3\nFORM on April 8, 2009. According to Section VI, at page 5 of the FORM, Applicant was\nadvised he had 30 days to file a response to the FORM. On May 5, 2009, Applicant\nsubmitted a response consisting of a one page letter, which DOHA received on May 11,\n2009. The case was assigned to me on May 18, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nThe government alleged through the SOR that between 1973 and at least\nOctober 2008, the Applicant drank alcohol, \u201cat times to excess and to the point of\nintoxication, at times daily\u201d (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that in 1993, he was arrested, charged , and\nconvicted of driving while intoxicated (SOR \u00b6 1.b); that on February 7, 2006, Applicant\nreported to his workplace under the influence of alcohol and was suspended without\npay for 30 days (SOR \u00b6 1.c); that on February 7, 2006, Applicant was also charged with\npublic intoxication, which was later dismissed, for the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c\n(SOR \u00b6 1.d); that between February 14, 2006, and February 26, 2006, Applicant was\ndiagnosed with and treated for alcohol dependence (SOR \u00b6 1.e); that between March 1,\n2006 and April 12, 2006, he was again diagnosed with and treated for alcohol\ndependence (SOR \u00b6 1.f); and that, as of October 2008, despite his prior diagnoses of\nand treatments for alcohol dependence, Applicant continued to consume alcohol (SOR\n\u00b6 1.g).\nApplicant admitted without explanation all of the SOR allegations. In addition to\nthe facts entered in the record through Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following\nfindings of relevant fact.\nApplicant is 52 years old and works as a quality engineer for a defense\ncontractor. He has worked for the same company since August 1982 and has held a\nsecurity clearance since June 1985. He and his wife have been married since July 1976\nand have raised two children, both now in their 20's. (Gx. 1) \nIn January of either 1991 or 1992, Applicant was arrested and charged with\ndriving while intoxicated (DWI). He had been drinking at home, but decided to drive to\nget something to eat. On the way, he fell asleep at the wheel and drove off the road.\nWhen the police responded, he was administered a breathalyser test, which registered\nhis blood alcohol content (BAC) at .242%. He subsequently pleaded guilty, was\n\n3\nassessed a fine and court costs, was placed on probation for six months, and his\ndriver\u2019s license was suspended for six months. (FORM, Items 3 - 5)\nAfter work on February 6, 2006, Applicant drank between 10 and 12 beers until\nabout midnight. When he reported for work the next day at 5:30 in the morning, he still\nhad the smell of alcohol on his breath. At about 8:30 that morning, he was told to drive a\ncompany  vehicle to a nearby Army depot. On the way, he bought and drank two beers.\nWhen he arrived at the depot, gate guards smelled alcohol on his breath and detained\nhim. Applicant failed a field sobriety test. Base police issued him a citation for public\nintoxication. After initially denying to his supervisor that he had been drinking, Applicant\nadmitted his misconduct and was suspended without pay for 30 days. (FORM, Items 4,\n5 and 8)\nFrom February 14 until February 26, 2006, Applicant received in-patient alcohol\ndetoxification and treatment. He received a discharge diagnosis of alcohol dependence.\nIt was recommended he participate in a 12-step recovery program and that he \u201cabstain\nfrom all mood and mind altering chemicals.\u201d (FORM, Item 7) On March 7, 2006,\nApplicant began an outpatient alcohol assessment and treatment program. When he\nwas discharged on April 12, 2006, he was again diagnosed as being alcohol dependent\nwith recommendations that he seek recovery assistance through a 12-step program and\nthat he abstain from alcohol. The diagnoses in both February and in April 2006 were\nmade by either qualified medical professionals or by licensed clinical social workers on\nthe staff a recognized alcohol treatment program. When he appeared to answer the\npublic intoxication charge, he advised the court that he was still participating in alcohol\ncounseling; whereupon, the charge was dismissed. (FORM, Items 5 and 7)\nApplicant began drinking alcohol, predominantly beer, when he was 16 years old.\nHis drinking progressed to the point of daily intoxication after consuming between 6 and\n12 beers in a single setting. At one point during alcohol treatment, Applicant stated that\nhe could not control his drinking. After he was arrested and convicted of DWI in the\nearly 1990s, he continued to drive after drinking until he reported to work under the\ninfluence of alcohol in February 2006. (FORM, Items 5, 7 and 8)\nApplicant avers he now can control his drinking, and that he limits his alcohol\nconsumption to three beers in a sitting. He claims he no longer drinks and drives, and\nthat he may go several days without drinking anything at all. Records from his March\n2006 treatment show that he was participating in Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, but\nthere is no information as whether he has continued his involvement in AA. (Response\nto FORM; FORM, Item 7)\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the revised\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n4\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n4\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n4\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factor are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nAG \u00b6 21 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption).\nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n5\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a\n6\nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the\ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the\nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national\ninterests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard\ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.7\n\n5\nAnalysis\nAlcohol Consumption. \nAvailable information in this record is sufficient to support the SOR allegations\nabout Applicant\u2019s use of alcohol. There are no controverted issues of fact as Applicant\nadmitted all of the SOR allegations. Further, the FORM and its attachments contain\nsufficient independent information to support these allegations. The facts established\nraise reasonable doubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability to hold a security clearance.\nSpecifically, as stated in AG \u00b6 21, \u201cexcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the\nexercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol consumption for the past 35 years has, at times, been\nabusive. He admits consuming as many as 12 beers in a single sitting. When he was\narrested for DWI in the early 1990s, his BAC was more than twice the legal limit in most\nstates. He continued to drink and drive until 2006, when he was suspended without pay\nfor 30 days after he reported to work still intoxicated from the night before, when he had\nconsumed up to 12 beers. At 8:30 a.m. the day of his suspension, he drank two beers\nwhile driving a company car during working hours. In addition to his employer\u2019s\ndisciplinary actions, base police charged him with public intoxication after he failed a\nfield sobriety test. Subsequent alcohol treatment in 2006 resulted in two separate\ndiagnoses of alcohol dependence. Both programs recommended that he abstain from\nalcohol and continue a structured 12-step recovery program. However, he still drinks,\nalbeit at reduced  amounts and frequency, and he does not appear to be involved in AA\nor other recovery programs. \nThe foregoing requires application of the disqualifying conditions at AG \u00b6 22(a)\n(alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under  the influence,\nfighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern,\nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent), AG \u00b6 22(b) (alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or\nduty in an intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of\nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent), AG \u00b6\n22(c) (habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment,\nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent), AG \u00b6 22(d) (diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g.,\nphysician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol\ndependence), AG \u00b6 22(e) (evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a\nlicensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment\nprogram), and AG \u00b6 22(f) (relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and\ncompletion of an alcohol rehabilitation program). By contrast, Applicant has not provided\nany information that shows he is following the recommendations of the treatment\nprograms he completed and is pursuing rehabilitation and a sober lifestyle, nothing in\nthis record supports application of any of the mitigating conditions listed under AG \u00b6 23.\nOn balance, Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns about his drinking.\n\n See footnote 4, supra.\n8\n See footnote 7, supra. \n9\n6\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guidelines G. I have also reviewed the record before me in\nthe context of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 52 years old and\npresumed to be a mature adult. According to his SF 86, he has been steadily employed\nwith the same company since 1982 and has held a security clearance since 1985. Apart\nfrom that, there is no information that might support application of any of the whole\nperson factors. As long as Applicant continues to ignore the recommendations\nattendant to his diagnoses of alcohol dependence, he is at risk of future adverse\nalcohol-related conduct. A fair and commonsense assessment  of all available\n8\ninformation bearing on Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption shows he has failed to address\nsatisfactorily the government\u2019s doubts about his ability or willingness to protect the\ngovernment\u2019s interests as his own. Because protection of the national interest is\nparamount in these determinations, such doubts must be resolved in favor of the\ngovernment.  \n9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a - 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information\nis denied.\n                            \n                                                    \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to sensitive information is granted. \n \nOn May 5, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the trustworthiness concerns under \nGuidelines H and E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) \nRegulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987, as amended \n(Regulation), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing May 13, 2009, and did not request a \nhearing before an administrative judge. On June 17, 2009, Department Counsel \nrequested a hearing. I was assigned the case on July 27, 2009. DOHA issued the \n1 \n \nNovember 18, 2009\n\n2 \n \n                                                          \nNotice of Appearance on August 6, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled on \nSeptember 24, 2009. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were \nadmitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. He offered Exhibits \n(AE) A and B, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of \nthe hearing (Tr.) on September 14, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations in the \nSOR. His admissions are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 27 years old, single and has no children. He graduated from college \nin 2004. He has worked as a systems analyst for a federal contractor since 2005. He \ncompleted a public trust application (PTA) and signed it on January 17, 2008. In \nresponse to a question asking if he used illegal drugs in the past year, he answered \n\u201cno.\u201d In response to a question asking if he had been involved in the purchase, transfer, \ntrafficking, or shipping of illegal drugs in the past, he answered \u201cno.\u201d1  \n \nIn May 2008, while on a camping trip with friends from high school and college, \nApplicant used marijuana one time. He did not buy the marijuana. He and his friends \nwere in a secluded area in the woods. On the same night, he also used hallucinogenic \nmushrooms. He did not hallucinate. The marijuana and mushrooms belonged to one of \nthe many friends who were on the trip. Applicant has not used marijuana, mushrooms, \nor any other illegal drug since May 2008. Applicant does not live with or work with any of \nthe people with whom he went camping.2  \n \nApplicant acknowledges he made a \u201cstupid\u201d mistake when he used the drugs. He \nregrets his actions. He socializes with people from work. Some of them are aware of his \ndrug use. Applicant does not believe any of the friends that he socializes with use illegal \ndrugs. He did not intend on using drugs when he went on the camping trip. The \ncamping trip is an annual occurrence and he credibly testified that he did not use illegal \ndrugs during the other years he attended, to include 2007 and 2009. He admitted he did \nnot think about the fact that he had completed a PTA and was waiting for the \ndetermination when he used the drugs. He forgot he had completed the application and \ndid not think of the impact his one-time use would have on it.3  \n \nWhile attending college, primarily as a freshman, Applicant used marijuana less \nthan ten times. After graduating from college in 2004, he may have used it one other \ntime. He never purchased marijuana. He did not use any other illegal drugs during this \n \n1 Tr. 14-20; GE 1, 2. \n \n2 Tr. 18-20. \n \n3 Tr. 29-32, 39-47. \n\n3 \n \n                                                          \ntime. He does not intend to use any illegal drugs in the future. He admitted he was \nwrong to use the drugs and is sorry for his actions.4  \n \nApplicant provided character letters from his manager and a coworker. He is \ndescribed in the letters as a dedicated worker with integrity. He is respected for his \nachievements. He is recognized for his leadership and resourcefulness. He has a \npositive attitude and is able to handle demanding challenges. He has also demonstrated \nexceptional knowledge, discipline and dedication to his employer.5 Applicant provided a \ncopy of his performance appraisal which reflects he is an excellent employee.6 \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for \n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n \n4 Tr. 20 29, 41.  \n \n5 AE A. \n \n6 AE B. \n\n4 \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement:  \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Drugs are \ndefined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include: (1) \nDrugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in \nthe Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or \ncannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) \ninhalants and other similar substances; Drug abuse is the illegal use of a \ndrug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved \nmedical direction. \n \nI have considered all of the drug involvement disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 \n25 and have especially considered the following: \n \n(a) any drug abuse; and \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of drug paraphernalia. \n \n\n5 \n \nApplicant used marijuana and hallucinogenic mushrooms one time in May 2008, \nafter he completed his PTA, but before a determination was made. To use the illegal \nsubstances, he must have possessed them. I find both of the above disqualifying \nconditions apply. \n \n \nI have considered all of the drug involvement mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 \nand especially considered the following: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse drugs in the future, such as (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate \nperiod of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic \nrevocation of clearance for any violation.  \n \nApplicant used marijuana and mushrooms one time in May 2008, while on a \ncamping trip with high school and college friends. He minimally experimented with \nmarijuana when he was a freshman in college and may have used it one other time. He \nhas not used any illegal drugs since May 2008. He understands he made a mistake. He \ndoes not intend to use any illegal drugs in the future. The camping trip is an annual \nevent and he did not use drugs during the trip the year before or the year after 2008. He \nattributes his use to youthful indiscretion and a one-time occurrence. I find his behavior \nwas infrequent. Applicant has matured to the point that he understands that his youthful \nindiscretions have consequences. Applicant has not used illegal drugs since May 2008, \neven after being placed in the same environment. He acknowledged his poor judgment \nand does not intend to use illegal drugs in the future. I find his conduct is unlikely to \nrecur. He has grown up and moved past this type of conduct. I find mitigating conditions \n(a) and (b) apply.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. \nI have considered all of the personal conduct disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 \n16 and especially considering the following: \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \n\n6 \n \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s \npersonal , professional, or community standing. \nApplicant completed a PTA in January 2008. Pending the adjudication of his \nPTA, he used illegal drugs in May 2008. I find the above disqualifying condition applies.  \nI have considered the all of the personal conduct mitigating conditions under AG \n\u00b6 17 and especially considered:  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \nApplicant reported his drug use during his interview. He was honest and \nforthcoming. He acknowledged he made a stupid mistake and regrets his conduct. He \nhas matured and does not intend to use any illegal drugs in the future. Some of his \ncoworkers are aware of his prior drug use. I find based on these facts and the same \nrationale discussed under the drug involvement guideline, that all of the above \nmitigating conditions apply.  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They are:  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n7 \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public \ntrust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a young man with no \nsignificant drug history, who went on a camping trip with high school and college \nfriends, and used marijuana and hallucinogenic mushrooms one time. He has not used \nany illegal drugs since then and acknowledges he made an irresponsible decision. He \nregrets it and does not intend on repeating it. He is a valued employee. Applicant has \nmatured and it is unlikely he will repeat his mistake. Overall, the record evidence does \nnot leave me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \npublic trust position. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \ntrustworthiness concerns arising under the guidelines for drug involvement and personal \nconduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n______________________________ \nCarol G.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact. Applicant admitted all but one of the nine allegations under personal conduct. His admissions are considered in my findings of fact. Applicant is 43 years old and has worked for his defense contractor employer for more than five years as a systems analyst. He served 14 years on active duty with the Army. He is married but has been separated from his wife since 1996. He presently lives with another woman. He has three children from his marriage and one with his girlfriend. The three children live with their mother, and the one child lives with him and his girlfriend (Tr. 31-33; Gov. Ex. 1, e-QIP, dated April 9, 2007; Gov. Ex. 12, DD Form 214, dated August 2008). The personal conduct offenses date from 1986, when he first entered active duty in the Army. The personal conduct offenses involve offenses arising from domestic disputes (SOR 1.b, 1.e, 1.g); the military offense of absence without leave (SOR 1.c, 1.d), and disrespect to a noncommissioned officer (SOR 1.a); and traffic offenses (SOR 1.f, 1.h, 1.i). Applicant received non-judicial punishment under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) for disrespect to a noncommissioned officer in 1986 (SOR 1.a). Applicant was involved in a verbal confrontation with a noncommissioned officer shortly after arriving at his first duty station. He was on duty and was directed to sweep the barracks area.",

Blank, Jr., Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) for employment with a defense contractor on April 9, 2007. On May 21, 2009, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nto Applicant detailing security concerns for personal conduct under Guideline E. The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. Applicant \nacknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 23, 2009. \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 10, 2009. Applicant admitted \neight of the nine allegations of personal conduct under Guideline E with explanation. He \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge.   \n \n \n1 \n \n \nJanuary 27, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on August 28, 2009, and the case \nwas assigned to me on September 21, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on \nOctober 7, 2009, for a hearing on October 19, 2009. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. The government offered 12 exhibits, marked government exhibit (Gov. Ex.) \n1 through 12, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his behalf. \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on November 6, 2009. Based on a \nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nApplicant received a copy of the Notice of Hearing in the mail at his home. He \ncould not remember the date the Notice of Hearing was received. He received a copy of \nthe Notice of Hearing from his employer on October 18, 2009, the day before the \nhearing. Applicant is entitled to 15 days advance notice of the hearing (Directive \nE3.1.8). Applicant discussed with Department Counsel the hearing date of October 19, \n2009, prior to the Notice of Hearing being mailed so actual notice was given more than \n15 days prior to the hearing. However, Applicant signed for the Notice of Hearing only \none day prior to the hearing. At the hearing, Applicant waived the 15 days notice \nrequirement (Tr. 4-5). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing essential findings of fact. Applicant admitted all but one of the nine allegations \nunder personal conduct. His admissions are considered in my findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 43 years old and has worked for his defense contractor employer for \nmore than five years as a systems analyst. He served 14 years on active duty with the \nArmy. He is married but has been separated from his wife since 1996. He presently \nlives with another woman. He has three children from his marriage and one with his \ngirlfriend. The three children live with their mother, and the one child lives with him and \nhis girlfriend (Tr. 31-33; Gov. Ex. 1, e-QIP, dated April 9, 2007; Gov. Ex. 12, DD Form \n214, dated August 2008). \n \nThe personal conduct offenses date from 1986, when he first entered active duty \nin the Army. The personal conduct offenses involve offenses arising from domestic \ndisputes (SOR 1.b, 1.e, 1.g); the military offense of absence without leave (SOR 1.c, \n1.d), and disrespect to a noncommissioned officer (SOR 1.a); and traffic offenses (SOR \n1.f, 1.h, 1.i). \n \nApplicant received non-judicial punishment under the Uniform Code of Military \nJustice (UCMJ) for disrespect to a noncommissioned officer in 1986 (SOR 1.a). \nApplicant was involved in a verbal confrontation with a noncommissioned officer shortly \nafter arriving at his first duty station. He was on duty and was directed to sweep the \nbarracks area. The charge of quarters directed him to sweep some debris away from a \n\n \n3 \n \n \ndoor. Applicant did not like what the noncommissioned officer said and disrespectfully \nresponded back to him. He was sentenced to forfeit pay, restricted to the company \narea, and directed to perform extra duty (Tr. 23-24; Gov. Ex. 10, DA Form 5248-R, \nReport of Unfavorable Information, dated July 14, 1986). \n \nApplicant received a reprimand from his unit commander for domestic violence in \n1990 (SOR 1.b). The military police were called to Applicant's quarters by Applicant's \nwife because he pushed her during a verbal confrontation. His unit commander took \nadministrative action with a written reprimand (Tr. 20-23; Gov. Ex. 7, DA Form 4833, \nCommander's report of disciplinary or administrative action, dated February 13, 1990). \n \nApplicant received non-judicial punishment in 1997, for failure to report to his \nduty station (SOR 1.c). Applicant, now a sergeant, was the unit supply sergeant. \nApplicant said he was told by the first sergeant not to report to his work site until an \nissue involving him was resolved by the commander. The first sergeant stated he did \nnot tell Applicant not to report to his place of duty. Applicant's commander imposed \npunishment for failure to go to his prescribed place of duty in violation of Article 86, \nUCMJ and imposed as punishment a forfeiture of $382 (Tr. 24-26, 37-40; Gov. Ex. 8, \nDA Form 5248-R, Report of unfavorable information, dated October 28, 1997). \n \nApplicant received non-judicial punishment for absence without authority in 1999 \n(SOR 1.d). Applicant was granted emergency leave when his grandmother died. He \nwent to Puerto Rico for the funeral. Applicant stated he was unable to return to his unit \non time because of a hurricane. He could not call his unit for an extension of his leave \nbecause telephone service was disrupted by the hurricane. Applicant returned to his \nunit two days late. Since he had not requested an extension of his leave, Applicant was \npunished by his commander for absence without leave, and was sentenced to a \nsuspended reduction in grade, a suspended forfeiture of $743 for two months, and extra \nduty (Tr. 26-27, 40-42; Gov. Ex. 9, DA Form 5248-R, Report of Unfavorable Information, \ndated May 20, 1999). \n \nApplicant admitted he was arrested and charged with domestic battery in August \n2001 (SOR 1.e). Applicant and his wife separated, and Applicant was living with his \ngirlfriend and their child. She called the police charging him with domestic violence. The \npolice arrested Applicant based on the word of the girlfriend, and he spent a night in jail. \nHis girlfriend paid his release bond the next day. She changed her story concerning the \nassault, and the charge was not prosecuted by the local prosecutor (Tr. 18-19, 42-45; \nGov. Ex. 3, Letter with court documents, dated August 25, 2008). \n \nApplicant admitted he was cited and fined for driving on a suspended license in \n2002 (SOR 1.f). Applicant did not realize his license had been suspended for failure to \npay child support until he was stopped by the police. After separating from his wife, \nApplicant and his wife kept a joint checking account. Applicant's wife withdrew support \nfunds from the account. She then withdrew all of the funds from the account, so \nApplicant had her name removed from the account. Applicant's wife filed for child \nsupport and she was awarded back support of $24,000 even though she had been \n\n \n4 \n \n \nwithdrawing funds from the account for over two years. Applicant's wife requested child \nsupport. She received court ordered monthly support of $1,000. Applicant was not \npresent at the proceeding and did not know of the order. After his arrest, Applicant \nstarted making child support payments and his license was restored. He is current with \nhis child support payments (Tr. 45-47).  \n \nApplicant admitted he was arrested for trespassing and domestic violence in \n2004 (SOR 1.g). Applicant and his girlfriend, the same person involved in the incident at \nSOR 1.e, separated but he had visitation rights for their son. He called his girlfriend to \ninform her he was coming to her house to pick up the child for his visitation. She \ninformed him it was fine. When he arrived, she would not release their son. His girlfriend \ncalled the police and he was arrested for domestic violence and first degree trespass. \nThe domestic violence charge was dismissed and he was found guilty of trespass. His \nsentence was to stay away from his girlfriend. Applicant now knows if there is an issue \non visitation to have a police officer accompany him to pick up the child for visitations \n(Tr. 18-20, 53-56; Gov. Ex. 6, Warrant, dated June 11, 2004). \n \nApplicant was arrested for driving on a suspended license, fleeing the scene of \nan accident, and traffic violation on a military installation in 2006 (SOR 1.h). Applicant's \nlicense was suspended, but he nonetheless drove his girlfriend's car to work. He was \ninvolved in an accident when another vehicle pulled in front of him causing a collision. \nThe other driver was cited for causing the accident. Applicant fled the scene of the \naccident, and went to a nearby gas station to call his girlfriend and inform her of the \naccident. He later returned to the scene of the accident to learn his car had been towed \nand the military police were looking for him. He turned himself in to the military police. \nHe was cited by military police for driving on a suspended license, fleeing the scene of \nthe accident, and involvement in a traffic accident. Applicant paid a fine and did not \nhave to appear in court (Tr. 18-21, 48-52 Gov. Ex. 4, Military police report, dated June \n15, 2006). \n \nApplicant was apprehended in 2007, for failure to carry a driver's license with him \n(SOR 1.i). He did not have a valid license since there was a block on his license for two \ntraffic citations he received in another state. He paid the fines in the other state, and \nnow has a valid license (Tr. 53-54; Gov. Ex. 5, Citation, dated August 17, 2007).  \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \n\n \n5 \n \n \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \nPersonal Conduct \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules or regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation (AG \u00b6 15). Applicant's multiple arrests and convictions for military offenses, \ndomestic violence, and traffic and driving offenses raise Personal Conduct Disqualifying \nConditions (PC DC) AG \u00b6 16(c) (credible adverse information in several adjudicative \nissue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, support a whole-person assessment \nof questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness \nto comply with rules or regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person \nmay not properly safeguard protected information); PC DC AG 16(d) (credible adverse \ninformation that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be \nsufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which when combined with all \n\n \n6 \n \n \navailable information supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules or \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly \nsafeguard protected information); and PC DC AG 16(e) (personal conduct, or \nconcealment of information about one's conduct, that creates a vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities, which, if known \nmay affect the person's personal, professional, or community standing . . ).  While none \nof the offenses charged are by themselves serious, there are multiple lesser offenses to \nbe considered as a whole. \n \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under personal conduct. \nApplicant raised by his testimony Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (PC MC) AG \n\u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment); PC MC AG \u00b6 17(d) (the individual has acknowledged the behavior and \nobtained counseling to change the behavior or taken positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused the untrustworthy, unreliable, or other \ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur); PC MC AG \u00b6 17(e) (the \nindividual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress); PC MC AG \u00b6 17(f) (the information was unsubstantiated or \nfrom a source of questionable reliability); and PC MC AG \u00b6 17(g) (association with \nperson involved in criminal activity has ceased or occurs under circumstances that do \nnot cast doubt upon the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness \nto comply with rules and regulations).   \n \nThere was a pattern of disciplinary problems amounting to inappropriate personal \nconduct when Applicant was in the Army. He received non-judicial punishment for \ndisrespect to a noncommissioned officer, and absence without leave. The offenses \nhappened 10 to 20 years ago and were strictly military-related offenses. Since Applicant \nis no longer in the military, this conduct is unlikely to recur. The conduct does not now \ncast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment because he is now \nolder and more mature and inclined to follow rules and regulations.  \n \nThere were three offenses of domestic violence with his wife or girlfriend. It does \nnot appear he ever seriously struck either women, and the charges either received \nminor punishment or were not prosecuted. There is information that Applicant may not \nhave committed the domestic assaults. He received only a reprimand from his \ncommander for one incident, one was nolle prosequi, and the other was reduced to a \ntrespass offense with only an order to stay away from the alleged victim. Applicant has \nshown that he understands now how to properly manage his relationships with his \nformer wife and his girlfriend concerning visitation rights with his children. The traffic \noffenses were minor involving driving on a suspended license. Traffic or driving \ninfractions can indicate a person's inability or unwillingness to comply with laws and \nregulations. Applicant did not know that his license was suspended for two of the \nincidents. The other incident he did know of the suspension and so he fled from the \n\n \n7 \n \n \nscene of an accident to call his girlfriend and advise her of the accident. Knowingly \ndriving on a suspended license is an error in judgment. However, there is evidence of \nsuccessful rehabilitation in that Applicant is gainfully employed, has not had a traffic-\nrelated incident in over two years, and he expressed that he understands the need to \ncomply with traffic and driving requirements. The offenses are minor, happened under \nunusual or unique circumstances that are no longer present, and are not likely to recur. \nApplicant has presented sufficient information to mitigate security concerns for personal \nconduct.  \n  \nWhole Person Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered that Applicant's military \noffenses happened over ten years ago and will not recur since he is no longer in the \nmilitary. The domestic violence incidents either did not occur, or happened under unique \ncircumstances that are no longer present. The traffic citations are also minor and there \nis evidence of successful rehabilitation. Applicant's personal conduct, when considered \nas a whole, does not support a whole person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that he may not properly safeguard \nprotected information. Overall, on balance, the record evidence leaves me without \nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising \nfrom his personal conduct.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.i: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Applicant resolved or successfully disputed all the delinquent debts \nalleged in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on November 11, 2007. On \nDecember 31, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) made a \npreliminary decision to deny his application, citing security concerns under Guideline F. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  \n \nApril 27, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on January 12, 2009; answered it on January 26, \n2009; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the \nrequest on January 27, 2009. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on February \n11, 2009; and the case was assigned to me on the following day. DOHA issued a notice \nof hearing on March 3, 2009, scheduling the hearing for March 27, 2009. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5 were admitted in evidence \nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AX) A through J, which were admitted without objection. The record closed \nupon adjournment of the hearing on March 27, 2009. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) \non April 2, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.c. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of \nfact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 60-year-old specialist in artificial intelligence employed by a federal \ncontractor. He has worked for his current employer since August 2004. He was born \nand educated in a foreign country, and he became a U.S. citizen in September 2005. \nHe holds doctoral degrees in biochemistry and mathematics (Tr. 5). He has never held \na security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant was married in December 1974. He, his wife, and their son came to the \nU.S. in 1995, and they all became U.S. citizens in September 2005 (Tr. 25-26). His son \nattended college in the U.S. and he obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree and a master\u2019s \ndegree in business administration (Tr. 26).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father had two successive strokes in 1999 while visiting Applicant in \nthe U.S., after which he suffered from severe dementia. His mother had heart disease \nand was unable to care for her husband. As a result, Applicant\u2019s parents stayed in the \nU.S. and were cared for by Applicant and his wife (Tr. 26).  \n \n \nIn 2005, Applicant\u2019s mother suffered a heart attack and passed away six days \nlater. Three or four weeks later, his father passed away. Applicant paid his parents\u2019 \nmedical expenses and their funeral expenses, using credit cards (Tr. 27). Part of \nApplicant\u2019s income was in stock options; and when his employer collapsed financially, \nthe stock options were worthless (Tr. 41). As a result of his parents\u2019 unexpected medical \nand funeral expenses and the devaluation of his stock options, Applicant fell behind on \nhis credit card payments. Applicant\u2019s credit bureau reports (CBR) dated October 1, \n2008, and November 22, 2007, reflected the five delinquent debts alleged in the SOR \n(GX 2; GX 4). \n \n \nApplicant made numerous telephone calls in an effort to negotiate payment plans \non the delinquent credit cards, but the creditors would not agree to long-term payment \n\n \n3 \n \n \nplans. The best settlement Applicant could negotiate was to pay off the delinquent debts \nin one or two installments (Tr. 32).  \n \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a is a credit card account that Applicant closed. He \nreceived a settlement officer in January 2009 (AX G), and he paid the agreed amount in \ntwo installments (AX H). \n \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b is a credit card account that Applicant disputed on \nthe ground that he never had an account with that creditor (GX 5 at 22). The dispute \nwas resolved in his favor and the information deleted from his credit history (AX A).  \n \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c is a credit card account that was referred for \ncollection. Applicant received a settlement offer in January 2009 (AX B), and he paid the \nagreed amount in two installments (AX C; AX I). \n \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d is a debt for telephone services. Applicant \ndisputed this debt, and it no longer appears on his CBR (AX J). \n \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e arose from an early termination of a lease. \nApplicant settled the debt in January 2009, and it has been deleted from his credit \nhistory (AX D; AX E; AX F).  \n \n \nApplicant is now finally stable. After paying all monthly expenses, he has a net \nmonthly remainder of about $4,000 (Tr. 38). He has accumulated between $10,000 and \n$12,000 for emergencies (Tr. 39).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nTwo disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant. AG \u00b6 19(a) is \nraised where there is an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.@ AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised \nwhen there is Aa history of not meeting financial obligations.@ Applicant\u2019s financial history \nraises AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c), shifting the burden to him to extenuate, or mitigate the facts. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and \nthe burden of disproving it never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 20(a). This is a compound \nmitigating condition, with three disjunctive prongs and one conjunctive prong. If any of \nthe three disjunctive prongs are established, the mitigating condition is not fully \nestablished unless the conduct Adoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  The first two prongs (\u201cso long ago\u201d and \n\u201cso infrequent\u201d) are not established, because Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts were recent \nand numerous. The third prong is established, however, because his parents\u2019 illnesses \nand untimely deaths, and the financial collapse of his previous employer are unusual \ncircumstances that are unlikely to recur. The final prong (\u201cdoes not cast doubt\u201d) also is \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s methodical, persistent, and ultimately successful efforts to \novercome his financial problems. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(a) is established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@ AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the \npersons=s control and responsible conduct, must be established. The illness and \nuntimely deaths of Applicant\u2019s parents and the financial collapse of his previous \nemployer were conditions beyond his control, and his response was reasonable and \nresponsible. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(b) is established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(c). The concept of good faith Arequires a showing that a person acts in \na way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or \nobligation.@ ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). \n\u201c[A]n applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that [he/she] has paid off \neach and every debt listed in the SOR. . . All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that [he/she] has . . . established a plan to resolve [his/her] financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d ADP Case No. 06-18900 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2008).  \n \nApplicant produced evidence he had resolved three debts and successfully \ndisputed the remaining two debts. He did not present documentary evidence showing \n\n \n6 \n \n \nthe basis for disputing the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d, but his testimony is corroborated by his \nupdated credit report showing the entry had been deleted. Since less than seven years \nhad elapsed from the time the debt was placed for collection, the most likely reason for \nits deletion was favorable resolution of Applicant\u2019s dispute. See Fair Credit Reporting \nAct, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c(a)(4) (credit report may not contain information on accounts \nplaced for collection that antedate the report by more than seven years).  \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing Athe \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.@ AG \u00b6 20(e). This \ncondition is established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature, well-educated adult. He presented himself at the hearing \nas articulate, very intelligent, sincere, and very methodical. His testimony was plausible \nand credible.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a\ntrustworthiness designation.  On May 8, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising\nApplicant of the basis for that decision\u2013trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\n\n2\nConsiderations) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).\nApplicant requested a hearing.  On January 26, 2010, after the hearing, Administrative Judge LeRoy\nF. Foreman denied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation.  Applicant appealed\npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse trustworthiness\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Specifically, Applicant contends that the Judge\ndid not fully consider the documentation and information she provided.  Applicant also points out\nthat there are differences between a past credit report and a more recent one and that debts occur\nmore than once on each credit report.  Finding no error, we affirm the Judge\u2019s trustworthiness\ndecision.\nThe Judge made the following relevant findings of fact: Applicant is unmarried and has four\nchildren ages 11 through 18, all of whom live with her. Applicant receives no child support.\nApplicant occasionally contributes toward the expenses of her oldest son\u2019s child.  Applicant admitted\nowing a significant number of the debts listed in the SOR.  The debts Applicant has admitted total\nabout $13,000.  Among the debts Applicant denied are seven judgments which she had satisfied.\nA few other SOR debts are duplicates.  After receiving the SOR, Applicant sent a $5 payment to five\nof her creditors.  Three of the creditors accepted the payment, and two did not.  Applicant\u2019s monthly\ntake-home pay (including food stamps) is at least $466 less than her expenses.         \nApplicant contends that the Judge did not fully consider the documentation and information\nshe provided.  A Judge is presumed to have considered all the evidence in the record unless he\nspecifically states otherwise.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-00196 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009);\nISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (App. Bd. May 23, 2008).  In this case, the Judge specifically\ndiscussed Applicant\u2019s evidence, including documentation she submitted after the hearing, but before\nthe close of the record.  Applicant has not overcome the presumption.\nApplicant points out that there are differences between a past credit report and a more recent\none and that some debts appear more than once on each credit report.  Applicant had the opportunity\nat the hearing to point out specific information in the credit reports which she wished the Judge to\nnote, and she did call attention to her efforts to improve her financial situation.  The Judge\nmentioned Applicant\u2019s efforts to improve her financial situation, and he concluded that some of the\ndebts alleged in the SOR were duplicates.\nIn effect, Applicant is arguing that the Judge did not give adequate weight to her evidence\nof mitigation.  The presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make\na favorable trustworthiness determination.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence\nas a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice\nversa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue\nfor a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed\nthe evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 07-01610 at 2 (Mar. 7, 2008).  Here, the Judge discussed Applicant\u2019s mitigating\n\n3\nevidence, although he concluded her efforts to improve her financial situation were not sufficient to\nmitigate the government\u2019s trustworthiness concerns.  Applicant has not demonstrated error.\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Eligibility for assignment to a public trust position is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted her Questionnaire for Public Trust Position (SF 85P), on \nApril 24, 2008, seeking eligibility for assignment to a sensitive position. It was \nresubmitted on May 5, 2008, and again on May 15, 2008. On May 8, 2009, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nthe basis for its preliminary decision to deny her application, citing trustworthiness \nconcerns under Guideline F. The action was taken under Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation \n5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as amended (Regulation); and \nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005.  \n \nJanuary 26, 2010\n\n2 \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 13, 2009, and answered it \non September 10, 2009. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on September 28, \n2009, and the case was assigned to an administrative judge on October 2, 2009. It was \nreassigned to me on October 16, 2009, to consolidate the docket. DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on October 27, 2009, scheduling the hearing for November 16, 2009. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled. The government offered Government Exhibits (GX) \n1 through 6, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified and submitted \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through E, which were admitted without objection. I kept the \nrecord open until December 1, 2009, to enable Applicant to submit additional \ndocumentary evidence. She timely submitted AX F through N, which were admitted \nwithout objection. Department Counsel\u2019s comments regarding AX F through N are \nattached to the record as Hearing Exhibit I. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on November 24, 2009.  \n \nAmendment of SOR \n \n \nOn my own motion, without objection from either party, I amended the SOR to \nreflect that this case is an automated data processing (ADP) case, and not an industrial \nsecurity clearance review (ISCR) case (Tr. 4).  \n \n \nI granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion to amend the SOR \u00b6 1.t, without \nobjection from Applicant, to conform to the evidence by changing the amount of the debt \nalleged from $228 to $218 (Tr. 21). Department Counsel also moved to amend SOR \u00b6 \n1.bb by changing the amount of the debt alleged from $226 to $246. Applicant objected, \nand I denied the motion (Tr. 22).  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the delinquent debts and \nunsatisfied judgments, totaling about $13,000, alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.l, 1.p-1.v, \n1.x, 1.dd, and 1.ff. Her admissions in her answer and at the hearing are incorporated in \nmy findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old medical appointment specialist employed by a defense \ncontractor. She has worked in her current position since March 2006. Her SF 85P \nreflects continuous employment since at least May 1996. She is a high school graduate. \nShe has never held a security clearance or received a favorable trustworthiness \ndetermination. \n \n \nApplicant has never been married, but she has four children, ages 18, 16, 14, \nand 11, all of whom live with her. Each child has a different father. Although she has \nobtained several court orders for child support, she receives no support from any of the \nfathers (Tr. 49-57). Applicant\u2019s 18-year-old son has a one-year-old son, who lives with \nthe child\u2019s mother. Applicant\u2019s son does not pay child support, but Applicant \noccasionally contributes to the child\u2019s expenses (Tr. 158).  \n \n\n3 \n \n \nApplicant testified she is applying for a home ownership program through her \nemployer. The program would assist her in resolving her delinquent debts. As of the \ndate of the hearing, she was not enrolled in any debt resolution or financial counseling \nprograms (Tr. 42-43). After the hearing, she submitted documentation reflecting her \neligibility for the program (AX N). \n \n \nApplicant testified the judgments alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.e, 1.f were for \nvandalism of her public housing residence after she moved out (Tr. 63). The judgments \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, and 1.c were entered against her in 1994, the judgment in SOR \n\u00b6 1.e was entered in December 2000, and the judgment in SOR \u00b6 1.f was entered in \nMay 2001. All four judgments have been satisfied (GX 6 at 1).  \n \n \nApplicant also satisfied three judgments for furniture purchases alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.g, and 1.m. These judgments were entered in September 1994, January 2005, \nand August 2008. The judgments in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.m were satisfied in December \n2005 and March 2009, before the SOR was issued. The record does not reflect when \nthe judgment in SOR \u00b6 1.b was satisfied. \n \n \nApplicant denied ever having cell phone service with the provider alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.n. She has not contacted the provider or filed a dispute with the credit reporting \nagency (Tr. 116-17).  \n \n \nApplicant denied the medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.z-1.cc. She testified the \ndebts were for medical care for her children and should have been paid by Medicaid. \nShe testified she contacted Medicaid but the problem has not been resolved (Tr. 128-\n32).  \n \n \nIn June 2009, after receiving the SOR, Applicant sent a $5 payment to each of \nthe creditors alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.h, and 1.i. She also sent $5 payments to the \ncreditors alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.q and 1.x, but they were rejected and returned to her. \n \n \nApplicant received settlement offers on the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p and 1.t. \nAs of the date of the hearing, she had not accepted the offers or taken any other action \nto resolve the debts. \n \n \nSeveral debts alleged in the SOR appear to be duplicates. The credit card debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.u duplicates the credit card debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k. The car repossession \ndeficiency alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.y duplicates the judgment in SOR \u00b6 1.j. The delinquent \ntelephone bill in SOR \u00b6 1.w duplicates the telephone bill in SOR \u00b6 1.t. The creditor for \nthe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.ee appears to be a collection agency for the medical debts \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.z-1.cc.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s take-home pay is about $980 every two weeks (Tr. 138). Her pay \nfluctuates depending on the amount of overtime she works, and it can be as high as \n$1,131 for a two-week period (Tr. 137; AX B, C, D). She receives $230 in food stamps \nevery month (Tr. 140). Her total monthly expenses are about $2,466, leaving a shortfall \n\n4 \n \nof at least $466 per month (Tr. 150). She has no savings and no retirement accounts \n(Tr. 151). She does not have a budget (Tr. 155-56).  \n \n \nThe table below summarizes the evidence regarding the delinquent debts alleged \nin the SOR. \n \nSOR Debt \nAmount \nStatus \nEvidence \n1.a \nPublic Housing (judgment) \n$90 \nSatisfied \nGX 6 at 1 \n1.b \nFurniture Store (judgment) \n$455 \nSatisfied \nAX J; Tr. 72-74 \n1.c \nPublic Housing (judgment) \n$123 \nSatisfied \nGX 6 at 1 \n1.d \nBad check (judgment) \n$150 \nPaid $5; same \ncreditor as \u00b6\u00b6 1.h \nand 1.i \nGX 6 at 3 \n1.e \nPublic Housing (judgment) \n$319 \nSatisfied \nGX 6 at 3 \n1.f \nPublic Housing (judgment) \n$640 \nSatisfied \nGX 6 at 3 \n1.g \nFurniture Store (judgment) \n$440 \nSatisfied \nAX K \n1.h \nBad check (judgment) \n$2,774 \nSame as \u00b6 1.d \nGX 6 at 3 \n1.i \nBad check (judgment \n$700 \nSame as \u00b6 1.d \nGX 6 at 3 \n1.j \nCar repossession (judgment)\n$2,978 \nPaid $5 \nGX 6 at 5 \n1.k \nCredit card (judgment) \n$1,876 \nUnsatisfied \nTr. 95-98 \n1.l \nPayday loan (judgment) \n$115 \nPaid $5 \nGX 6 at 4 \n1.m \nFurniture Store (judgment) \n$265 \nSatisfied \nAX L \n1.n \nCell phone \n$577 \nUnresolved \nTr. 116-17 \n1.o \nTelephone service \n$443 \nUnpaid \nTr. 117 \n1.p \nTelephone service \n$231 \nSettlement offer \nAX F \n1.q \nBank loan \n$361 \n$5 payment \nrejected \nGX 6 at 2;  \nAX A at 1 \n1.r \nShoe store \n$98 \nPaid $5 \nGX 6 at 5 \n1.s \nCredit card \n$449 \nPaid $5 \nGX 6 at 3 \n1.t \nTelephone \n$218 \nSettlement offer \nAX G \n1.u \nCredit card \n$1,922 \nSame as \u00b6 1.k \nAX E at 4; Tr. 105 \n1.v \nTelephone \n$180 \nUnresolved \nTr. 118-19 \n1.w \nTelephone \n$250 \nDuplicate of \u00b6 1.t \nTr. 94, 126 \n1.x \nCredit union \n$470 \n$5 payment \nrejected \nGX 6 at 4; AX A at \n2 \n1.y \nCar repossession \n$3,244 \nDuplicate of \u00b6 1.j \nTr. 94, 126 \n1.z \nMedical \n$302 \nUnresolved \nTr. 126-131 \n1.aa \nMedical \n$226 \nUnresolved \nTr. 126-131 \n1.bb \nMedical \n$226 \nUnresolved \nTr. 126-131 \n1.cc \nMedical \n$50 \nUnresolved \nTr. 126-131 \n1.dd \nCredit card \n$1,417 \nPaid $5  \n(no receipt) \nTr. 132 \n1.ee \nCollection agency \n$545 \nDuplicate of \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.z-1.cc \nTr. 132-33 \n1.ff \nPayday loan \n$540 \nUnresolved \nTr. 133-335 \n \n\n5 \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d \nRegulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3. The standard that must be met for \nassignment to sensitive duties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness \nare such that assigning the person to sensitive duties is \u201cclearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security.\u201d Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1. Department of Defense contractor \npersonnel are entitled to the procedural protections in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive information.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction an evaluation of the whole \nperson. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security. The government \nmust present substantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14. Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by \nsubstantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government. See \nISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant has the ultimate \nburden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or \ncontinue eligibility for access to sensitive information.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 32 delinquent debts totaling about $23,000, including 13 \nunsatisfied judgments and one car repossession. The trustworthiness concern under \nthis guideline is set out in AG & 18:   \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n\n6 \n \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial history is sufficient to raise the disqualifying conditions in AG \n& 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG & 19(c) (a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations). Accordingly, she has the burden to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \n \n \nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.u, 1.y, 1.w, and 1.ee duplicate the debts alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, 1.k, 1.t, and 1.z-cc. When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR \nunder the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in \nApplicant=s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) (same \ndebt alleged twice). Accordingly, I will resolve SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.u, 1.y, 1.w, and 1.ee in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe behavior \nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 20(a). This mitigating condition is not \nestablished, because Applicant\u2019s debts are numerous, not yet fully resolved, and did not \noccur under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. Her precarious financial \nsituation makes recurrence likely. Her financial history casts doubt on her current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated if Athe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ AG & 20(b). The \nvandalism of Applicant\u2019s apartment was beyond her control, but she did not respond \nreasonably. Four separate judgments were entered against her, starting in 1994, before \nshe finally resolved the debt. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(c). This \nmitigating condition is not established because Applicant has not received financial \ncounseling and her financial problems are not under control. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 \nWL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).  \n \n\n7 \n \n \nAn applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish resolution of each \nand every debt alleged in the SOR. See ADP Case No. 06-18900 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, \n2008). An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. \nMay 21, 2008). There also is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the \nSOR be paid first. Id. \n \nApplicant receives some credit for her efforts to resolve her debts. She satisfied \nsome of the judgments against her before receiving the SOR, and she has tendered \nsmall payments to some of her creditors. On the other hand, she has no overall plan to \nresolve her financial problems and does not appear to have the financial acumen \nrequired to develop a plan. She made the $5 payments only once, which is insufficient \nto constitute a track record or an established payment plan. She has not responded to \nthe settlement offers from the creditors alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p and 1.t. I conclude AG \u00b6 \n20(d) is not fully established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthe \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(e). Applicant \ntestified that she does not owe the cell phone debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.n and the \nmedical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.z-1.cc, but she did not provide documentation to \nsupport her disputes, nor has she contacted the creditors or filed disputes with the credit \nreporting agencies. This mitigating condition is not fully established.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for an \nassignment to a public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of \n\n8 \n \nthe factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under that guideline(s), but some warrant \nadditional comment.  \n \n \nApplicant appears to be hard-working and dedicated to her job. She is dedicated \nto her children. She presented herself as intelligent, articulate, candid, and sincere at \nthe hearing. On the other hand, she is not in control of her financial situation, and she \nlacks the knowledge and experience to know how to gain control. Unless she increases \nher income or decreases her expenses, she will remain vulnerable to exploitation and \npressure. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, \nand evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nhas not mitigated the trustworthiness concerns based on financial considerations. \nAccordingly, I conclude she has not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with national security to grant her eligibility for assignment to a public trust \nposition.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR:  \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.g: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.h-1.l: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.n-1.t: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.u:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.v:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.w:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.x:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.y:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.z-1.dd:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.ee:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.ff:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant a favorable trustworthiness \ndetermination.

Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn April 17, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP).1 On January 23, 2009, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant \nto Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.2 The SOR alleges security \n \n1  Item 4. \n \n2  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nJune 29, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                            \nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The SOR detailed reasons why \nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nhim, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn March 11, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to \nhave his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the \nfile of relevant material (FORM), dated April 7, 2009, was provided to him, and he was \nafforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, \nor mitigation.3 The case was assigned to me on June 2, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his responses to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.d., and 1.f. \nHe denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c., and 1.e. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of \nfact. After a thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 46-year-old project manager, who has been employed by his \ndefense contractor employer since June 2003.4 His e-QIP indicates he has been \nattending an on-line college since January 2008. The FORM does not contain any \nfurther information regarding Applicant\u2019s educational background. He has been married \nsince October 1987, and has a 19-year-old daughter and a 10-year-old son. Applicant \ndid not serve in the military. His e-QIP disclosed no police record; no use of illegal \ndrugs; and no alcohol-related problems, counseling or treatment. Applicant successfully \nheld a secret security clearance from 1990 to 2003. \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed his financial problems and \nincluded the review of his Response to SOR, April 2008 e-QIP, May 2008, August 2008, \nApril 2009 credit reports, and two October 2008 Answers to Interrogatories.5 \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant has five delinquent debts approximating $16,184.00. \nIn addition to those debts admitted by Applicant, all alleged debts are independently \nsupported by Applicant\u2019s e-QIP, and his May 2008, August 2008, and April 2009 credit \n \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006.  \n \n3 The DOHA transmittal letter is dated April 7, 2009. Applicant signed the receipt for the DOHA \ntransmittal letter on April 13, 2008. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 days \nafter receipt of the FORM to submit information. Applicant did not submit any additional information. \n \n4 Item 5 (e-QIP) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless stated otherwise. \n \n5 Items 4 - 9. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \nreports.6 As noted above, Applicant\u2019s Answer denied he owes the debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.c., and 1.e.; however, he has provided no evidence to prove or support his \nassertions. Even if Applicant\u2019s assertions are correct, the delinquent debts alleged in the \nSOR to which he admits are $13,110.00. \n \nApplicant filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1997. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) In his Response to \nSOR, he stated he did so under advice of counsel \u201cto protect (an) active security \nclearance which was active from 1990 to 2000.\u201d \n \nApplicant\u2019s Response to SOR stated the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b. was \u201ccurrently in \ndispute and . . . scheduled to fall of[f] credit report by 2nd qtr 2009,\u201d the debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.c. was \u201c[n]ot on [his] current credit report,\u201d the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d. was \u201ccurrently in \ndispute and . . .  scheduled to fall of[f] of credit report by 2nd qtr 2009,\u201d the debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.e. \u201cis under dispute, this was not my account. Unable to close with . . . because acct is \nnot in the . . . system,\u201d and the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f. \u201cwas for a vehicle that was returned to \nbank and account closed 2003. No agreement to pay balance required from original \nbank due to value of vehicle was higher tha[n] outstanding balance. I was 60 day[s] \nbehind on this account.\u201d7  \n \nApplicant\u2019s Response to SOR failed to adequately address any of his delinquent \ndebts. He failed to provide sufficient information as to how he acquired the debts, why \nthey became delinquent, what efforts he took, if any, to resolve his debts, \ndocumentation to support his Response to SOR, and what measures he has taken to \navoid similar financial problems in the future. \n \nApplicant did not submit any character references or performance evaluations. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \n \n6 Items 7 and 8. \n \n7 Item 3. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d8 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).9 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \n \n \n8 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 \nF.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n9 \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the relevant security concern is under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, his answers to \nDOHA interrogatories, and his SOR response.  \n \nApplicant has submitted no documentation to show he has a reasonable basis to \ndispute the legitimacy of the debts alleged, that he has attempted to contact those or \nother creditors to settle or resolve the debts alleged in the SOR, or that he is receiving \ncounseling or has ever received financial counseling to assist him with his financial \ndifficulties.  \n \nApplicant also has not produced convincing evidence showing that he acted \nresponsibly or prudently in managing his financial affairs over several years, and it is \nclear from the record evidence that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are longstanding, are \nnot isolated, and appear likely to be a continuing concern in the future.  \n \nApplicant admitted three of the five debts alleged and those three debts \napproximate $13,110.00, although he disputed two of those admitted debts without \nexplanation. The Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c). Absent favorable evidence and considering the record as a whole, I conclude \nhis five SOR debt are still valid, delinquent debts, and that Applicant is responsible for \nthem.  \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                           \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,10 I conclude that none of the \nmitigating conditions apply and Applicant\u2019s sparse favorable information fails to \nestablish the applicability of any of the mitigating conditions. Applicant\u2019s debts were \nincurred after his 1997 chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge. Having been relieved of debt \nliability in 1997, he subsequently incurred substantial debt as discussed supra. His \nstated intention of waiting for debts to \u201cfall off credit report\u201d does not demonstrate \nfinancial responsibility.  \n \nAccordingly, Applicant\u2019s financial history and lack of favorable evidence preclude \na finding that he has established a track record of financial responsibility, or that he has \ntaken control of his financial situation. Based on the available evidence, his financial \nproblems are recent, not isolated, and are likely to be a concern in the future. He has \nnot carried his burden of proving his financial responsibility. His overall financial \nbehavior casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n \n10  See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 \nat 4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for AG \u00b6 20(a), all debts are considered \nas a whole. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nApplicant\u2019s record of employment working for a government contractor weighs in \nhis favor.  He previously held a security clearance without any known security violations. \nAside from his delinquent debts, which are a civil, non-criminal issue, he is a law-\nabiding citizen. These factors show some responsibility and mitigation.   \n \nThe evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct is more substantial. He has \na significant history of delinquent debt that has been ongoing. Applicant has submitted \nno documentation to show he has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \ndebts, that he has attempted to contact those or other creditors to settle or resolve \ndebts alleged in the SOR, or that he is receiving or has ever received financial \ncounseling to assist him with his financial difficulties. Applicant has not produced \nconvincing evidence showing that he has acted responsibly or prudently in managing \nhis financial affairs over several years, and it is clear from the record that Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial problems are longstanding, not isolated, and appear likely to be a continuing \nconcern in the future. Accordingly, Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns \ncaused by the financial considerations in his case. \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to financial considerations.    \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \n \n Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. to 1.f.: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nROBERT J. TUIDER \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On April 28, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Department Counsel requested a hearing.  On November 30, 2009, after the\nhearing, Administrative Judge Marc E. Curry denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the issue of whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable decision. \nThe Judge found that Applicant began to experience financial difficulties between 2004 and\n2008, during which time Applicant accumulated approximately $33,000 in delinquent debt.\nApproximately $29,000 of the debt resulted from deficiencies arising out of the voluntary\nrepossession of two automobiles. Applicant also has a $2,742 tuition payment delinquency from a\nuniversity.  Applicant attributes his financial problems to a series of family crises, including a\nsibling\u2019s cancer and subsequent death, his father\u2019s stroke and subsequent death, and his marital\nseparation.  Applicant paid the funeral expenses of his deceased family members.  Applicant recently\nconsulted a financial counselor and has created a budget and a spending plan.  Applicant completed\na security clearance application in 2006.  In response to a question that required disclosure of such\ninformation, Applicant did not list the fact that his security clearance had been suspended in 2000\nand 2004.  Applicant characterized these omissions as mistakes caused by his preoccupation with\nhis family problems at the time he completed the application.  Applicant claimed he realized his\nmistake shortly thereafter and intended to disclose the correct information upon meeting with an\ninvestigating agent.  When Applicant met with the agent, he did not disclose the information because\nhis mind set was not very clear at the time.\nThe Judge concluded that, although Applicant had recently begun satisfying some of his\ndebts, the majority of his debts remain outstanding.  Applicant has yet to make plans to begin\nsatisfying a debt that constitutes more than a third of his total debt delinquency, and he recently\nmissed a payment toward the satisfaction of another debt despite the fact that his budget indicates\nthat he should have substantial income to pay his debts.  The Judge also concluded that Applicant\u2019s\nexplanation for his omissions from his security clearance application was not credible.       \nApplicant argues that financial circumstances and personal conduct are not conclusive to\nprovide an unfavorable decision to revoke or deny all security clearances.  Applicant asserts that\nthere appear to be many arguments in the Judge\u2019s decision that are open to interpretation, which\nshould have led to a more favorable or conditional decision.  Applicant maintains that he never\nintentionally concealed information on his security clearance application and that his efforts at debt\nreduction should be mitigating.  These contentions do not establish error on the part of the Judge.\nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\n\n3\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd.\nOct. 12, 2007).  \nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  He discussed the applicability of Guideline F mitigating conditions and\nexplained why, despite some evidence in mitigation, that mitigation was of insufficient strength to\novercome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Judge stressed the facts that Applicant\u2019s debts\nare largely unresolved and that the amount of disposable income listed in his current budget is not\nan accurate barometer of Applicant\u2019s financial well-being.  Regarding Guideline E, the Judge\u2019s\nconclusion that Applicant\u2019s explanation for why he did not reveal required information was not\ncredible is sustainable on this record.\n  \nApplicant mentions the granting of a conditional clearance as a possible appropriate outcome\nfor this case.  Neither DOHA Hearing Office administrative judges nor the Board has the authority\nto grant conditional clearances.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-32842 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2004).\nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for\nhis decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)\n(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe general\nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the\nnational security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

Although Applicant has recently begun\nsatisfying some of his debts, the majority remains outstanding. Also, Applicant\u2019s\nexplanation for his omissions from the security clearance application was not credible.\nClearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nOn April 28, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines\nF, Financial Considerations, and E, Personal Conduct. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\nNovember 30, 2009\n\n2\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 5, 2009, admitting all of the allegations\nexcept SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 2.a, and 2.b, and requesting a decision without a hearing. The case\nwas assigned to me on August 28, 2009, after Department Counsel requested a\nhearing. On September 4, 2009, a notice of hearing was issued scheduling the case for\nSeptember 24, 2009. On September 23, 2009, the case was transferred to another\njudge. On the date of the hearing, Applicant moved for a continuance. The motion was\ngranted, and the case was returned to me, whereupon a notice of hearing was issued\non October 1, 2009, rescheduling it for October 21, 2009. The hearing was conducted\nas scheduled. I received seven government exhibits, nine Applicant exhibits, and\nApplicant\u2019s testimony. The transcript was received on October 29, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 52-year-old married man. An earlier marriage ended in divorce. He\nhas three children from his current wife, ages 19, 14, and 9, and two children, ages 18\nand 23, from his ex-wife. He has a bachelor of science degree in information technology\nmanagement, earned in 2007 (Exhibit 3 at 7). Currently, he is working toward an MBA in\nthe same field.\nApplicant served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1979 through his retirement in\n2006 (Exhibit 1 at 6). He served the first four years as a reservist. He was a master\nsergeant (E-8) when he retired (Tr. 20). Currently, Applicant works for a defense\ncontractor as a deputy project manager specializing in public key inscription (Tr. 21;\nExhibit I). Specifically, he writes \u201cpolicies for operational, technical, and management for\nthe security of a network\u201d (Tr. 21). \nApplicant\u2019s employer is pleased with his work performance. Applicant \u201chas lead\n[sic] his team to many project milestone successes and has worked tirelessly under\nextreme pressure and deadlines without complaint (Exhibit I).\nBetween 2004 and 2008, Applicant accrued $33,000 of delinquent debt.\nApproximately $29,000 of these delinquencies constitute the deficiencies from two\nautomobiles that were voluntarily repossessed (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b). The remainder\ninclude a delinquent tuition payment (SOR \u00b6 1.c), two phone bills (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f), and\na debt owed to a bank (SOR \u00b6 1.e). \nApplicant purchased the automobile, referenced in SOR \u00b6 1.a, in 2000 (Exhibit 5\nat 2). He returned it in 2003 because he could neither stay current with the payments\nnor afford a settlement plan the dealer offered (Tr. 23). As of November 2008, the\ndeficiency balance was approximately $16,000 (Answer). \nIn mid-2009, Applicant contacted the dealer and negotiated a settlement\narrangement. Under the plan, the total payoff was reduced by 70 percent, payable in\n\n3\nmonthly $316 increments (Exhibit A at 2). This plan was effective so long as Applicant\ncompleted payment by February 2010 (Id.). Otherwise, Applicant would owe the original\ndelinquency amount.\nApplicant began executing the agreement in July 2009 (Id.). He made an\nadditional payment that month and the scheduled August payment (Id.). He missed the\nSeptember payment because of unexpected household expenses (Tr. 63). He\ncontacted the dealer who told him this would pose no problem so long as he paid the\nentire negotiated settlement by February 2010, as agreed (Tr. 63). Since then, Applicant\npaid the October payment as scheduled (Exhibit A at 2).\nIn March 2006, Applicant financed the purchase of a car with the loan referenced\nin SOR \u00b6 1.b (Exhibit 5 at 1). By late 2008, he was unable to make the payments\n(Exhibit 6 at 2). In 2009, the car was voluntarily repossessed. Recently, the delinquency\nwas transferred to a collection agency (Tr. 24). Applicant has not yet contacted the\ncollection agent, but intends to develop a payment plan in the future (Tr. 24). \nApplicant owes $2,742 in delinquent tuition payments to the university where he\nis pursuing his MBA (Answer). Applicant had been receiving partial tuition\nreimbursement from the Marine Corps (Exhibit 3 at 4). He lost track of the tuition\nreimbursements, and mistakenly thought the Marine Corps\u2019s tuition reimbursement\nprogram would satisfy this debt (Id.; Tr. 28). The debt has been outstanding for two\nyears (Tr. 26). \nBy May 2009, Applicant had begun satisfying the $321 delinquent phone bill\nlisted in SOR \u00b6 1.d through incremental payments (Exhibit B). He satisfied it in full in\nOctober 2009 (Exhibit B at 2). I resolve SOR \u00b6 1.d in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nApplicant disputes the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.e, in the amount of $1,137. He\nprovided no evidence supporting the basis of the dispute (Tr. 28). In response to\ngovernment interrogatories in October 2008, Applicant stated that he was working on a\npayment option (Exhibit 4 at 3).\nOne of Applicant\u2019s children accrued the phone bill listed in SOR \u00b6 1.f (Tr. 28). As\nof November 2008, the balance was $816 (Answer). Applicant negotiated a settlement\nof this account for approximately $555 (Tr. 29). Under the plan, Applicant was to have\nsatisfied the debt by June 2009 (Answer). He made his first payment in September\n2009, in the amount of $200 (Exhibit 6). Approximately $355 remains outstanding\n(Exhibit C).\nApplicant attributes his financial problems to a series of family crises that\noccurred between 2004 and 2008. In 2004, his sister was diagnosed with cancer (Tr.\n29). He then began assisting her with her bills. In the process, many of his bills \u201cgot\ndeferred in order to alleviate some of her stress\u201d (Tr. 29). \n\nThe financial counselor\u2019s plan actually lists after-expense income of $1,301. It did not, however, include the\n1\n$316 per month Applicant is paying to satisfy the auto deficiency, as listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a.\nYOUR INVESTIGATIONS RECORD     b. To your knowledge, have you ever had a clearance or access\n2\nauthorization denied, suspended, or revoked, or have you ever been debarred from government employment?\nIf \u201cYes\u201d, give date of action and agency. Note: An administrative downgrade or termination of a security\nclearance is not a revocation.\n4\nIn 2007, Applicant\u2019s father suffered a disabling stroke (Tr. 30). Because his father\nwas indigent, Applicant decided to forego his own financial obligations and take care of\nhis father\u2019s financial obligations (Tr. 30). Later that year, Applicant\u2019s father died (Tr. 30).\nApplicant paid more than $10,000 of funeral expenses and debt that his father had\naccrued (Tr. 80).\nLater that year, Applicant\u2019s sister and his father\u2019s live-in girlfriend died (Tr. 30).\nHe paid for their funerals, also (Tr. 31).\nFrom November 2007 through December 2008, Applicant was separated from\nhis wife (Tr. 79). His ability to satisfy his delinquencies was further impeded by the costs\nof maintaining the apartment where he moved when they separated (Tr. 31). They have\nsince reconciled, and currently live together.\nApplicant consulted a financial counselor in September 2009 (Exhibit D). With the\nhelp of the counselor, Applicant created a budget and a spending plan (Id.). Under the\nbudget, Applicant has approximately $1,000 of after-expense income  (Exhibit D at 5). \n1\nApplicant\u2019s access to classified material was temporarily suspended from April 9,\n2004, through April 17, 2004, because of his unauthorized storage of classified material\n(Tr. 36; Exhibit 7 at 2). After the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) conducted\nan investigation, \u201ca favorable personnel security determination was made,\u201d and\nApplicant\u2019s clearance was reinstated (Exhibit 7 at 1).\nIn 1998, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving while under the\ninfluence of alcohol (Exhibit 3 at 6). This incident, along with a spousal battery charge,\nand three delinquent accounts prompted the Department of the Navy Central\nAdjudication Facility (DONCAF) to issue a Letter of Intent to Revoke Security Clearance\nand Deny Eligibility for Access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (LOI) in 2000\n(Exhibit 7; Exhibit 4 at 17). While the LOI was pending, his security clearance  was\nsuspended (Id.). After considering Applicant\u2019s response, the DONCAF reinstated his\nclearance conditionally (Exhibit 7 at 2; Exhibit 3 at 7). The conditions for retaining the\nclearance are unknown from the record.\nApplicant completed a security clearance application in 2006 (Exhibit 2). In\nresponse to Section 26b,  he did not list the suspension of his security clearance in\n2\n2004, nor the suspension of his security clearance in 2000. Applicant characterized\nthese omissions as mistakes caused by his preoccupation with his family problems\nwhen he completed the application (Tr. 32). He realized his mistake shortly after\n\n5\ncompleting the security clearance application and intended to disclose the correct\ninformation upon meeting with an investigative agent (Tr. 32). Applicant met with an\ninvestigative agent, as anticipated, but did not disclose the information, because \u201chis\nmind set was not very clear\u201d at the time (Tr. 32).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d Applicant\nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information\u201d\n(AG \u00b6 18). Applicant\u2019s history of financial delinquencies triggers the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6\n19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant accrued the majority of his delinquent debts at or about the same time\nhis sister and father were stricken with disabling illnesses. His finances grew strained in\nthe process of supporting them through their illnesses and subsequent deaths. His\n\n6\nfinances were further exacerbated by a 13-month marital separation between November\n2007 and December 2008.\nIn September 2009, Applicant met with a financial counselor and developed a\nbudget. Since then, he has been paying the delinquencies listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.f\nthrough payment plans, and has satisfied SOR \u00b6 1.d in full. AG \u00b6 20(b), the conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss\nof employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d\nand AG \u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem . . .\u201d\napply.\nApplicant provided no evidence corroborating his dispute of the debt listed in\nSOR \u00b6 1.e. AG \u00b6 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy\nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof\nto substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the\nissue,\u201d does not apply. Nevertheless, I conclude Applicant\u2019s efforts toward debt\nsatisfaction are sufficient to trigger the application of AG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated\na good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors, or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d\nI am not persuaded that Applicant\u2019s history of financial difficulties no longer\nposes a security concern. His most recent automobile repossession occurred less than\n18 months ago (SOR \u00b6 1.b). The resulting deficiency constitutes more than a third of his\nremaining outstanding delinquent debt, and Applicant has yet to make plans to begin\nsatisfying it. Moreover, although Applicant\u2019s budget indicates that he should have\nsubstantial income to pay his debts, he missed a payment toward the satisfaction of the\nautomobile deficiency, listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a, in September 2009, claiming that other\nhousehold expenses were out of control that month. Consequently, the amount of\ndisposable income listed in his budget is not an accurate barometer of Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial well-being.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation\u201d (AG \u00b6 15). \nApplicant\u2019s failure to list the past suspensions of his security clearance from his\n2006 security clearance application raises the issue of whether AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities,\u201d applies. Applicant\u2019s explanation was, in sum, that he mistakenly\nomitted the information from the security clearance application, realized his mistake and\n\n7\nintended to tell the investigator, then accidentally neglected to inform the investigator\nupon meeting him. I conclude Applicant\u2019s explanation was not credible. AG \u00b6 16(a)\napplies without mitigation.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nCircumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed significantly to the accrual\nof his delinquencies. Although he has made some progress toward addressing his\ndebts, he has yet to establish a demonstrated track record of financial reform sufficient\nto conclude that he has mitigated the financial considerations security concern.\nMoreover, his reassurances that his finances are under control were undermined by the\nlack of credibility displayed in falsifying his security clearance application. Upon\nevaluating this case in the context of the whole person concept, I conclude Applicant\nhas not mitigated the financial considerations and personal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.e  - 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Howry, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nJuly 30, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on January 8, 2008.  On March 11, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not make\nthe preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance\nshould be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant answered the SOR in writing on April 6, 2009, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to the undersigned\nAdministrative Judge on May 7, 2009.  A notice of hearing was issued on May 27, 2009,\nscheduling the hearing for June 30, 2009.  The Government offered four exhibits,\nreferred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 4, which were received without objection.\nApplicant called one witness, offered two exhibits, referred to Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A and\nB, and testified on his own behalf.  The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on\n\n \n2\nJuly 9, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 51 years old and has Bachelor\u2019s Degrees in Electrical\nEngineering and Math, and a Master\u2019s of Science in Computer Science.  He is\nemployed by a defense contractor as a Senior Hardware Engineer, and is applying for a\nsecurity clearance in connection with his employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he engaged in conduct\ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations that raise questions about his ability to protect classified\ninformation.   \nParagraph 2 (Guideline M - Use of Information Technology Systems).  The Government\nalleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because his\nnoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations pertaining to\ninformation technology systems may raise security concerns about an individual\u2019s\nreliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the willingness or ability to properly\nprotect sensitive systems, networks, and information.\nParagraph 3 (Guideline D - Sexual Behavior).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because his sexual behavior\ninvolved a criminal offense, is indicative of a personality or emotional disorder, reflects\nlack of judgment or discretion, or may subject the individual to undue influence or\ncoercion, or reflects lack of judgment or discretion.  \nThe Applicant admits to the allegations set forth in the SOR under the respective\nguidelines set forth above.  Those admissions are deemed findings of fact.\nThe Applicant began working for defense contractor #1 in March 1984.  While\nemployed for contractor #1, the Applicant used the company computer to access\npornographic adult web sites during company time on a sporadic basis from October\n2000 through 2005.  In October 2000, the Applicant received a letter of reprimand for\nthis violation.\nAgain, from November 2004 through March 2005, the Applicant used contractor\n#1's computer to access and download non-business related internet web pages while\nemployed there.  After twenty-one years of employment with this defense contractor, in\nMarch 2005, in lieu of being terminated for the inappropriate use of the internet and mis-\n\n \n3\ncharging of time against the Government contract shop orders, the Applicant resigned\nfrom his position at the company. \nFrom March 2005 through August 2005, the Applicant was unemployed.  During\nthat time, he states that he consulted with some experts in the area of job search who\ntold him not to fully disclose why he was terminated, but to use a three step approach.\nThe Applicant testified that, \u201cThe first, when I was asked what was the reason for\nleaving, I would respond, I left for personal reasons.  If they wanted more information\nthan that, they would ask in which case I would say the HR had issues with me that\nwere not related to my performance and if they still had, they wanted to know more then\nI would give them the details which would have been telling them about violation of\ncompany policy with regards to use of the computers.\u201d  (Tr. p. 31).\nApplicant indicates that while interviewing for a job, some defense contractors\nasked all three questions and so he disclosed all of the details.  Other potential\nemployers only asked the first question, so he never revealed the full details. \nOn his June 2005 application for employment with defense contractor #2, the\nApplicant failed to disclose the circumstances of his previous employment termination.\nApplicant simply stated that he terminated his employment with a previous defense\ncontractor because of personal issues with Human Resources.  He failed to disclose\nthat he resigned from his position in lieu of being terminated due to his improper use of\nthe company\u2019s computer.  Applicant testified that in responding to the question on his\napplication for employment, the space only allowed a few words.  He was not trying to\nmislead the company; and had they asked, he would have provided a more thorough\nexplanation.\nIn August 2005, while employed with defense contractor #2, the Applicant used\nhis company computer to visit web sites that could be construed as borderline\npornographic, against company policy.  Applicant was aware at the time that he was\nviolating company policy by visiting these pornographic or borderline pornographic web\nsites, but at the time did not realize that he was battling an addiction.\nThe Applicant testified that he has been working on his disorder since 1993.  (Tr.\np. 69).  It took until March 2009, for him to realize that he is addicted to internet\npornography.  (Tr. p. 36).  Prior to March 2009, he had been discussing the problem\nwith his pastor at his church, but realized that he needed deeper counseling.  Applicant\ntestified that even though he had the motivation and will power to stop internet\npornography, he wanted and needed to figure out for himself why he was engaging in\nthis conduct.  (Tr. p. 37).  \nIn April 2009, he began seeing a licensed social worker on a weekly basis and\nplans to continue indefinitely.  (Tr. p. 70).  Since then the Applicant has seen some\namazing changes in his life.  His relationships with people at work, family, church and\nGod are the best they have ever been.  Applicant has currently not viewed  pornography\nfor 111 days, as of the hearing.  Applicant has learned that his addiction to internet\npornography led him to disobey company policy and procedure.  He is deeply\n\n \n4\nembarrassed by the conduct.  He also contends that although he spent company time\nwrongfully viewing pornography, he made up the time after hours by working late.  He\nindicates that the logs of his time that were presented by company #1 to show that he\nabused company time, were only logs that included his time spent in the main facility.\nThe Applicant contends that he had also been working on an off-site facility, but there\nwere no time logs kept of that time spent at work.  \nThe Applicant\u2019s pastor, who has counseled the Applicant for his addiction,\ntestified that the Applicant, who is very active in the church, is extremely honest, faithful\nin fulfilling his responsibilities and trustworthy.  He has also observed that the Applicant\nhas progressively improved and changed since counseling with the social worker.  (Tr.\npp. 75 -77).  \nA number of company e-mail correspondence to and/or from the Applicant\nattests to his security consciousness.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).  \nLetters of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s current Program Manager, a\nfriend and professional associate involved in the church, his daughter and his wife attest\nto his character traits of trustworthiness, dedication and commitment at work and to his\nfamily and friends.  He is considered responsible and a man of integrity.  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit B).   \nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the\nDepartment of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors\nand conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given\nbinding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors\nshould be followed in every case according to the pertinent guidelines.  However, the\nconditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can\nthey supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and\ncircumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human\nexperience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth\nabove, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\n\n \n5\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n16(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to\nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities;\n16(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other\nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which,\nwhen combined with all available information supports a whole-person assessment of\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person\nmay not properly safeguard protected information.  This includes but is not limited to\nconsideration of:\n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations;\n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer\u2019s time or\nresources.  \nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\n(Guideline M - Use of Information Technology Systems).  \n39.\nThe Concern.  Noncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations\npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the willingness or ability\nto properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and information.  Information\nTechnology Systems include all related computer hardware, software, manipulation,\nstorage, or protection of information. \nConditions that could raise a security concerns:\n40(a) illegal or unauthorized entry into any information technology system or\ncomponent thereof;\n40(e) unauthorized use of a government or other information technology system;\n40(h) any misuse of information technology, whether deliberate or negligent, that\nresults in damage to the national security.\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:  \nNone.\n\n \n6\nGuideline D - Sexual Behavior\n12.   The Concern.  Sexual Behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a\npersonality or emotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may\nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or duress can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  No adverse inference concerning the standards in this Guideline may be\nraise solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the individual.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n13(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual behavior that\nthe person is unable to stop to that may be symptomatic of a personality disorder; \n13(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion,\nexploitation, or duress;\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na. The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc. The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd. The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne. The voluntariness of participation\nf. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng. The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\n\n \n7\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\neligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is\npredicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The\nadjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the\nwhole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination. \nThe Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw\ninferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in\nnature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865,\n\u201cAny determination under this order . . .  shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline E (Personal Conduct),\nGuideline M (Information Technology) and Guideline D (Sexual Behavior) that\nestablishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a\nrational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct and\nhis ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of\nproof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in\nrefutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past\nadverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for\na security clearance.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of\nconfidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations,\nat all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSION\nHaving considered the evidence in light of the appropriate legal standards and\nfactors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the record, this\nAdministrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its case as to all\nallegations in the SOR, and that Applicant's pattern of inappropriate sexual behavior\nand personal conduct has a direct and negative impact on his suitability for access to\nclassified information.  \nThe Applicant admits that his addiction to internet pornography has caused him\nserious problems at work.  He has viewed pornographic web sites on company\ncomputers, downloaded non-business related internet web sites, and was ultimately\nforced to resign instead of being fired for this misconduct.  He knew at the time that he\nengaged in the conduct that he was violating company policies.  Furthermore, he was\n\n \n8\nnot candid with prospective employers regarding the reason for his job resignation.\nConsidering the evidence in totality, this demonstrates a pattern of inappropriate\npersonal conduct, misuse of information technology and sexual behavior, which\npresents high risk conduct that could subject the Applicant to pressure, coercion and/or\nblackmail, which in turn could subject the Government to a security risk.  \nApplicant\u2019s high risk behavior places him in a vulnerable position to be\nsusceptible to pressure, coercion and/or blackmail.  He has just recently come to grips\nwith his addiction.  His addiction is a pattern of compulsive sexual behavior that he\ncannot stop.  He is receiving counseling to combat his urges to access pornographic\nsites.  At the present time, however, the risk is great that the Applicant may fall prey to\nexploitation, coercion or duress.  Applicant\u2019s pattern of high risk behavior places the\nnational interest at significant risk.  \nUnder Guideline E, Disqualifying Conditions 16(a) deliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities, and 16(d) credible\nadverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not\nbe sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all\navailable information supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly\nsafeguard protected information.  This includes but is not limited to consideration of: . . .\n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, and (4) evidence of significant misuse of\nGovernment or other employer\u2019s time or resources apply.  None of the mitigating\nconditions are applicable.  The Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that\nhis personal conduct does not raise a security concern, and Guideline E is found\nagainst the Applicant. \nUnder Guideline M, Disqualifying Conditions 40(a) illegal or unauthorized entry\ninto any information technology system or component thereof, 40(e) unauthorized use\nof a government or other information technology system, and 40(h) any misuse of\ninformation technology, whether deliberate or negligent, that results in damage to the\nnational security apply.  None of the mitigation conditions are applicable.  The Applicant\nhas not met his burden of demonstrating that his misuse of information technology does\nnot raise a security concern, and Guideline M is found against the Applicant.\nUnder Guideline D, Disqualifying Conditions 13(b), a pattern of compulsive, self-\ndestructive, or high risk sexual behavior that the person is unable to stop or that may be\nsymptomatic of a personality disorder and, 13(c), sexual behavior that causes an\nindividual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress apply.  None of the\nmitigating conditions are even remotely applicable.  The Applicant has not met his\nburden of demonstrating that his sexual behavior does not raise a security concern, and\nGuideline D is found against the Applicant.\n\n9\nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of poor judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, an\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or other characteristics\nindicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.\n  \nConsidering all of the evidence presented, it does not come close to mitigating\nthe negative effects of his poor personal conduct, misuse of information technology and\nsexual behavior, and the impact that they can have on his ability to properly safeguard\nclassified information.  On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to\novercome the Government's case opposing his request for a security clearance.\nAccordingly, the evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and\nconclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the SOR.    \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\n         Paragraph 1:  Against the Applicant.\n Subparagraph 1.a.: Against the Applicant\n            Subparagraph 1.b.: Against the Applicant\n     \n            Subparagraph 1.c.: Against the Applicant\n            Subparagraph 1.d.: Against the Applicant\n            Subparagraph 1.e.: Against the Applicant\nParagraph 2:  Against the Applicant\n Subparagraph 2.a.: Against the Applicant\n    Paragraph 3:  Against the Applicant.\n Subparagraph 3.a.:  Against the Applicant\n            Subparagraph 3.b.:  Against the Applicant\n \nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance\nfor the Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On June 16, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns\nunder Guideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn June 29, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing.\nDOHA received the request and the case was assigned to me on August 5, 2009.\nApplicant and Department Counsel agreed to a September 30, 2009 hearing date. On\nAugust 27, 2009, a Notice of Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing for that date.\nThe hearing was convened as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted five exhibits\n(GE) 1-5 without objection. Applicant submitted five exhibits (AE) A-E which were\nOctober 22, 2009\n\n2\nadmitted without objection. He testified on his own behalf. The transcript (Tr.) was\nreceived on October 6, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits,\nand testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his June 30, 2009 Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.k of the SOR with explanations. \nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school in 1992. He served in the U.S. Navy from 1995 until 2003. He obtained his\nundergraduate degree in naval aviation. Applicant married in 1999 and divorced in\n2009. He has two children from that marriage. He has worked for his current employer\nsince March 2006 (GE 1). \nApplicant\u2019s transition from his military career to civilian employment was difficult.\nHe was completing his college courses and trying to find employment. He was actively\nsearching for employment at least six months prior to his separation from the military\n(Tr. 31). He was not able to pay his bills in 2003-2004 due to unemployment. His first\nfull-time employment was in July 2004. He remained in that position until February\n2006. He earned approximately $34,000 a year. He could not sustain himself on that\nsalary. His home was foreclosed in 2005.\nThe SOR alleges eleven delinquent debts, including a voluntary auto\nrepossession and credit card accounts. The delinquent debts total approximately\n$40,000 (GE 3). Applicant contacted his creditors. He drained his savings and had only\na very small amount to offer his creditors. He explained that they were not willing to\nwork with him but wanted a full amount (Tr. ). He does not want to file for bankruptcy.\nHe told his employer about his financial situation when he was first employed.   \nApplicant has not received financial counseling. He does not have a repayment\nplan for any of his debts. He states he does not know how to contact many of the\ncreditors. However, he has received two raises during his current employment. He has\nnot used any of his almost $13,000 raise to pay any of his accounts. Some of his debts\nare small and could be paid or settled. He admitted at the hearing that he knows if he\nwaits seven years the debts will be removed from his credit reports. He also\nacknowledged that before he and his wife separated, he co-signed a loan for an\nexpensive auto in 2007. This car note required $800 a month.  \nApplicant\u2019s monthly net income is approximately $3,101. He also receives a\ncheck for disability. He is paying monthly child support in the amount of $1,101. He has\na retirement account. He sends money to his mother who is ill. He visits her in her home\ncountry. His student loans are in deferment. He has one credit card (Tr. 63).\nApplicant loves his job. He wants to continue his work. He loves this country. His\nemployer praises his performance in his position (AE C). He manages government\n\n3\nproperty. He is responsible and professional. He has received commendations and\nletters of appreciation for his work with his current employer (AE D). Applicant is\ndeemed a competent, dedicated employee (AE E).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\n\n4\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debts over time. He admits that he\nhas $40,000 in delinquent debt. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying\nconditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the concerns may be\nmitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual=s \ncurrent \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, \nor \ngood \njudgment.@ \nApplicant\nacknowledged that his delinquent debts have been in existence since 2004. He has not\npaid any of the accounts. He co-signed for an expensive car in 2007. This mitigating\ncondition does not apply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant\u2019s transition\nfrom the military to civilian life was difficult. He was unemployed for a period of time in\n2004. He did not earn very much money when he became employed. His separation\nand divorce also impacted his financial situation. This may have exacerbated the\nproblem, but he has not acted responsibly by paying the accounts. He has been steadily\nemployed since 2004. Some of the accounts were delinquent prior to that time. He has\nnot prioritized his debts. This mitigating condition is not applicable.\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\n\n5\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received financial counseling. He has not\nresolved the delinquent accounts. His efforts are insufficient to carry his burden in this\ncase. I conclude these mitigating conditions do not apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude they are insufficient to\novercome the Government\u2019s case. Applicant has been steadily employed since 2004.\nHe has worked for a defense contractor since 2006. While he noted that his separation\nand divorce contributed to his problems, he admitted that he is ultimately responsible for\nthe debts. When he learned of the delinquent accounts, he did not take action to resolve\nthe debts. \nApplicant has served honorably in the U.S. Navy. He is paying child support for\nhis daughter. He loves this country and wants to continue in his employment. He sends\nmoney to his mother who lives out of the country and is ill. He faced unemployment\nwhen leaving the military. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nissues.\n.\n\n6\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a: - 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In response to the amended SOR, Applicant admitted returns had not been filed as alleged, although she presented evidence raising considerable doubt as to whether returns were required for some years. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 60-year-old college graduate, who has been employed full-time by a defense contractor since April 2008 (Exs. 1, G). She was initially hired by the company as a part-time associate administrative assistant in April 2006 (Exs. 1, 2, G, Tr. 27, 53). She assumed full-time responsibilities in the security office as assistant FSO in June 2008 (Ex. G, Tr. 28). She seeks a security clearance for her duties, which include administering routine aspects of the DoD industrial security program within their local facility, performing internal security inspections, assisting in investigations of security violations, maintaining security education programs, and monitoring security procedures (Ex. F). Applicant was married from June 1973 until February 1978 (Exs. 1, 2). A daughter was born of this brief union in June 1976. On their divorce, Applicant became the primary custodial parent for her daughter (Ex. 1). In September 1979, Applicant left the teaching profession, and she went to work for her father, who holds patents for systems to track financial instruments, such as traveler checks, and to print insurance records on demand (Tr. 44-46). In 1981, Applicant, her ",

Marine, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nAs of September 2009, Applicant had not filed federal or state income tax returns\nfor tax years 1997 through 2008. Based on her income, returns were required for at\nleast tax years 1998 and 2008. Her efforts to contact the Internal Revenue Service\n(IRS) in June 2009 are not enough to overcome the security concerns raised by her\nfailure to file timely returns. Clearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on April 28, 2008. On April 1, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued to Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR) detailing the security\nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, that provided the basis for its\npreliminary decision to deny her a security clearance and to refer the matter to an\nadministrative judge. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nMarch 9, 2010\n\nAt the government\u2019s request, and with no objections from Applicant, her request for extension and\n1\nher May 28, 2009, response, were considered to be part of her Answer, since she made representations\ntherein concerning her contacts with the IRS.\nOn February 24, 2010, Applicant contacted me to inquire about when she could expect a decision\n2\nin her case. She referenced a request for expedited proceeding from her FSO in December 2009 of which I\nhad no prior knowledge. On February 24, 2010, I received a copy of the FSO\u2019s request for expedited\nconsideration, dated December 16, 2009.\nIn the original SOR, allegations 1.a and 1.b pertained to federal income tax issues, and it was unclear\n3\nwhat DOHA was alleging in SOR 1.a (\u201cYou have not failed [sic] your federal income tax from April 1998 to\npresent.\u201d).\n2\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense as of September 1, 2006.\nOn April 21, 2009, Applicant requested an extension to respond to the SOR. She\nsubmitted her response on May 28, 2009, and requested a hearing.  On June 10, 2009,\n1\nthe government notified Applicant of amendments to the SOR. Applicant was informed\nthat if she did not respond within 20 days of receipt, processing of her case would be\ndiscontinued. Applicant responded to the allegations on August 6, 2009. On August 12,\n2009, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing and to determine whether it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant. I scheduled a hearing for September 15, 2009.\nThe hearing was convened as scheduled. Three government exhibits (Exs. 1-3)\nwere admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted six\nexhibits (Exs. A-F) that were entered into the record without objection, as reflected in a\ntranscript (Tr.) received on September 24, 2009.\nAt Applicant\u2019s request, I held the record open until September 22, 2009, for her to\nsubmit a character reference from her employer\u2019s facility security officer (FSO). On\nSeptember 18, 2009, Applicant forwarded a reference from her FSO, which was entered\nas Exhibit G without objection.2\nProcedural Rulings\nOn June 10, 2009, the government moved to amend the SOR. The stated\njustification for the amendments was to correct clerical error. However, the government\nmaterially altered SOR 1.a by alleging that Applicant failed to file state income tax\nreturns for tax years 1997 through 2007. SOR 1.a as originally drafted pertained to\nfederal income taxes,  conduct that was already covered under SOR 1.b.\n3\nBefore the case is assigned to an administrative judge, Department Counsel has\nthe authority under \u00b6 E3.1.6 of the Directive to take appropriate action, including but not\nlimited to withdrawing the SOR if allegations are unfounded. By logical extension, and\nconsistent with \u00b6 E3.1.3, which requires a written SOR as detailed and comprehensive\nas the national security permits, Department Counsel may amend the allegations.\n\n3\nOnce the case has been assigned for a hearing, the DOHA administrative judge\nis authorized under \u00b6 E3.1.10 to \u201crule on questions on procedure, discovery, and\nevidence,\u201d including whether Applicant has been provided with notice and an adequate\nopportunity to respond to proposed SOR amendments. At her hearing on September\n15, 2009, Applicant did not object to the amendments, and she was prepared to\naddress the government\u2019s concerns as alleged in the amended SOR, including\nconcerning her failure to timely file state income tax returns. Accordingly, before the\nintroduction of any evidence, I allowed the amendments proposed by the government\non June 10, 2009.\nAfter Applicant presented her case, Department Counsel moved under \u00b6 E3.1.17\nof the Directive to amend the SOR to conform to Applicant\u2019s testimony that she had not\nfiled her income tax returns, state or federal, for 2008 as well as 1997 through 2007.\nApplicant did not object, or request additional time to respond, so I granted the motion.\nAccordingly, the SOR was amended, as follows:\n1.a. As of September 15, 2009, you had not filed your state income tax\nreturns for the tax years 1997 through 2008.\n1.b. As of September 15, 2009, you had not filed your federal income tax\nreturns for the tax years 1997 through 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nIn response to the amended SOR, Applicant admitted returns had not been filed\nas alleged, although she presented evidence raising considerable doubt as to whether\nreturns were required for some years. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and\ntranscript, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 60-year-old college graduate, who has been employed full-time by\na defense contractor since April 2008 (Exs. 1, G). She was initially hired by the\ncompany as a part-time associate administrative assistant in April 2006 (Exs. 1, 2, G,\nTr. 27, 53). She assumed full-time responsibilities in the security office as assistant FSO\nin June 2008 (Ex. G, Tr. 28). She seeks a security clearance for her duties, which\ninclude administering routine aspects of the DoD industrial security program within their\nlocal facility, performing internal security inspections, assisting in investigations of\nsecurity violations, maintaining security education programs, and monitoring security\nprocedures (Ex. F).\nApplicant was married from June 1973 until February 1978 (Exs. 1, 2). A\ndaughter was born of this brief union in June 1976. On their divorce, Applicant became\nthe primary custodial parent for her daughter (Ex. 1).\nIn September 1979, Applicant left the teaching profession, and she went to work\nfor her father, who holds patents for systems to track financial instruments, such as\ntraveler checks, and to print insurance records on demand (Tr. 44-46). In 1981,\n\nApplicant, her father, and two unrelated business partners are the current shareholders (Tr. 42). \n4\nApplicant testified that she had significant business losses that far exceeded her income (Tr. 61). She\n5\nprovided IRS Schedule K-1 forms showing business losses for 1998, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005,\n2007, and 2008 (Ex. E). She has been unable to find the forms for tax years 2000 and 2006 (Tr. 33), but\ncorporate returns were filed for those years (Tr. 55).\n4\nApplicant, her father, and two of her siblings (Ex. 1, Tr. 47), spun off the international\ndivision of her father\u2019s business into a separate company (Tr. 49).\nIn about 1989, Applicant\u2019s mother was diagnosed with brain cancer, and she died\nin 1990 (Tr. 38, 65). During his spouse\u2019s illness, Applicant\u2019s father ceded day-to-day\noperations of the company to his executive vice president and to Applicant\u2019s brother (Tr.\n47). They expanded based on an anticipated $5 million contract that did not materialize.\nTo get out of a financial bind, they went public with the company, and Applicant and her\nfather became contract employees of the new owner from 1990 to 1992. In 1992,\nApplicant and her father were separated from the company (Tr. 46-48), and Applicant\nand her daughter moved in with her father that September (Ex. 1, Tr. 38). Her father\npaid the mortgage on his social security benefit income. Applicant covered her own\nexpenses and she bought food for the household (Tr. 72). Applicant also assisted her\nelder sister, who had Down\u2019s Syndrome and was living in the family home (Tr. 67). Her\nsister attended a day program five days per week, and she was capable of functioning\nwithin her community (Tr. 67).\nApplicant\u2019s father operated a separate design and consulting firm (Tr. 43) with\nApplicant as one of the shareholders (Tr. 50).  Applicant handled the office\n4\nadministrative duties, including billing, but she also prepared reports and contract\nproposals, and interacted with customers in the U.S. and abroad (Ex. 1, Tr. 50). She\nwas compensated as an employee in the amount of $259 in 1997 (Ex. C). The company\nhad sufficient assets to pay Applicant a salary of $18,288 for 1998, and to employ a full-\ntime employee starting in 1998. Otherwise, the company contracted with only two others\non a part-time basis over the next ten years. Based on her shareholder returns filed for\ntax years 1998 through 2008, Applicant claimed significant personal business losses,5\nfrom highs of $82,552, for 1998, and $83,233, for 1999, to a low of $6,863 in 2008 (Ex.\nE). \nFrom 1999 through 2005, most, if not all, of Applicant\u2019s income came from part-\ntime employment leading lantern-light tours over the Christmas holidays (Tr. 51). Her\nsocial security earnings for 1999 were only $6,282, $453 in 2000, $1,470 in 2001, $231\nin 2002, $330 in 2003, $439 in 2004, and $589 in 2005 (Ex. C). Yet, she took pleasure\ntrips to Europe in 1999 and 2004, and went on a cruise to Bermuda in June 2001 (Ex.\n1). The trip in 2004 cost her about $3,000, and the cruise was about $700 (Tr. 76).\nAfter about two years of noticeable decline, Applicant\u2019s sister was diagnosed with\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease in 2004 (Tr. 67). In addition to caring for her sister and working in\nthe family business, Applicant began part-time employment, ten hours a week, with her\ncurrent defense contractor employer in April 2006 (Ex. 2, Tr. 53). Her social security\n\n5\nearnings increased to $4,644 in 2006 and $7,341 in 2007 (Ex. C), excluding part-time\nincome of up to $1,000 annually as a part-time retail candle consultant starting in 2006\n(Tr. 62-63). Applicant acknowledged she was responsible for reporting her income to\nthe IRS and paying any taxes due from her consulting work (Tr. 63).\nIn February 2008, Applicant and her father placed her sister in a group residential\nsetting when her sister could no longer be cared for safely in their home (Exs. 1, 2, Tr.\n64-65). They moved business operations into their home in an effort to make the\ncompany profitable (Ex. 2, Tr. 38, 41), and Applicant continued to work in the family\nbusiness for little to no pay (Ex. 2). In April 2008, Applicant began full-time employment\nwith the defense contractor, and she earned income of $24,150 that year, not counting\nany income from her independent consulting (Ex. C).\nOn April 28, 2008, Applicant applied for a top-secret security clearance for her\nduties (Tr. 91). In response to question 28.a on the e-QIP concerning whether she had\nbeen over 180 days delinquent on any debts in the last seven years, Applicant indicated\nthat she had not filed her federal tax returns since 1997 due to theft of her laptop\ncomputer containing all her financial records in the late fall of 1996, two office moves,\nno regular income since 1996, significant business and real estate losses, and primary\ncaretaker responsibilities for an elderly parent and an intellectually disabled sibling. She\nadded she was in the process of gathering her data to file her tax returns, which could\ntake another three to six months (Ex. 1).\nOn June 10, 2008, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator, in\npart about her failure to file income tax returns for tax years 1997 through 2007.\nApplicant indicated she had received no income from her work for her father since 1996\nwith the exception of tax year 1998. She cited her minimal income and her family\nresponsibilities as the reasons for her failure to file tax returns. Applicant asserted she\nwas in the process of acquiring the information needed to file the returns through her\naccountant, which she estimated would take three to six months (Ex. 2).\nThe family business remained unprofitable, and in October 2008, Applicant, her\nfather, her daughter, and her granddaughter vacated their 16-room home and moved\ninto an eight-room cottage owned by their neighbors (Tr. 73). Her father took one room\nfor his office (Ex. 1, Tr. 39), and he filed for bankruptcy to avoid foreclosure of the\nmortgage on the family home (Tr. 84). In December 2008, her father listed the family\nhome for sale. It had not sold by mid-September 2009 (Tr. 82).\nOn November 20, 2008, Applicant informed DOHA that she was still in the\nprocess of gathering the documents needed to file her personal income tax returns, and\nthat she would contact the IRS in early December 2008 to initiate the filing of delinquent\nreturns (Ex. 2). By late May 2009, Applicant had not been able to find her financial\nrecords in the boxes packed during her recent office and residential moves. At the\nsuggestion of a local IRS business agent who has dealt with the company\u2019s tax matters,\nApplicant sent a letter to the IRS in June 2009 asking for a literal transaction of her\naccounts and wage and compensation documents for the years 2001 to 2008. This was\nher first attempt to obtain all of the documents needed to file returns (Ex. A, Tr. 59-60).\n\n6\nThe IRS acknowledged receipt of her request on July 17, 2009 (Ex. B). As of\nSeptember 15, 2009, Applicant had not filed any income tax returns for tax years 1997\nthrough 2008. She had an extension to file her 2008 federal return until August 31, 2009\n(Tr. 77, 93), but she had not filed for an extension to file her state income tax return (Tr.\n90, 93). She planned to have the documentation needed to file her 2008 returns to her\naccountant by October 15, 2009, if not earlier (Tr. 77). But she was still missing her W-2\nfrom her defense contractor employment and her expense records from her\nindependent consulting in 2008 (Tr. 88).\nApplicant\u2019s annual salary from her defense contractor employment is about\n$33,000 (Tr. 77). Since October 2008, when they moved into a leased cottage,\nApplicant, her father, and her daughter have each contributed $500 monthly for the rent\n(Tr. 73, 81). Applicant purchases the groceries. Applicant has about $300 on deposit in\nher checking account and $12 in savings as of mid-September 2009. She had depleted\nall but $2,000 of $25,000 in individual retirement account assets when she was not\nreceiving a salary. Applicant is paying $300 per month toward $5,000 in credit card debt\nthat was incurred for clothing, groceries, and possibly to pay for her trip in 2004 (Tr. 72-\n75).\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor attests to Applicant having acted professionally and with\n\u201cextreme attention to detail\u201d in fulfilling her responsibilities in the security office.\nApplicant is involved in the community in several charitable endeavors that reflect\nfavorably on her character (Ex. G).\n \nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive\nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,\nemphasizing \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security\nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In\naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines\nlist potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to\nbe considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of\nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\n\n7\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the\ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern about finances is set out in AG \u00b6 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nApplicant admits that she has not filed federal or state personal income tax\nreturns for tax years 1997 through 2008. Under federal income tax law, single\nindividuals under age 65 were required to file an income tax return if their gross income\nmet or exceeded the following minimum (single head of household in parentheses) for\nthe respective tax year: $6,800 ($8,700) in 1997, $6,950 ($8,950) in 1998, $7,050\n($9,100) in 1999, $7,200 ($9,250) in 2000, $7,450 ($9,550) in 2001, $7,700 ($9,900) in\n2002, $7,800 ($10,050) in 2003, $7,950 ($10,250) in 2004, $8,200 ($10,500) in 2005,\n$8,450 ($10,850) in 2006, $8,750 ($11,250) in 2007, and $8,950 ($11,500) in 2008 (Ex.\n3). Based on her reported social security earnings, Applicant\u2019s gross income exceeded\nthe minimum required to file federal tax returns only for tax years 1998 and 2008. Even\nif she earned about $1,000 in income from her independent candle sales in 2007, her\ngross income for that year would have been around $8,341, less than the $8,750\nrequired for a single filer.\n\nBased on her social security earnings of $18,288 for tax year 1998, the state tax rate was $225 plus\n6\n4.5% of the excess over $7,500 ($360 plus 4.5% of the excess over $7,500). Applicant would have been\nentitled to a personal exemption of $12,000 if single or of $19,000 if head of household for 1998. Furthermore,\nthe state provided for a credit on adjusted gross income in determining the amount of tax liability. For a single\nperson with an adjusted gross income of  more than $18,000 but less than $18,500, the credit was 40%.\nBased on her social security earnings of $24,250 for tax year 2008, the state tax rate was $300 plus 5% of\nthe excess over $10,000 for single filers ($480 plus 5% of the excess over $16,000 if head of household), the\npersonal exemption was $13,000, and the tax credit was 15%. See [state abbreviation omitted] Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7\n12-700, 12-702, 12-703.\n8\nConcerning her failure to file state income tax returns for tax years 1997 through\n2008, I cannot assume that the state filing requirements were the same or similar to the\nfederal requirements for any of the tax years at issue. Pertinent state law is appropriate\nfor judicial notice, and review of the applicable state\u2019s tax laws confirms that the state\nimposes a tax on income, for single persons at 3% or 4.5% for 1998 and 3% or 5% for\n2008 depending on income. While it is unclear whether Applicant owes any taxes,\ngiven the personal exemptions and state tax credits on adjusted gross income,  the\n6\nstate imposes a tax on income for \u201cany person who files a return under the federal\nincome tax for such taxable year.\u201d Since Applicant met the income threshold requiring\nher to file federal returns for tax years 1998 and 2008, she was likely required to file\nstate income tax returns for those two tax years. AG \u00b6 19(g), \u201cfailure to file annual\nFederal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of the\nsame,\u201d applies because of her failure to timely file individual federal and state income\ntax returns for tax years 1998 and 2008.\nAs of mid-September 2009, Applicant had not filed her delinquent returns,\ndespite knowing as of June 2008, if not before when she completed her e-QIP, that her\nunresolved tax matters were of concern to the Department of Defense. She did not seek\nto justify the delay (\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s really a very good reason for it.\u201d Tr. 60), but\ncandor is not enough to mitigate the security concerns raised by recent non-compliance.\nAG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or it occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d cannot reasonably\napply in mitigation.\nApplicant\u2019s minimal income, and the theft in late 1996 of the laptop, which held\nher financial records, caused her to not file income tax returns for 1997. The theft of her\nlaptop is a circumstance that would fall within AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in\nthe family problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d But the loss of financial\ndata pertinent to 1996 and previous years cannot reasonably excuse her failure to\nreport and pay taxes on her income for tax year 1998. Nor were Applicant\u2019s family\nresponsibilities so extensive to excuse her failure to comply with her tax obligation. Her\nsister attended a day program five days per week at that time, and she was capable of\nfunctioning within her community. Caregiver responsibilities also cannot justify her\nfailure to file her 2008 returns by the August 31, 2009, extended deadline. Applicant\u2019s\nsister had been placed in a residential setting in February 2008, and Applicant\u2019s father,\n\n9\nalthough elderly, did not require her continuous attention. Office and residential moves\nin 2008 were not factors outside of her control that could extenuate her failure to file her\n2008 returns on time. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not mitigate her failure to file her required\nreturns.\nApplicant intends to satisfy her filing obligations by October 15, 2009, but there is\nlittle assurance that she will meet her self-imposed deadline. Applicant told a\ngovernment investigator in June 2008 that she was in the process of gathering the\ninformation required to file the appropriate tax returns within the next three to six\nmonths. As of May 28, 2009, she was still in the process pulling together her financial\nrecords. On the advice of an IRS case worker, she filed with the IRS in June 2009 a\nrequest for wage and compensation information and a literal transaction of accounts for\n2001 through 2008. She did not ask for information covering 1998, and the income and\nexpense data for her independent consulting in 2008 would not be known to the IRS. So\neven if the information requested is forthcoming from the IRS, she would not have all\nthe documentation needed to file her delinquent returns. It would be premature to apply\nAG \u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to\nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the\nissue,\u201d applies to the extent that Applicant has provided income information sufficient to\nraise substantial doubt about whether she was required to file federal or state income\ntax returns for several tax years. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not mitigate her failure to file for 1998\nand 2008, which are not subject to reasonable dispute.\nApplicant has not attributed her failure to file her income tax returns to an inability\nto afford taxes. She could be entitled to refunds for the tax years for which she has not\nfiled returns. But her financial situation has been tenuous for some time. She depleted\nall but $2,000 of a $25,000 individual retirement account to pay expenses when she had\nlittle income. In her favor, she began working for her current employer part-time in 2006\nto supplement her earnings, and she began full-time employment in April 2008. Yet, as\nof September 2009, she had only $12 in savings and $300 in checking deposits. She\nowed $5,000 on a credit card account, which she was repaying at $300 per month.\nShould she eventually file her delinquent returns, it is unclear whether she will be able to\nafford back taxes or penalties, if any, assessed for late filing. Financial considerations\nare not fully mitigated.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the conduct\nand all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a):\n\n10\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant has carried out her duties at work with an attention to detail described\nas \u201cimpeccable.\u201d But she has not displayed similar thoroughness or dedication in\nhandling her personal tax matters. Applicant has not filed a federal or state income tax\nreturn since 1998, when the returns for tax year 1997 would have been due. For several\nof the ensuing years, her wage earnings did not meet the minimum required for her to\nfile. However, for 1998 and 2008, when she met the income threshold, Applicant made\nno effort to comply with her obligation to file timely returns. Starting in 2006, she began\nto supplement her income through an independent consulting business, and she did not\nreport that income to tax authorities. Applicant knew for over a year that the government\nwas concerned about her failure to file. Despite needing her income from her defense\ncontractor employment, she did not make filing her returns a priority. Applicant\u2019s failure\nto comply with her tax obligations raises substantial concerns about her overall\njudgment and reliability that are not fully mitigated.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the\namended SOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nElizabeth M. Matchinski\nAdministrative Judge\n",

(Transcript at 46-48; Applicant\u2019s Exhibits C, and E at\n7.) These allegations are found for the Applicant.\n1.ww.  The Applicant admits owing this debt in the amount of $213.

(Transcript at 49; Government Exhibit 10 at 4.) The\nApplicant\u2019s testimony was credible on this point. This allegation is found for the\nApplicant.\n1.bbb.  The Applicant has consistently denied that he owes $757 for a small\nclaims court judgment. He submitted documentation that his bank account was\ngarnished to pay off this amount. (Transcript at 50; Government Exhibit 10 at 2;\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit A.) This allegation is found for the Applicant.\n1.ccc.  The Applicant has consistently denied that he owes $1,189 for a court\njudgment. He submitted documentation that his wages were garnished to pay off this\namount. (Transcript at 50; Government Exhibit 10 at 3; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.) This\nallegation is found for the Applicant.\n1.ddd. The Applicant admits owing this judgment in the amount of $1,840.\n(Transcript at 50; Government Exhibit 10 at 1.) He submits that he is making\narrangements with the court to pay this debt off. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E at 8.)\n\n7\nThe Applicant had stated that he would begin paying off his past due debts in\n2008. (Government Exhibits 3 and 4.) Instead, the Applicant testified that after his wife\nbecame pregnant they used money, intended to pay down his debt, on items for the\nchild. (Transcript at 55.) \nThe Applicant was also determined to have a service-connected disability.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D at 13.) He received a lump sum payment, which he and his wife\nused to buy furniture, pay down their car, and buy automobile insurance. None was\nused to pay down his past due indebtedness. (Transcript at 60-64.)\nFinally, the Applicant stated that he had been paying various debts that were not\nlisted in the SOR. He was given an opportunity to submit evidence supporting this\nstatement. No such evidence was submitted. (Transcript at 64-72.)\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has made false statements to the Department of Defense during\nthe clearance screening process.\nThe Applicant filled out a Government questionnaire in February 2008 in which\nhe stated that he was not currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts.  He also\nstated that, within the past seven years, he had not been over 180 days delinquent on\nany debts.  (Government Exhibit 1 at questions 28(a) and 28(b).)  These answers were\nnot true, as the Applicant owed over 50 creditors approximately $72,000.\nThe Applicant testified on this issue.  (Transcript at 51-54.)  He stated that he\nattempted to complete the electronic questionnaire, but it would not validate because he\ndid not have all the information the program wanted. Pursuant to his security officer\u2019s\ninstructions, he stated that he had put the phrase \u201cSee Credit Report\u201d down on the form\nunder these questions. He did not know that the final form he submitted did not have the\nphrase. He stated, \u201cI\u2019m not trying to hide anything. I know I have debt. I know I have to\npay it off.\u201d (Transcript at 52.) His testimony was credible and believable on this issue.\nUnder the particular facts of this case, I find that while his answers were false, he did\nnot intend to mislead the Government in any way.  \nMitigation\nThe Applicant submitted letters from both his supervisor and the facility security\nofficer. The Applicant\u2019s supervisor describes him as \u201ca most ethical individual and\ndisplays the highest marks in integrity.\u201d (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E at 2.) The facility security\nofficer states about the Applicant, \u201cHe is an excellent employee and there are no\nconcerns with any aspect of his professional or personal life.\u201d (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E at\n3.)\n\n8\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are to be used as appropriate in evaluating an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.  In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his own common sense,\nas well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the world, in\nmaking a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny\ndetermination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\n\n9\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between an applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance. If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or\nmitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case. The\napplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial\nevidence that the Applicant had financial difficulties (Guideline F), and that the Applicant\nmade false statements in the clearance screening process (Guideline E.) The Applicant,\non the other hand, has mitigated Guideline E, but not successfully mitigated the\nGovernment's Guideline F case, except in part. \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:     \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise\nsecurity concerns.  The Applicant failed to pay a substantial number of debts for a\nperiod of years.  These debts total $72,493. The evidence is sufficient to raise these\npotentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties.  Mitigating Condition \u00b6 20(a) states that the\ndisqualifying conditions may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago,\nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness or good\njudgment.  The Applicant has a years-long history of not paying his obligations. Based\n\n10\non his history, I find that the behavior is likely to recur and does cast doubt on his\ncurrent reliability. This mitigating condition does not apply to this case.\nUnder AG \u00b6 20(b), the disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where the\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment . . . unexpected medical emergency), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances.  The Applicant has had several\nmedical events happen over the last several years. However, it cannot be said that he\nbehaved responsibly under the circumstances. The evidence shows that the Applicant\nmakes promises to pay, but then uses the money set aside for his past due debts to pay\nfor other items. He has an extensive plan for paying his substantial past due\nindebtedness, as discussed above, but virtually no track record of carrying out such a\nplan. A statement of intent to pay debts sometime in the future, no matter how sincere,\nis not a substitute for concrete actions. This mitigating condition does not apply to this\ncase.\nEvidence that the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts is also mitigating under \u00b6 20(d).  No evidence was submitted\nthat the Applicant has voluntarily paid a single debt set forth in the SOR.  As stated\nabove, promises are insufficiently mitigating in this case. Where debts have been paid,\nit has been pursuant to court order. Subparagraphs 1.uu. and 1.xx. are found for the\nApplicant because his back child support is being paid by court order. Subparagraphs\n1.aaa., 1.bbb., and 1.ccc are found for the Applicant because these judgments have\nbeen satisfied. This mitigating condition minimally applies to this case.\nFinally, \u00b6 20(e) states that it may be mitigating where the individual has a\nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the\nproblem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or\nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.  As set forth above, the Applicant has\nlegitimate disputes with some of his creditors. Where there is such a dispute, I have\nfound for the Applicant with regard to subparagraphs 1.z., 1.nn., 1.rr., and 1.yy. This\nmitigating condition also minimally applies to this case. \nI have found for the Applicant with regards to $32,471 worth of debt. Even\nallowing the Applicant credit for his unpaid medical bills, they only total $11,335.\nAccordingly, under a best-case scenario, the Applicant still owes $28,687 to many\nlegitimate creditors and there is no reasonable expectation of his paying any of it in the\nforseeable future. When the Applicant\u2019s entire debt history is viewed, he has not\nmitigated the security concerns about his financial situation. Paragraph 1 is found\nagainst the Applicant.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nThe Applicant did provide false information on his questionnaire concerning the\nextent of his debt situation.  However, the Applicant\u2019s explanation for the failure to\ndiscuss his extensive indebtedness is reasonable and believable. As stated above,\n\n11\nwhile I find that his answers were false, I also find that there was no intent to deceive\nthe Government. Guideline E is found for the Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination\nof whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person\nconcept. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The Applicant is under financial\nstrain, and has been so for several years. His debt situation is not under control. Under\nAG \u00b6 2(a)(3), the Applicant\u2019s conduct is recent.  Based on the state of the record, I find\nthat there have not been permanent behavioral changes which would resolve the\nsecurity concerns under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6). Accordingly, at the present time, I find that there\nis the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b6 2(a)(8)); and that\nthere is a high likelihood of recurrence (AG \u00b6 2(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude the\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial situation at\nthis time. As stated above, Paragraph 2 is found for the Applicant.\nOn balance, I conclude that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a denial of his request for a security clearance.\n\n12\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.I:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\n \nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nNo Allegation\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.t:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.u:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.v:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.w:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.x:\n \nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.y:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.z:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.aa:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.bb:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.cc:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.dd:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.ee:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.ff:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.gg:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.hh:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.ii:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.jj:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.kk:\n \nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.ll:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.mm:\nAgainst the Applicant\n\n13\nSubparagraph 1.nn:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.oo:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.pp:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.qq:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.rr:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.ss:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.tt:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.uu:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.vv:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.ww:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.xx:\n \nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.yy:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.zz:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.aaa:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.bbb:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.ccc:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.ddd:\nAgainst the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nFor the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nAlan V. Edmunds, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On February 27, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\n\n2\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested that his case be decided on the written record.  On June 23, 2009, after the close of the\nrecord, Administrative Judge Joan Caton Anthony denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable\ndecision.\nSome of Applicant\u2019s assertions on appeal rely on matters not contained in the record below.\nAs such, the assertions are based on new evidence.  The Board cannot consider new evidence on\nappeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nThe Judge found that Applicant had a history of financial difficulties that at least spanned the\nperiod from 2001 to 2008.  The Judge concluded that several of the delinquencies remained unpaid\nor unresolved at the time of the closing of the record and that they occurred under circumstances that\nwere likely to recur.  The Judge found that most of Applicant\u2019s attempts to pay, settle, or dispute his\ndebts occurred after he received the SOR in February 2009.  She found that Applicant has not sought\nconsumer credit counseling that could provide him with strategies for effectively managing his\nfinances and resolving future delinquent debts.  The Judge also found that Applicant resolved three\nlongstanding debts totaling approximately $485, but Applicant instructed a financial management\nfirm he contacted in September 2008 to dispute three debts totaling approximately $20,533 and has\nsince provided no specific information as to the grounds upon which the debts were disputed.  She\nconcluded that it is unclear at this time how these currently unresolved debts might impact\nApplicant\u2019s future financial stability.  The Judge also concluded that Applicant provided conflicting\ninformation regarding resolution of his two federal tax liens, and he did not provide documentation\nto corroborate his assertion that the liens were not his responsibility.  The Judge ultimately concluded\nthat, while Applicant may have good intentions to pay, settle, or dispute several debts alleged in the\nSOR, he failed to show a track record of financial responsibility, and it is unclear how he will handle\nhis financial responsibilities in the future.  \n  \nOn appeal, Applicant argues that the Judge did not consider evidence submitted in response\nto the FORM, specifically two documents from a credit management organization indicating that\nApplicant was working to resolve specific accounts.  Applicant also alleges that the Judge did not\nproperly analyze evidence presented by Applicant that he was not responsible for two tax liens.\nApplicant finally asserts that the Judge erred when she failed to apply various mitigating conditions\nin Applicant\u2019s favor.  These assertions do not establish error on the part of the Judge.\nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge has considered all the record evidence unless\nhe or she specifically states otherwise.  That presumption has not been overcome here.  The items\nof evidence Applicant claims were excluded from the Judge\u2019s analysis are specifically referenced\nby the Judge in her decision.  The Judge discusses the conflict surrounding the status of Applicant\u2019s\noutstanding tax liens and indicates that the lack of corroboration for his assertion that the liens were\n\n3\nnot his responsibility was a factor in her resolution of the issue against Applicant.  This analysis is\nsustainable.    \nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd.\nOct. 12, 2007).  \nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  She specifically gave Applicant credit for the debts that he had resolved and\nalso discussed his interactions with a credit management company.  She also noted, however, that\nApplicant\u2019s efforts to resolve his delinquent debt were recent and inconclusive.  The Judge\nconcluded that the evidence in mitigation was of insufficient strength to overcome the government\u2019s\nsecurity concerns.  This conclusion is reasonably supported by the record. \nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for\nher decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)\n(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe general\nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the\nnational security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

His eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant completed and certified an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) on May 6, 2008. On February 27, 2009, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing the security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on March 26, 2009 and requested a decision on \nthe record in lieu of a hearing.  The Government compiled its File of Relevant Material \nJune 23, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n(FORM) on April 30, 2009. The FORM contained documents identified as Items 1 \nthrough 8.

(Item 1; Item 4.) \n \n \nApplicant is 48 years old and employed as a senior training instructor by a \ngovernment contractor. In August 1978, he enlisted in the U.S. military. He served until \nDecember 1983, and was honorably discharged. He held a security clearance when \nemployed as a government contractor from 1984 to 1993. (Item 5; Response to FORM \nat 1.) \n \n \nApplicant married for the first time in 1983. He was divorced in 1994, and he \nmarried his current wife in 1994.  Applicant is the father of an adult son, who was born \nin 1984. (Item 5.)  \n \n \nFrom 1995 to 2003, Applicant was employed by a company which laid him off \nduring the financial downturn that resulted from the terrorist attacks of September 11, \n2001. As a result, he was unemployed for four months in 2003. He moved to another \nstate to accept a job in October 2003, where he worked for approximately nine months. \nHe thought his moving expenses would be paid by the company, but they were not, and \nthis caused him some financial hardship. (Item 4; Item 5.)  \n \n \nIn 2004, he moved again to another state to do contract work for a company for \none year. In 2005, he returned to his home area and took a job for nine months. In \n2006, he was rehired by the company which laid him off in 2003. He worked for this \ncompany for approximately two years. In March 2008, he accepted a position with his \npresent employer.  (Item 4; Item 5.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports reflect a history of financial delinquency. In 1994 and \n1995, two federal tax liens were levied against him. These debts were alleged at SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b. and 1.c. of the SOR. In his Answer to the SOR, dated March 9, 2009, Applicant \ndenied responsibility for these debts and stated that he was disputing them. A \ncommunication from a firm he hired to help him identify and resolve his financial \ndelinquencies, dated October 20, 2008, states, under a heading identified as \u201cFederal \nTax Lien,\u201d that \u201c[c]lient was paying account, is now disputing the accuracy of the \n\n \n3 \n \n \nreported information.\u201d In correspondence with DOHA, dated October 8, 2008, he \nreported he had been in contact with the taxing authority and he stated he would begin \nmaking payments on the two liens, which he identified as totaling $414.80 and $375.14, \nin the \u201cnext week.\u201d He failed to provide factual documentation to corroborate the nature \nof his dispute or his payment of these debts. (Item 4; Item 6; Item 8.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports also show, and the SOR alleges, that a judgment for \napproximately $833 was entered against him in 2001, and the debt had not been paid \nas of October 20, 2008. (SOR \u00b6 1.d.)  Applicant admitted the debt in his Answer to the \nSOR; he reported that he had tried, without success, to contact the responsible creditor. \nIn a document sent to Applicant and dated May 14, 2009, a national credit bureau \nreported that the judgment had been disputed and was no longer listed on his credit \nreport.  Applicant filed this document in response to the FORM.  (Item 1; Item 4; Item 8; \nResponse to FORM at 3.)   \n    \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit report of May 10, 2008 showed that he owed a debt of $191 to \na communications provider, and the debt had been delinquent since 2002. Documents \nprovided by Applicant indicated he had entered into a payment plan to resolve the debt, \nbut it remained unpaid as of October 20, 2008. This debt was alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.e.  In \nhis Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the debt. He provided documentation from \nthe creditor corroborating his payment of the debt on March 25, 2009. (Item 1; Item 4; \nItem 8; Response to FORM at 3.) \n \n \nApplicant admitted he owed an additional delinquent debt of $183 to a \ncommunications provider, and, as of January 30, 2009, the debt had not been paid. This \ndebt was alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.a. In his answer to the SOR, and in his response to the \nFORM, Applicant provided documentation to corroborate his statement that the debt \nhad been satisfied on March 25, 2009.  (Item 1; Item 4; Response to FORM at 3.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.h. that Applicant owed a delinquent debt of $111 to a \nbank on an overdrawn checking account. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted \nthe debt and provided documentation from the bank, dated March 10, 2009, to \ncorroborate his statement that the debt had been satisfied in full.  (Item 1; Item 4) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged, and Applicant admitted, that he was responsible to two \nautomotive finance companies for unpaid accounts, in collection status, of $4,152 and \n$15,220. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f. and 1.g.)  On September 29, 2008, Applicant engaged a credit \nmanagement firm to assist him in contacting his creditors and identifying his debts. He \ninstructed the credit management firm to dispute the accounts identified at SOR \u00b6 1.f. \nand 1.g. because he believed the amounts sought by the creditors were in excess of \nwhat he actually owed. Both of these accounts had been in collection status since 2004. \nApplicant failed to provide documentation to substantiate his disputes.  (Item 1; Item 4; \nItem 8.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.i. that Applicant owed a delinquent debt of $1,161 to a \ncommunications creditor. The debt was listed on Applicant\u2019s credit report of May 10, \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \n2008 as a collection account, first reported in January 2006. In his answer to the SOR, \nApplicant denied the debt. He stated that he had instructed the credit management firm \nto dispute the debt. He did not provide documentation to substantiate the dispute. (Item \n1; Item 4; Response to FORM at 4, 5.) \n \n \nApplicant completed and certified an e-QIP on May 6, 2008. In response to \nquestions posed under Section 27: Your Financial Record, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d \nto questions which asked whether any liens had been placed against him in the past \nseven years, whether any judgments had been placed against him in the last seven \nyears, whether, in the last seven years, he had been over 180 days delinquent on any \ndebts, and whether he was currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt.1 \n \n \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant provided a personal financial \nstatement dated October 10, 2008. He reported that he and his wife had a net monthly \nincome of $4,993 and total monthly expenses of $3,152. They paid $873 each month to \ntwo automotive creditors, for vehicles they are purchasing on credit. Their net remainder \neach month is $968. (Item 4.) \n \n \nThe record does not reflect that Applicant has sought or received credit \ncounseling.  \n    \n \n \n \n \n               Policies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n1 The SOR made no allegations of falsification under Guideline E, Personal Conduct. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Over a period of at least eight years, Applicant accumulated \nsubstantial delinquent debt and did not pay his creditors. This evidence is sufficient to \nraise these potentially disqualifying conditions. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions \ncould apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. \nUnresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if it happened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n(AG \u00b6 20(a)).  Unresolved financial delinquency might also be mitigated if the conditions \nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control, such as \nloss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, \ndivorce, or separation, and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \n(AG \u00b6 20(b)). Still other mitigating circumstances that might be applicable include \nevidence the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control (AG \u00b6 \n20(c)) or the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. (AG \u00b6 20 (d)).  Additionally, financial delinquencies of security \nconcern might be mitigated if the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of dispute or provides evidence of actions to \nresolve the issue. (AG \u00b6 20(e)).  \n \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquencies that dates to at least the period \nfrom 2001 to 2008. Moreover, several of the delinquencies remain unpaid or unresolved \nand occurred under circumstances that are likely to recur. Most of his attempts to pay, \nsettle, or dispute his debts occurred after he received the SOR in February 2009. He \nhas not sought consumer credit counseling that could provide him with strategies for \neffectively managing his finances and resolving future delinquent debts.  \n \nApplicant appears to have resources sufficient to pay or settle his delinquent \ndebts, and he has failed to do so. While he stated that he suffered financial hardship \nwhen his moving expenses were not paid by his employer when he moved to another \nstate to take a job in 2003, he did not specify how this deficit specifically impacted his \nfinancial situation and impacted his budgeting and expenditures. The record does not \nreflect that the circumstances that gave rise to his delinquencies were beyond his \ncontrol. Even if he suffered a financial setback in 2004, he has been steadily employed \nin his home region since 2006, suggesting continuity and sufficient stability to manage \nand meet economic challenges.  \n \nApplicant has provided documentation to corroborate his statements that he paid \nthree of the debts alleged in the SOR. Together, these debts totaled approximately \n$485. Applicant should be commended for resolving these long-standing debts. \nHowever, he has instructed the financial management firm he contacted in September \n2008 to dispute three debts that total approximately $20,533, and since he provided no \nspecific information on the grounds upon which these debts were disputed, it is unclear \nat this time how these currently unresolved debts may impact his future financial \nstability.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant provided conflicting information regarding resolution of his two federal \ntax liens. In response to DOHA interrogatories, he stated his intent to begin paying the \nliens \u201cnext week.\u201d Later, in his Answer to the SOR, he stated he was disputing the liens, \nasserting that he was not responsible for paying them. He did not provide \ndocumentation to corroborate his conclusion that the liens were not his responsibility. In \ndetermining an individual's security worthiness, the Government cannot rely on the \npossibility that an applicant might resolve his or her outstanding debts at some future \ndate. ISCR Case No. 98-0614 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 1999).  I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(a), 20(c), and 20(e) do not apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case and that AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(b) and 20(d) apply in part in mitigation. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult.  He has \nbeen steadily employed in his home region since 2006 and reports a net remainder \neach month of approximately $968. He allowed many of his debts to remain delinquent \nfor a protracted time. His failure to satisfy his creditors over a period of several years \nraises security concerns about his judgment and reliability. \n \nApplicant\u2019s actions to contact his creditors and to begin to resolve his debts are \nrecent. The three debts he resolved were paid in March 2009. While Applicant may \nhave good intentions to turn over a new leaf and pay, settle, or dispute several debts \nalleged on the SOR, he fails to show a track record of financial responsibility over time. \nIt is unclear how he will handle his financial responsibilities in the future. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \n\n \n8 \n \n \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his \nfinancial delinquencies.  Applicant can reapply for a security clearance one year after \nthe date that this decision becomes final. If he wishes, he can produce new evidence \nthat addresses the Government\u2019s current security concerns.    \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n           For Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b. and 1.c.: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d. and 1.e.: \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f. and 1.g.: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n    Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nAlan V. Edmunds, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On February 27, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested that his case be decided on the written record.  On June 23, 2009, after the close of the\nrecord, Administrative Judge Joan Caton Anthony denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable\ndecision.\n\n2\nSome of Applicant\u2019s assertions on appeal rely on matters not contained in the record below.\nAs such, the assertions are based on new evidence.  The Board cannot consider new evidence on\nappeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nThe Judge found that Applicant had a history of financial difficulties that at least spanned the\nperiod from 2001 to 2008.  The Judge concluded that several of the delinquencies remained unpaid\nor unresolved at the time of the closing of the record and that they occurred under circumstances that\nwere likely to recur.  The Judge found that most of Applicant\u2019s attempts to pay, settle, or dispute his\ndebts occurred after he received the SOR in February 2009.  She found that Applicant has not sought\nconsumer credit counseling that could provide him with strategies for effectively managing his\nfinances and resolving future delinquent debts.  The Judge also found that Applicant resolved three\nlongstanding debts totaling approximately $485, but Applicant instructed a financial management\nfirm he contacted in September 2008 to dispute three debts totaling approximately $20,533 and has\nsince provided no specific information as to the grounds upon which the debts were disputed.  She\nconcluded that it is unclear at this time how these currently unresolved debts might impact\nApplicant\u2019s future financial stability.  The Judge also concluded that Applicant provided conflicting\ninformation regarding resolution of his two federal tax liens, and he did not provide documentation\nto corroborate his assertion that the liens were not his responsibility.  The Judge ultimately concluded\nthat, while Applicant may have good intentions to pay, settle, or dispute several debts alleged in the\nSOR, he failed to show a track record of financial responsibility, and it is unclear how he will handle\nhis financial responsibilities in the future.  \n  \nOn appeal, Applicant argues that the Judge did not consider evidence submitted in response\nto the FORM, specifically two documents from a credit management organization indicating that\nApplicant was working to resolve specific accounts.  Applicant also alleges that the Judge did not\nproperly analyze evidence presented by Applicant that he was not responsible for two tax liens.\nApplicant finally asserts that the Judge erred when she failed to apply various mitigating conditions\nin Applicant\u2019s favor.  These assertions do not establish error on the part of the Judge.\nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge has considered all the record evidence unless\nhe or she specifically states otherwise.  That presumption has not been overcome here.  The items\nof evidence Applicant claims were excluded from the Judge\u2019s analysis are specifically referenced\nby the Judge in her decision.  The Judge discusses the conflict surrounding the status of Applicant\u2019s\noutstanding tax liens and indicates that the lack of corroboration for his assertion that the liens were\nnot his responsibility was a factor in her resolution of the issue against Applicant.  This analysis is\nsustainable.    \nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\n\n3\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd.\nOct. 12, 2007).  \nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  She specifically gave Applicant credit for the debts that he had resolved and\nalso discussed his interactions with a credit management company.  She also noted, however, that\nApplicant\u2019s efforts to resolve his delinquent debt were recent and inconclusive.  The Judge\nconcluded that the evidence in mitigation was of insufficient strength to overcome the government\u2019s\nsecurity concerns.  This conclusion is reasonably supported by the record. \nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for\nher decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs.

Applicant appealed pursuant to\nthe Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision was arbitrary,\ncapricious or contrary to law.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable\ndecision. \nThe Judge found, inter alia, that in March 2006, Applicant used marijuana as an off-duty\nfederal law enforcement officer who held a security clearance.  She found that, at the time of the\nincident, Applicant was assigned as an armed special agent on the protection detail of a high-ranking\nfederal official and had held a security clearance for about four years.  The Judge also found that\nprior to his position as a federal law enforcement officer, Applicant had worked as a special\ninvestigator who conducted background investigations for security clearance applicants.  As such,\nhe was thoroughly familiar with the security concerns relating to illegal drug use because he was\nrequired to inquire about and investigate illegal drug use by individuals who sought access to\nclassified information.  The Judge also found that, at the time of the incident, Applicant took evasive\naction to hide the marijuana from the police and to deter their investigation.  The Judge also found\nthat in 2005, Applicant incurred over $20,000 in personal charges on a government cell phone while\nworking overseas.  \nThe Judge concluded that although Applicant\u2019s 2006 drug use was not recent and occurred\nonly once, Applicant\u2019s status as a security clearance holder and a special agent who was thoroughly\nfamiliar with government security concerns related to illegal drug use and his status as a special\nagent authorized to carry a firearm and charged with protecting a high government official, raised\nserious questions about his judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability.  She also concluded that\ndespite Applicant\u2019s stated remorse and the negative impact the 2006 incident had on his career,\ninsufficient time had passed to demonstrate a positive and permanent change in behavior.  The Judge\nalso concluded that when Applicant\u2019s marijuana use and failure to follow his employer\u2019s instructions\nabout the use of his government cell phone is viewed from a whole person perspective,  unmitigated\nquestions remain about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  In doing so, the Judge asserted\nthat because of his status as a federal law enforcement officer with a clearance who took evasive\naction on the night of the marijuana incident in an attempt to protect himself, Applicant\u2019s marijuana\nuse was not simply an isolated use of an illegal drug.  \nApplicant argues that his single instance of marijuana use sufficiently invoked pertinent\nconsiderations under Guideline H so as to mitigate any security concerns raised by a single\naberrational event.  He argues that his gross deviation from his customary behavior is not indicative\n\n3\nof his judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, nor is it likely to recur.  Applicant\u2019s arguments in this\nregard do not establish error on the part of the Judge.\n             Applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue\nfor a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).  In this case, the Judge noted\nApplicant\u2019s favorable characteristics, professional accomplishments and responsible behavior since\nthe 2006 drug incident, but indicated why these factors were insufficient to overcome the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns given his status as a federal law enforcement officer and a former\nbackground investigator and his actions in attempting to cover up his illegal activity.  The Judge\u2019s\nconclusions in this regard are sustainable on this record.\nApplicant also argues that the Judge\u2019s decision is erroneous in part because it analyzes his\ndrug use under two different guidelines and reaches opposite conclusions.  It is permitted to do so.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-09251 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2009).  In this case, however, the Judge\u2019s\nreasoning is at least somewhat problematic in that she used contradictory language.  In concluding\nfor Applicant under Guideline J the Judge applied \u00b632(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed since the\ncriminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d\nWhereas in concluding against Applicant under Guideline H for the same conduct the Judge wrote,\n\u201cThis conduct casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.\u201d  Similarly, she\napplied Guideline J, \u00b6 32 (d), \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or\nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community involvement;\u201d in Applicant\u2019s\nfavor, but wrote under Guideline H, \u201cEven though he expressed remorse for his behavior and the\nnegative impact it had on his career, he also suggested that his arrest was unwarranted.  I conclude\nthat insufficient time has passed to demonstrate a positive and permanent change in behavior.\u201d\nApplicant is correct that there appears to be a contradiction and such contradiction is error.\nHowever, the Board concludes that the error is harmless, as the Judge\u2019s adverse conclusions\nregarding Applicant\u2019s drug use under Guideline H are sustainable and provide an adequate basis for\nher ultimate adverse security clearance decision.\nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for\nher decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)\n(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe general\nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the\nnational security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  Therefore, the\nJudge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable security clearance decision is sustainable.\n\n4\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Murphy, Esquire, Department  Counsel \nFor Applicant: Charles Tucker, Jr., Esquire \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nANTHONY, Joan Caton, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I \nconclude that Applicant mitigated the Government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline \nJ, Criminal Conduct, and Guideline F, Financial Considerations. However, he failed to \nmitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement, and \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct.  His eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant executed a security clearance application (SF-86) on October 3, 2001. \nOn January 2, 2008, he completed and signed a Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions \n(Questionnaire). On April 23, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline H, Drug Involvement, Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, Guideline E, \nPersonal Conduct, and Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \nSeptember 9, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \n \nOn May 18, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 29, \n2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on July 10, 2009, and I convened a hearing on \nAugust 10, 2009, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The Government called no \nwitnesses and introduced four exhibits, which were marked Ex. 1 through 4 and \nadmitted to the record without objection.  Applicant testified on his own behalf, called \nfour witnesses, and introduced eight exhibits, which were marked Exs. A through H. \nApplicant\u2019s exhibits were admitted to the record without objection.  \n \n \nTo conform the allegation at SOR \u00b6 3(c) with facts elicited at the hearing, \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the allegation to read: \u201cIn or about April 2005, \nyou misused a cellular phone issued by . . . [your federal] employer, by incurring over \n$20,000 in personal phone charges.1 As of September 16, 2008, the balance was \napproximately $19,245.24.\u201d The amendment to the SOR was approved without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on August 14, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains three allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG H, Drug \nInvolvement (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.c.); two allegations of disqualifying conduct under \nAG J, Criminal Conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. and 2.b.); three allegations of disqualifying \nconduct under AG E, Personal Conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a. through 3.c.); and one allegation \nof disqualifying conduct under AG F, Financial Considerations (SOR \u00b6 4.a.). In his \nAnswer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the three allegations under AG H; he denied the \ntwo allegations under AG J; he admitted the three allegations under AG E; and he \nadmitted the one allegation under AG F. He also provided additional information. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions are admitted herein as findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is 31 years old, never married, and employed as a senior consultant by \na government contractor. In 2001, he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree, and in 2002, he \nacquired a position as a contract special investigator. In that job, he was responsible for \ninvestigating the backgrounds of individuals who applied for security clearances. In \norder to carry out these duties, he was granted a security clearance. He was also \nsubject to random drug tests. (Ex. 2; Tr. 134-136.)  \n \n \nApplicant left his job as a special investigator in 2003 and accepted federal \nemployment as a special agent. His duties required that he hold a security clearance. \nFor two years, he was assigned to a field office. In April 2005, he was assigned to a \nsecurity detail in a foreign country for approximately 45 days. While on this assignment, \nApplicant was told he could use his government cell phone to make short personal calls, \nand he was informed that incoming calls were free. During the 45 days he was assigned \nin the foreign country, Applicant accrued between $25,000 and $30,000 in charges on \n \n1 The amendment deleted \u201cApril 2006\u201d and substituted instead \u201cApril 2005.\u201d In this narrative, I have \ndeleted the name of  the federal agency involved  to protect Applicant\u2019s privacy. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nhis government cell phone. His agency demanded repayment, and Applicant complied. \nHe made some payments to the agency, which were returned to him. The agency \nreported that Applicant had paid $2,784 on the debt as of August 3, 2009. The current \nbalance on the account is $18,892. Applicant has been making regular payments on the \ndebt, and the agency does not consider the debt to be delinquent. To date, he believes \nhe has had paid about $5,000 to the agency to satisfy the debt.  (Answer to SOR; Ex. 2; \nEx. 3 at 8-9; Ex. F; Tr. 115-123, 141,145, 155.) \n \n \nIn October 2005, as a special agent licensed to carry a firearm, Applicant was \nassigned to the security detail of a high government official. On a weekend in March \n2006, while off-duty, he and two friends traveled in Applicant\u2019s automobile to an Eastern \nU.S. city to celebrate his birthday. During the trip, Applicant used marijuana belonging to \none of his friends. The friend stored two or three small bags of marijuana in the console \nof Applicant\u2019s car.  (Ex. 2; Ex. 3; Tr. 146-147.) \n \n \nAs Applicant and his friends were returning from their trip, his car was pulled over \nby police. As the police were approaching his vehicle, Applicant opened the console to \nretrieve his badge, which he intended to show to the police officers. He saw the bags of \nmarijuana and put them in his pocket. (Ex. 3 at 8.) \n \n \nApplicant had his duty weapon with him in his automobile. When the officers saw \nthe weapon under a seat, they ordered Applicant and his two friends out of the car. \nThey ordered the three men to lie down on the ground between Applicant\u2019s car and the \npolice car. In his response to DOHA interrogatories, dated September 18, 2008, \nApplicant reported the following: \n \nWhile on the ground, I was still scared, so I threw the small bags of \nmarijuana under the police car. A few minutes went by and I saw an officer \npull out a very, very small amount of marijuana in a plastic bag from my \ncar. Then, we were all handcuffed and our rights were read out to us. One \nofficer picked me up, took my handcuffs off of me and handed me my \nbadge. An officer took me to the side and asked, \u201cWho[se] marijuana is it \nand who was smoking?\u201d [My companions] both have young children. I \ndidn\u2019t want their families [to] have to suffer and them [to] get into any \ntrouble that would put their families in a bad position. So, I told the police \nthe marijuana was mine and I was the only one smoking.  I was given a \nsobriety test and passed it.  \n \n    \nOne of the police vehicles pulled off and an officer spotted the small bags \nof marijuana I threw under the car. He asked me if they were mine and I \nnever responded. Then, I was taken to a police car and transported to the \npolice station. \n \n(Ex. 3 at 8; Tr. 103-104.) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant was arrested and charged with Possession of Marijuana Under 50 \nGrams. In the jurisdiction where Applicant was arrested, the drug possession charge  \nwas identified as \u201ca disorderly person offense,\u201d a misdemeanor. On the advice of his \nattorney, he pleaded guilty. He was fined about $833, sentenced to six months \nprobation with drug tests, and granted a conditional discharge, which was dismissed in \nabout January 2007. (Ex. 3 at 8; Ex. 4; Tr. 109-110, 147.) \n \n \n  \nThe officers who arrested Applicant informed his employer of the arrest.  When \nApplicant reported for duty on the first work day following his arrest, he was given a \ndrug test and tested positive for marijuana. Applicant\u2019s security clearance was revoked. \nHe was removed from his job as a special agent and reassigned to a non-sensitive \nposition. He resigned from the agency in October 2006. (Tr. 137-139, 145-148.) \n \n \nApplicant stated that his arrest in March 2006 was his first negative encounter \nwith law enforcement. He stated that his one and only use of marijuana occurred on the \nnight he was arrested. He denied using illegal drugs of any kind during his adolescent \nand college years. He asserted that he would never use illegal drugs in the future. He \nhas limited his social contacts with the individuals with whom he used marijuana in \nMarch 2006. Additionally, he asserted that his conduct during the search and arrest was \ncooperative and professional. He also suggested that the officers who stopped his car \non March 12, 2006, did so without a valid reason to arrest him. (Ex. 3 at 3; Tr. 105-109, \n111-113; 149-150.) \n \n \nFour character witnesses testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. Two witnesses were \nchildhood friends of the Applicant. All four witnesses spoke highly of Applicant and \nstated that he was not a drug user. (Tr. 35-81.) \n \n \nApplicant also provided letters of character reference from individuals who knew \nhim well. They too attested to his good character and reliability. His contractor team \nlead described him as an \u201cexcellent worker\u201d who \u201cis always courteous, helpful, and \ndedicated.\u201d Applicant\u2019s performance review for the period of March 2008 through \nDecember 2008 indicated an overall rating of 4, identified as \u201cexceeds expectations in \nall key areas.\u201d (Ex. A through Ex. E, Ex. G.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current annual salary is $73,542. His take home pay is about $3,600 \nper month. He resides in his parent\u2019s home.  Recently, Applicant became a father. He \npays the mother of his child $1,100 a month in child support. He pays his debts, and \nhas no delinquencies. (Ex. H; Tr.140,156-164.) \n \n                                                          Policies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \n\n \n5 \n \n \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Id. at \n527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                           \n Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness because it may impair judgment and \nbecause it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. AG \u00b6 24(a) defines drugs as \u201cmood and behavior altering \nsubstances.\u201d The definition of drugs includes \u201c(1) drugs, materials, and other chemical \ncompounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended \n(e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), \nand (2) inhalants and other similar substances.\u201d AG  \u00b6 24(b) defines drug abuse as \u201cthe \nillegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved \nmedical direction.\u201d \n \nThe record shows that Applicant admitted the illegal use and possession of \nmarijuana in March 2006. He tested positive for that illegal drug use, which occurred \nwhile he held a security clearance. This conduct casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment.  It also raises security concerns about his ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. I conclude that Applicant\u2019s illegal \ndrug use raises security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(b), 25(c), and 25(g).2  \n \nTwo Guideline H mitigating conditions might apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s \ncase.  If Applicant\u2019s drug use happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, then AG \u00b6 26(a) might be \napplicable in mitigation. If Applicant demonstrated an intent not to abuse any drugs in \nthe future by disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts, changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used, abstaining from drug use for an \nappropriate period, and signing a statement of intent with the automatic revocation of \nhis security clearance for any violation, then AG \u00b6 26(b) might be applicable.  \n \nThe record shows that Applicant\u2019s drug use is not recent and, according to his \ntestimony, occurred only once. Applicant stated he had not used marijuana since his \none-time use in March 2006, and he provided testimonial evidence corroborating his \nstatement about his abstinence from friends and others who knew him socially. \n \n2 AG \u00b6 25(a) reads: \u201cany drug abuse [as defined at AG \u00b6 24(b)].\u201d AG \u00b6 25(b) reads: \u201ctesting positive for \nillegal drug use.\u201d AG \u00b6 25(c) reads: \u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.\u201d AG\u00b6 25(g) reads: \u201cany illegal drug use \nafter being granted a security clearance.\u201d \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant stated he had changed his behavior and activities after his use of marijuana in \nMarch 2006 and his subsequent decision to abstain from illegal drugs. \n \nHowever, when Applicant used marijuana in 2006, he was a mature adult of 28 \nyears, and he had held a security clearance for approximately four years. During those \nfour years, he worked as a special investigator and as a special agent, occupations that \nrequire maturity, stability, and good judgment. In his work as a special investigator, he \nwas thoroughly familiar with the security concerns related to illegal drug use because \nhe was required to inquire about and investigate illegal drug use by individuals who \nsought access to classified information. As a special agent, he had been authorized to \ncarry a firearm and to protect a high government official. With this background, his \ndecision to use marijuana even once three years ago, while entrusted with a security \nclearance as a federal law enforcement officer, raises serious questions about his \njudgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. Even though he expressed remorse for his \nbehavior and the negative impact it had on his career, he also suggested that his arrest \nwas unwarranted. I conclude that insufficient time has passed to demonstrate a positive \nand permanent change in behavior. I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) do not fully \napply in mitigation to the security concerns raised by the facts in Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \n \n \nUnder the Criminal Conduct guideline \u201c[c]riminal activity creates doubt about a \nperson\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into \nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d  \nAG \u00b6 30. \n \n \n \nIn March 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with Possession of \nMarijuana Under 50 Grams, a misdemeanor crime identified as a disorderly person \noffense. He pled guilty and was fined about $833, sentenced to six months probation \nwith drug tests, and granted a conditional discharge. The charge was dismissed in \nJanuary 2007. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted this criminal conduct. \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s criminal behavior raises a security concern under AG \u00b6 31(c). AG \u00b6 \n31(c) reads: \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d \n \n \n \nTwo Criminal Conduct mitigating conditions might apply to the Applicant\u2019s case.  \nIf \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened \nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d AG \u00b6 32(a) might apply.  If \n\u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage of \ntime without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive involvement,\u201d then AG \u00b6 32(d) \nmight apply. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n \nApplicant averred that his use of illegal drugs occurred only once in his life: on \nthe night in March 2006 when he was arrested and charged with Possession of \nMarijuana Under 50 Grams. Since that time, he has had no other arrests or charges of \nillegal drug use or possession, and the record reflects no other criminal conduct of any \nkind by Applicant. He has demonstrated a good employment record, and his recent \nperformance evaluation shows he exceeds his employer\u2019s expectations in all key areas.  \nI conclude Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct has been mitigated by the passage of time and \nhe has demonstrated successful rehabilitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(c) apply in \nmitigation to the criminal conduct allegations in this case. \n \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern: \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nIn 2005, when Applicant was assigned overseas as a federal law enforcement \nofficer, his employer gave him permission to use his official cell phone to make brief \npersonal phone calls back to the United States. Within a period of about 45 days, \nApplicant\u2019s personal use of his official phone caused his employer to be charged \nbetween $25,000 and $30,000. This excessive use suggested that Applicant was \ninattentive to his responsibility to follow his employer\u2019s instructions and rules for making \nprudent use of government resources. \n \n \nIn March 2006, Applicant used marijuana while holding a security clearance as a \nfederal law enforcement officer. While Applicant asserted that his demeanor was \ncooperative and professional when he was stopped and searched by police, his own \naccount in his response to interrogatories reveals he behaved in ways that were \nintended to obstruct justice and confuse the arresting officers. Before the police \napproached his car, Applicant reached in the console, grabbed three bags of marijuana, \nand put them in his pocket. He didn\u2019t want the police to discover the marijuana. Later, \nwhen he was on the ground and the police were searching his car, he took the bags of \nmarijuana from his pocket and threw them under the police car so the police would not \nfind them. When a police officer later discovered the bags of marijuana on the ground, \nhe  asked Applicant if they belonged to him. Applicant did not respond to the officer\u2019s \nquestion. When he carried out these actions, Applicant was an off-duty federal law \nenforcement officer. When he reported these facts in response to DOHA interrogatories \nin September 2008, he expressed remorse in a personal sense but did not discuss how \nthis conduct contradicted his duties and responsibilities as a federal law enforcement \nofficer.   \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nWhen Applicant\u2019s employer learned of his arrest for marijuana possession, it \nrequired that he submit to a drug test. The drug test revealed Applicant\u2019s marijuana use, \nand his employer revoked his security clearance. \n \n \nThe allegations in the SOR raise security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d)(4) and  \n16(e)(1). AG \u00b6 16(d)(4) reads:  \n \nCredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other \nguideline and may not be sufficient in itself for an adverse determination, \nbut which, when combined with all available information supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information.  This includes but is not limited \nto consideration of. . . (4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or \nother employer\u2019s time or resources.  \n \n AG \u00b6 16(e)(1) reads: \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information about \none\u2019s conduct, that creates vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas. . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, \nprofessional, or community standing . . . .\u201d \n \n \n \nSeveral Guideline mitigating conditions might apply to the facts of this case. \nApplicant\u2019s disqualifying personal conduct might be mitigated under AG \u00b6 17(c) if \u201cthe \noffense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncase doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d) might apply if \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the behavior and \nobtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other \ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(e) might apply if \n\u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress.\u201d  AG \u00b6 17(f) might apply if \u201cthe information was \nunsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability.\u201d Finally, AG \u00b6 17(g) might \napply in mitigation if \u201cassociation with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules and regulations.\u201d \n \nApplicant has expressed regret for the behavior that led to the large cell phone \nindebtedness and the revocation of his security clearance. He provided documentation \nshowing that he was addressing the cell phone debt he owes to the federal agency \nwhere he worked as a special agent. He asserted he has no intention to use illegal \ndrugs in the future, and he stated that while he occasionally sees the individuals with \nwhom he used marijuana in March 2006, he does not actively socialize with them \nanymore. \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to follow his employer\u2019s instructions about the use of his \ngovernment cell phone and his use of marijuana while holding a security clearance was \nconsequential and occurred in 2005 and 2006. The information about these acts was \ncredible and provided by his former agency and a police department in the jurisdiction \nwhere he was arrested and charged with illegal drug possession. These acts did not \noccur under such unique circumstances that they would not seriously raise concerns \nabout his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment and perhaps impact his \neligibility for a security clearance. Applicant failed to provide documentation that he had \ntaken positive steps that might alleviate the circumstances that caused his unreliable \nconduct and, as a result, such behavior was unlikely to recur. Nothing in the record \nsuggests that Applicant took positive steps to reduce or eliminate the vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress that his behavior caused. I conclude that AG \u00b6 \n17(g) applies in mitigation to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case but that AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d), \n17(e) and 17(f) are not applicable . \n \nBecause almost every aspect of a person\u2019s life can be evaluated generally as a \nsecurity concern under Personal Conduct, I have considered all of the facts in this case \nfrom a Personal Conduct perspective. I find that when Applicant\u2019s conduct is viewed \nfrom a whole person perspective, questions remain about his judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. \n \nThe SOR alleged that a financial considerations security concern arose over \nApplicant\u2019s cell phone debt of approximately $19,245 to his former employer. However, \nat his hearing, Applicant provided documentation to corroborate his statement that he \nwas making timely payments to the agency to satisfy the debt. No other financial \ndelinquencies were alleged. I conclude that Applicant rebutted the financial \nconsiderations security concern alleged in the SOR. \n\n \n11 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s one-time use of \nmarijuana was not simply an isolated use of an illegal drug. He used the drug as an off-\nduty federal law enforcement officer who held a security clearance. When his car was \nstopped by police who undertook to search his car for illegal drugs, Applicant took \nevasive action to hide the drugs from the police and to deter their investigation. His \nprimary concern was to protect himself and his friends from the consequences of their \nillegal drug use. In September 2008, he reported this information to DOHA in response \nto interrogatories, but he did not accept responsibility, as a federal law enforcement \nofficer, for obstructing a police search. This raises continuing concerns about his \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \n \n \nApplicant has expressed an intent to abstain from illegal drug use in the future. \nHe is considered an excellent worker by his present employer. He does not actively \nsocialize with the two individuals with whom he used marijuana in 2006. He is paying \nhis former employer regularly to satisfy the debt he incurred for unauthorized use of a \ngovernment cell phone. \n \nI have considered all available, reliable information in the record about Applicant, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making this decision. At his hearing, I \ncarefully observed Applicant\u2019s demeanor and I assessed his credibility. \n \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his \ndrug involvement and personal conduct.  \n\n \n12 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 4, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 4.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Murphy, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nCharles Tucker, Jr., Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On April 23, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement),\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).\nApplicant requested a hearing.  On September 9, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Joan\nCaton Anthony denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to\nthe Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\n2\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision was arbitrary,\ncapricious or contrary to law.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable\ndecision. \nThe Judge found, inter alia, that in March 2006, Applicant used marijuana as an off-duty\nfederal law enforcement officer who held a security clearance.  She found that, at the time of the\nincident, Applicant was assigned as an armed special agent on the protection detail of a high-ranking\nfederal official and had held a security clearance for about four years.  The Judge also found that\nprior to his position as a federal law enforcement officer, Applicant had worked as a special\ninvestigator who conducted background investigations for security clearance applicants.  As such,\nhe was thoroughly familiar with the security concerns relating to illegal drug use because he was\nrequired to inquire about and investigate illegal drug use by individuals who sought access to\nclassified information.  The Judge also found that, at the time of the incident, Applicant took evasive\naction to hide the marijuana from the police and to deter their investigation.  The Judge also found\nthat in 2005, Applicant incurred over $20,000 in personal charges on a government cell phone while\nworking overseas.  \nThe Judge concluded that although Applicant\u2019s 2006 drug use was not recent and occurred\nonly once, Applicant\u2019s status as a security clearance holder and a special agent who was thoroughly\nfamiliar with government security concerns related to illegal drug use and his status as a special\nagent authorized to carry a firearm and charged with protecting a high government official, raised\nserious questions about his judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability.  She also concluded that\ndespite Applicant\u2019s stated remorse and the negative impact the 2006 incident had on his career,\ninsufficient time had passed to demonstrate a positive and permanent change in behavior.  The Judge\nalso concluded that when Applicant\u2019s marijuana use and failure to follow his employer\u2019s instructions\nabout the use of his government cell phone is viewed from a whole person perspective,  unmitigated\nquestions remain about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  In doing so, the Judge asserted\nthat because of his status as a federal law enforcement officer with a clearance who took evasive\naction on the night of the marijuana incident in an attempt to protect himself, Applicant\u2019s marijuana\nuse was not simply an isolated use of an illegal drug.  \nApplicant argues that his single instance of marijuana use sufficiently invoked pertinent\nconsiderations under Guideline H so as to mitigate any security concerns raised by a single\naberrational event.  He argues that his gross deviation from his customary behavior is not indicative\nof his judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, nor is it likely to recur.  Applicant\u2019s arguments in this\nregard do not establish error on the part of the Judge.\n             Applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue\nfor a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).  In this case, the Judge noted\nApplicant\u2019s favorable characteristics, professional accomplishments and responsible behavior since\nthe 2006 drug incident, but indicated why these factors were insufficient to overcome the\n\n3\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns given his status as a federal law enforcement officer and a former\nbackground investigator and his actions in attempting to cover up his illegal activity.  The Judge\u2019s\nconclusions in this regard are sustainable on this record.\nApplicant also argues that the Judge\u2019s decision is erroneous in part because it analyzes his\ndrug use under two different guidelines and reaches opposite conclusions.  It is permitted to do so.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-09251 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2009).  In this case, however, the Judge\u2019s\nreasoning is at least somewhat problematic in that she used contradictory language.  In concluding\nfor Applicant under Guideline J the Judge applied \u00b632(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed since the\ncriminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d\nWhereas in concluding against Applicant under Guideline H for the same conduct the Judge wrote,\n\u201cThis conduct casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.\u201d  Similarly, she\napplied Guideline J, \u00b6 32 (d), \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or\nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community involvement;\u201d in Applicant\u2019s\nfavor, but wrote under Guideline H, \u201cEven though he expressed remorse for his behavior and the\nnegative impact it had on his career, he also suggested that his arrest was unwarranted.  I conclude\nthat insufficient time has passed to demonstrate a positive and permanent change in behavior.\u201d\nApplicant is correct that there appears to be a contradiction and such contradiction is error.\nHowever, the Board concludes that the error is harmless, as the Judge\u2019s adverse conclusions\nregarding Applicant\u2019s drug use under Guideline H are sustainable and provide an adequate basis for\nher ultimate adverse security clearance decision.\nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).

One debt was disputed. She has \nestablished payment plans for resolving her remaining SOR debts. Financial \nconsideration concerns are mitigated. Personal conduct concerns are mitigated \nbecause she did not intentionally fail to list some of her delinquent debts on her security \nclearance application. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn January 3, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations \nProcessing \n(e-QIP) \nor \nsecurity \nclearance \napplication \n(SF-86) \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On November 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR (GE 12) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, \nas amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended and modified. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated \nJuly 31, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nby the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the Department of Defense \nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nThe \nSOR \nalleged \nsecurity \nconcerns \nunder \nGuidelines \nF \n(Financial \nConsiderations) and E (Personal Conduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether \nApplicant\u2019s clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn December 8, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR (GE 13). In February \n2009, Applicant\u2019s case was referred to an administrative judge. On February 18, 2009 \nand March 5, 2009, DOHA issued hearing notices (GE 8, 9). The hearing was cancelled \nafter Applicant\u2019s sponsor terminated her employment and sponsorship. \n \nIn May 2009, a government contractor sponsored Applicant for a security \nclearance. On June 10, 2009, DOHA assigned the case to me. On June 18, 2009, and \nJune 25, 2009, DOHA issued hearing notices (GE 10, 11). On July 9, 2009, Applicant\u2019s \nhearing was held. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered seven exhibits (GE 1-7) \n(Transcript (Tr.) 21-22), and Applicant offered four exhibits (Tr. 23-26; AE A-D). There \nwere no objections, and I admitted GE 1-7 (Tr. 22), and AE A-D (Tr. 23-26). \nAdditionally, I admitted four Notices of Hearings, the SOR,1 and her response to the \nSOR (GE 8-13). After the hearing, Applicant provided six exhibits (AE E-J). I received \nthe transcript on July 17, 2009. On July 20, 2009, Department Counsel did not object, \nand that same day I admitted Applicant\u2019s six exhibits (AE E-J).   \n \nFindings of Fact2 \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, she admitted she owed and had not paid the debts \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, 1.n, 1.o, 1.t, and 1.u (GE 13). She said these eight debts \nwere in a payment plan or a debt consolidation plan (GE 13). She denied the other \ndebts because they were either duplications, had inaccurate amounts, or were paid (GE \n13). Her admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is 28 years old and is seeking employment by a defense contractor (Tr. \n6, 27). She graduated from high school in 1998 (Tr. 7). She completed three years of \ncollege, where she majored in psychology (Tr. 7). She previously held a top secret \nclearance with access to sensitive compartmented information when she was on active \nduty in the U.S. Army (Tr. 8). She was on active duty in the Army from June 25, 1998 to \nJanuary 23, 2006 (Tr. 9). Her military occupational specialty was administrative \n \n1 At Department Counsel\u2019s request, I amended SOR \u00b6 2(a) at the hearing to correct a \ntypographical error (Tr. 18). The SOR and response to SOR are the pleadings in the case. The hearing \nnotices, SOR and response to SOR are admitted and given exhibit numbers for ease of reference in this \ndecision.  \n \n2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nassistant (Tr. 29-30). She was a sergeant promotable to staff sergeant when she was \ndischarged with an honorable discharge (Tr. 9, 31). She did not serve in a combat zone \nwhile on active duty (Tr. 9). She received two Good Conduct Medals, two Army \nCommendation Medals and two Army Achievement Medals (Tr. 30). She does not \ncurrently hold a security clearance (Tr. 8). She has never been married (Tr. 27). She \nhas a three-year-old son (Tr. 27). Her son\u2019s father was enlisted when they had their \nrelationship, and he was subsequently commissioned as an officer (Tr. 124).   \n \nAfter Applicant left active duty, four different companies employed her from \nJanuary 2006 to July 2007 (Tr. 31-32).  From July 25, 2007, to September 26, 2007, \nshe was unemployed (Tr. 32-33). From September 27, 2007 to February 13, 2009, a \ncompany employed her as a program analyst (Tr. 32). Beginning in August 2008, her \nincome gradually declined from $5,000 per month to about $2,500 per month. Her \nemployer gradually reduced her hours as the end of their government contract \napproached (Tr. 90). She has been unemployed since February 13, 2009 (Tr. 32).  She \ncurrently has an offer of employment from a defense contractor for $5,000 per month \n(Tr. 32, 43).   \n \nIn June 2006, Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties began (Tr. 56). She emphasized \nlack of child support payments from her son\u2019s father were a significant cause of her \nfinancial problems. Her son was born in February 2006 (GE 1). She paid $2,500 to \n$3,000 to her lawyer and for court costs to ensure she received child support payments \n(Tr. 37). In August 2008, she began receiving monthly, court-ordered child support \npayments (Tr. 34). Her son\u2019s father is now an active-duty captain in the U.S. Army (Tr. \n35). He resisted making his child support payments for two years (Tr. 35). Since \nOctober 2008, he has paid $555 for child support and an additional $145 for child \nsupport arrearage (Tr. 36-37). In April 2009, she began receiving $1,612 monthly for \nunemployment compensation (Tr. 41).     \n \nBetween October 2008 and July 2009, Applicant used debt consolidation \ncompanies that were affiliated with each other (DCCI and DCCII) as her primary \nvehicles to resolve her delinquent debts (Tr. 59-60; GE 13 at 1). In October 2008, she \nplanned to use DCC1 resolve the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, 1.n, 1.o, and 1.t (GE 13 \nat 1). Her first payment to DCC1 was $400 (AE B at 1), and then she increased her \nmonthly payment to $667 (Tr. 61).3 Her last payment to DCCI was on January 2, 2009 \nin the amount of $1,602 (Tr. 62). However, in April 2009, she stopped making payments \nto DCCI and began paying a second debt consolidation company (DCCII). DCCII was \naffiliated with DCCI and is now working on resolving her debts (Tr. 62-63). Her checking \naccount statements show payments to DCCII of $100 on April 9, 2009; $360 on May 1, \n2009, and $360 on June 2, 2009 (Tr. 88; AE B at 15, 17, 19, 21). She subsequently \nadded more SOR debts for DCCII to resolve (Tr. 86-88). Applicant received financial \ncounseling while she was on active duty and subsequently from DCCI and DCCII (Tr. \n58). In October 2008, she generated a detailed budget (GE 5 at 6, 24-26).  \n \n3 Her checking account statement showed $400 paid on October 1, 2008 (AE B at 1), $350 paid \non November 3, 2008 (AE B at 3), $667 paid on December 1, 2008 (AE B at 5), $1,602 paid on January \n2, 2009 (AE B at 7).  \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nCurrent status of SOR debts \n \nApplicant accepted responsibility for ten SOR debts and plans to pay them using \nDCCII. The specific source and status of those ten SOR are as follows: 1.b ($180\u2014\nmedical debt\u2014not paid) (Tr. 86-88);  1.c ($577\u2014payday loan\u2014not paid) (Tr. 65-66);  \n1.d ($161\u2014being paid down) (Tr. 71-72); 1.e and 1.k ($1,485\u2014duplication resulting \nfrom account overdraft\u2014being paid down) (Tr. 66-69, 103-105); 1.l ($172\u2014store debt\u2014\nnot paid) (Tr. 105); 1.o ($1,002\u2014utility debt\u2014being paid down) (Tr. 69-70); 1.p ($597\u2014\nbeing paid down) (Tr. 74-77); 1.q ($420\u2014collection company\u2014not paid); and 1.t \n($6,946\u2014Army and Air Force Exchange System\u2014being paid down) (Tr. 70).  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($18,936). Applicant has retained the vehicle on which she owes \n$18,936. Her last payment of $600 was in July 2007 (Tr. 82). She has made sporadic \nefforts to re-establish the currency of the account (Tr. 82-83). She periodically contacts \nthe creditor to let the creditor know she intends to pay her debt and she asks for \ndeferment on payments until her financial circumstances improve (Tr. 83-84).    \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f ($995\u2014account overdraft). This debt was paid by DCCI (Tr. 72-73). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g ($300\u2014education debt). This debt was paid in 2008 (Tr. 92-93).  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i ($187 and $360\u2014cable services debt). Applicant returned a \ncable box and paid the $187 on May 11, 2009 (Tr. 93-94). Both debts are resolved.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j ($1,100\u2014Department of Defense Finance and Accounting Service \n(DFAS)) is disputed. At her Office of Personnel Management (OPM) interview, Applicant \nsaid she thought the Army over paid her prior to her separation from the service, and \nDFAS was attempting to collect the overpayment (Tr. 102). She also thought this debt \nwas being turned over to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for collection; however, \nDFAS and the IRS were not able to provide information about the basis of the debt or \neven that she owed this debt (Tr. 95, 99-101). Ultimately DFAS informed her that this \ndebt was cancelled (Tr. 96, 102-103).  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.m ($147-telecommunications debt). This debt was paid on September \n8, 2008 (Tr. 106-108; GE 6 at 40). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.n ($622\u2014department store account). This debt was paid (Tr. 77-80). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.r ($290\u2014supermarket\u2014returned check). Applicant paid this debt on \nApril 14, 2008 (Tr. 112-113; AE D). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.s ($604\u2014collection company). In July 2009, Applicant paid $210 to this \ncreditor and intends to pay the remainder at the end of July 2009 (Tr. 109-110; AE I). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.u ($3,952\u2014apartment lease). Applicant was making payments of $329 \nper month; however, in December 2008, she stopped making payments because of her \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \npending unemployment (Tr. 110-111). She promised to resume payments of $329 per \nmonth when she obtains employment (Tr. 111). \n    \nApplicant\u2019s federal tax refund was provided to a debt collector to pay a non-SOR \neducation debt (Tr. 97). As of July 17, 2009, she still owes $1,653 on this education \ndebt (AE J). She promised to pay the remainder of this debt as soon as she is \nreemployed (Tr. 97-99).  \n  \nApplicant\u2019s personal financial statement \n \nOn October 6, 2008, Applicant\u2019s provided a personal financial statement (PFS) in \nresponse to DOHA interrogatories (GE 5 at 6). Her PFS showed net pay after \ndeductions of $5,195 and other income of $2,050 (includes $550 in child support \nreceived) (GE 5 at 6, 22). Her monthly expenses were: rent ($1,775); groceries ($300); \nclothing ($150); utilities ($279); car expenses ($831\u2014includes car payment of $571); \nday care ($700); and miscellaneous ($1,872) (GE 5 at 6, 22). At the time of her hearing, \nshe had moved in with a friend and was not paying any rent (Tr. 43).  She contributes \n$300 for groceries (Tr. 45). Her expenses such as car expenses and daycare are about \nthe same as in October 2008 (Tr. 45-49).  She has less than $100 in her savings and \nchecking accounts (Tr. 50-51). Her student loans are in deferment status (Tr. 52-55).    \n \nApplicant\u2019s October 2008 budget showed monthly payments to seven SOR \ncreditors totaling $768: 1.c ($18 on $577 debt); 1.d ($30 on $577 debt); 1.e ($55 on \n$1,810 debt); 1.h ($187 on $187 debt); 1.l ($172 on $172 debt); 1.o ($153 on $1,035 \ndebt); and 1.t ($153 on $6,946 debt) (GE 5 at 6, 24).   \n \nApplicant\u2019s October 2008 budget also showed monthly payments to five non-\nSOR creditors totaling $1,140: $17 on unknown amount; $300 on a $300 debt; $421 on \n$421 debt; $59 on $59 debt; and $360 on a $360 debt (GE 5 at 24, 25).  \n \nApplicant was unable to maintain this level of payments into DCCI or DCCII after \nOctober 2008. Applicant\u2019s income was significantly decreased by her subsequent \nunderemployment from October 2008 to February 2009 and her unemployment after \nFebruary 2009. \n \nAlleged falsification of security clearance applications (SF-86s) \n \nOn January 3, 2008, Applicant completed her SF-86 (Tr. 113; GE 1). In regard to \nher delinquent debts, her SF-86 asked two questions. Applicant responded \u201cNo\u201d to \nquestion 28a and \u201cYes\u201d to question 28b (GE 1). Her SF-86 required her to explain any \n\u201cYes\u201d answers. However, the only debt she disclosed was her $18,936 delinquent car \nloan as indicated in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Questions 28a and 28b asked: \n \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nSection 28: Your Financial Delinquencies \n \nAnswer the following questions. \n \na. In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any \ndebt(s)? \n \nb. Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)? \n \nApplicant\u2019s SF-86 contains the following admonition: \n \nCertification That My Answers Are True \n \nMy statements on this form, and any attachments to it, are true, complete, \nand correct to the best of my knowledge and belief and are made in good \nfaith. I understand that a knowing and willful false statement on this form \ncan be punished by fine or imprisonment or both. (See section 1001 of title \n18, United States Code). \n \n(emphasis in original) (GE 1). Immediately below this admonition appears her signature \n(GE 1). Applicant admitted that she signed and certified this SF-86 (Tr. 113-115).  \n \nApplicant explained that when she completed her SF-86 she was not aware that \nthe other debts were delinquent over 90 days (Tr. 114-119). She thought she was \nmaking the minimum payments necessary to keep her accounts current (Tr. 119). She \nobtained a credit report and provided it to the OPM investigator (Tr. 117). She went over \nher debts with the OPM investigator and provided detailed information about her debts \nand accounts (Tr. 117-119). She denied that she intentionally provided false information \non her SF-86 (Tr. 114-119).  \n \nOn May 5, 2009, Applicant submitted an SF-86 (AE A).  She disclosed multiple \nfinancial problems on her SF-86, including her DCC plan (AE A).  \n   \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcerns are under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct). \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nFinancial Considerations \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. \nOct. 26, 2006) provides, \u201cApplicant\u2019s credit report was sufficient to establish the \n[g]overnment\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant had  .  .  .  delinquent [SOR] debts that \nare of security concern.\u201d Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is also documented in her \nOPM interview, her responses to DOHA interrogatories, her SOR response, and her \noral statement at her hearing. She failed to ensure his creditors were paid as agreed. \nThe government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). \nFurther inquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is required.  \n   \n  \nFive mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because she \ndid not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve her delinquent debts. Her \ndelinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s \njurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Ten SOR debts, totaling about $14,000 \nare in a payment plan that DCCII is managing. Seven SOR debts, totaling about $2,900 \nare paid. The debt to the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.j is disputed. She has individual payment \nplans for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.s, and 1.u, totaling about $23,500. Once she \nobtains employment, which is likely because a contractor has sponsored her clearance \napplication, her delinquent debts are likely to be paid and unlikely to recur. They do not \ncast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \nApplicant receives partial credit under AG \u00b6 20(b) because her financial problems \ninitially resulted because of unemployment, underemployment, and her son\u2019s father\u2019s \nfailure to pay child support for the first two years of his life.4 She does not receive full \nmitigating credit because she did not establish that she acted with sufficient initiative \nand resolve to address her delinquent debts. She did not provide sufficient \ndocumentation about her income and expenditures over the last two years to receive full \ncredit under AG \u00b6 20(b). \n   \nAG \u00b6 20(c) fully applies. Applicant received financial counseling and prepared a \ndetailed budget. Moreover, she demonstrated a firm grasp of budgeting, payment plans, \nand expense reduction. She dramatically reduced her expenses when she became \nunemployed, and still managed to make some payments to DCCII out of her \nunemployment compensation and child support payments. She has the self-discipline \nnecessary to reduce and resolve her debts. There are \u201cclear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d She has also established full mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6 20(d) because she showed good faith5 in the resolution of her SOR debts.   \n \n4\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \n \n5The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood-faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d \nmitigating condition]. \n \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                                                            \nApplicant contested the validity of her $1,100 debt to DFAS. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not \napply because of the lack of documentation supporting her dispute. However, under all \nthe circumstances, I considered her statements to be sufficient to refute this debt. I am \nconvinced if DFAS establishes that Applicant owes the government money, she will \nrepay the government.   \n \nIn sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts \nsooner to resolve her delinquent debts. Her debts resulted from lack of child support, \nunderemployment, and unemployment. Her SOR listed 21 debts totaling about $41,300. \nShe paid seven debts. Ten debts are being resolved through DCCII. One debt is \ndisputed. Three debts are in separate payment plans. She promised to continue to \ncomply with her payment plans until all of her SOR debts are resolved. I am confident \nshe will keep her promise6 because of her continued progress on SOR debt resolution \ndespite her unemployment.    \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case in regard to the allegation Applicant provided a false security \nclearance application: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n6 Of course, the government can re-validate Applicant\u2019s financial status at any time through credit \nreports, investigation and/or additional interrogatories. Approval of a clearance now does not bar the \ngovernment from subsequently revoking it, if warranted. Violation of a promise made in a security context \nto pay legitimate debts also raises judgment concerns under Guideline E, and may support future \nrevocation of a security clearance. Completion of a security clearance decision documents and \nestablishes a warning to Applicants about the importance of financial responsibility and retention of \ndocumentation about debt resolution. The comments in this footnote do not imply that this clearance is \nconditional. \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \nOn January 3, 2008, Applicant provided an SF-86, which asked questions about \ndebts more than 180-days delinquent in the last seven years and about debts currently \nmore than 90-days delinquent. Applicant correctly responded \u201cYes\u201d to the question \nabout debts currently 90-days delinquent. She disclosed her largest debt, a car loan of \nalmost $19,000, which was delinquent over 90 days. She admitted she failed to disclose \nother, smaller debts that were also delinquent over 90 days. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) both \napply because she provided an incomplete answer about her delinquent debts. Further \nreview is necessary. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns in this case: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \n \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nApplicant credibly stated that when she completed her SF-86, she was not aware \nthat other, smaller debts were also delinquent over 90 days. In January 2008, she was \nattempting to keep her smaller debts current by making minimal payments. On February \n20, 2008, she provided detailed information about her delinquent debts to an OPM \ninvestigator. She also provided a credit report to the OPM investigation. In May 2009, \nshe completed an SF-86 and provided complete information about her delinquent debts. \nShe was candid and forthright at her hearing about her financial problems. I conclude \nApplicant\u2019s alleged falsification of her SF-86 is mitigated. Although she provided \nincomplete information on her January 3, 2008 SF-86, AG \u00b6 17(f) fully applies. The \nfalsification allegations are not substantiated. I am satisfied she did not deliberately and \nintentionally fail to disclose her delinquent debts with intent to deceive.7 I find \u201cFor \nApplicant\u201d in the Findings section of this decision with respect to SOR \u00b6 2.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines F and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n7The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission. \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)). \n\n \n13 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n  \n There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial conduct. In \nOctober 2008, her monthly income, including child support, was about $7,500. In \nOctober 2008, she established a payment plan with DCCI. However, she had sufficient \nincome to have made greater progress resolving her delinquent debts. She should have \nbeen more aggressive in her efforts to ensure she established payment plans to resolve \nher delinquent debts. She did not fully document her payments to her creditors, and her \ncommunications to creditors about her debts. These factors show some financial \nirresponsibility and lack of judgment. Her history of delinquent debt raises sufficient \nsecurity concerns to merit further inquiry.   \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is sufficient to warrant \nreinstatement of Applicant\u2019s security clearance. There is no evidence of a security \nviolation. She is a law-abiding citizen. Her current financial problems were caused by \nfactors beyond her control: (1) insufficient income; (2) her son\u2019s father\u2019s failure to pay \nchild support over the first two years of his son\u2019s life; (3) unemployment, especially after \nFebruary 2009; and (4) underemployment. Her SOR lists 21 debts totaling about \n$41,300. She paid seven debts, totaling about $2,900. Ten debts totaling about $14,000 \nare in DCCII\u2019s payment plan. She has a payment plan for three SOR debts; however, \nshe is currently only paying into one of the plans because of her current unemployment. \nShe disputes her DFAS debt. Applicant has been unemployed since February 2009, \nand receives substantial credit for making some payments to DCCII and to her other \ncreditors when she is under great financial pressure (her current income is only about \n$2,300 a month from unemployment compensation and child support). The Appeal \nBoard has addressed a key element in the whole person analysis in financial cases \nstating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation \nand his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for \nthe reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6  E2.2(a) (\u2018Available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.\u2019) There is no requirement that a plan provide for \npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable \nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such \ndebts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts \nactually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in \nthe SOR. \n \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nGreg T. Rinckey, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On January 2, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement),\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On May\n29, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Mark Harvey denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\n1The Judge\u2019s favorable findings under Guidelines H and J are not at issue in this appeal.  \n210 U.S.C. \u00a7 815.  Applicant\u2019s DD 214, attached as an exhibit to GE 2, Response to Interrogatories, shows that\nhe left active duty in October 2005.  \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Government had presented\nsubstantial evidence of the Guideline E security concern and whether the Judge erred in his\napplication of the pertinent mitigating conditions.1  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a cost analyst for a\ndefense contractor.  He joined the U.S. Marine Corps in 1999.  From September 2002 until May\n2003, while in the Marines, Applicant used one cycle of steroids.  A cycle is a four to six week\nperiod of frequent steroid injections.  The injections occur during the first half of the cycle; during\nthe second half the injections are less frequent or there is no steroid use at all.  He also used steroids\nfrom March 2005 to April 2005.  He was punished under Article 15, Uniform Code of Military\nJustice,2 for this second cycle of steroid use.  On September 13, 2007, Applicant signed his security\nclearance application (SCA).  When asked about drug use he mentioned the steroids injected in\n2005, but he omitted the cycle occurring in 2002 to 2003.  In a subsequent set of DOHA\ninterrogatories Applicant disclosed the earlier steroid use but omitted the use in 2005.  \nApplicant argues that the Government has not met its burden of producing substantial\nevidence of  Guideline E security concerns arising out of Applicant\u2019s omission of steroid use on his\n2007 SCA.  In evaluating whether the Government has presented substantial evidence regarding the\ndeliberate nature of a false statement or an omission, the Judge must examine the statement or\nomission in light of the record as a whole. When an applicant claims that a false answer to a SCA\nquestion is not deliberate, the Judge should address explicitly any contrary evidence in the record.\nISCR Case No. 07-03307 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2008).  In this case, the Judge has examined the\nomission in light of the record as a whole.  He paid particular attention to record evidence that\nApplicant had made subsequent false statements about his steroid use.  His conclusion that\nApplicant\u2019s omission on the 2007 SCA was willful is sustainable on this record.  After reviewing\nthe record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a\nsatisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 28-year-old cost analyst for a defense contractor (Tr. 46). Applicant graduated from high school in 1999 and joined the Marine Corps on July 6, 1999 (Tr. 33, 46).

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Greg T. Rinckey, Esquire \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \nHARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant\u2019s most recent steroid use was in 2005. Security concerns related to \ndrug involvement are mitigated. He deliberately failed to fully disclose the extent of his \nsteroid use on his 2007 security clearance application. He failed to mitigate security \nconcerns arising from personal conduct. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 13, 2007, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) also known as a security clearance application (2007 \nSF 86) (Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On January 2, 2009, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant \nto Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The revised adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \nMay 29, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines H (Drug Involvement), J \n(Criminal Conduct), and E (Personal Conduct) (GE 11). The SOR detailed reasons why \nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn February 7, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations (GE 11). \nDepartment Counsel was ready to proceed on April 8, 2009, and the case was assigned \nto me on April 14, 2009. At the hearing held on May 1, 2009, Department Counsel \noffered seven exhibits (GE 1-7) (Transcript (Tr.) 18-19). There were no objections, and I \nadmitted GE 1-7 (Tr. 19). Applicant did not provide any exhibits (Tr. 7). I also admitted a \nhearing notice, an amended hearing notice, the SOR, a notice of appearance, and \nApplicant\u2019s SOR response (GE 8-12). I received the transcript on May 18, 2009.   \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \nDepartment Counsel elected not to present evidence to support SOR \u00b6 2, which \nalleged Applicant\u2019s steroid use constituted criminal conduct under Guideline J (Tr. 11-\n12). Applicant\u2019s counsel did not object to my proposal to find \u201cFor Applicant\u201d (Tr. 12), \nand I have done so without addressing Guideline J in my Analysis.1   \n \nFindings of Fact2 \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b to \n1.e and denied partial or full culpability for the remaining SOR allegations (GE 12). His \nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough \nreview of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 28-year-old cost analyst for a defense contractor (Tr. 46). Applicant \ngraduated from high school in 1999 and joined the Marine Corps on July 6, 1999 (Tr. \n33, 46). His specialty in the Marine Corps was electrical equipment repairman (Tr. 46). \nHe is married and has two stepchildren, ages 15 and 17 (Tr. 40, 66). His employment \nfor the contractor sponsoring his clearance involved supervision of 40 foreign nationals, \nwho were providing security in Iraq, as well as providing personal security for individuals \nin Iraq (Tr. 42). The contract in Iraq ended in April 2009 and Applicant returned to the \nUnited States, where he obtained temporary employment with another government \ncontractor (Tr. 43).   \n \n1Three other procedural matters merit brief mention. Applicant\u2019s sponsor for his clearance \ncontinued to sponsor his security clearance, even though he began new employment shortly before his \nhearing (Tr. 31-32, 43, 69-70). Applicant waived the 15-day notice requirement for the start of the hearing \n(Tr. 12-13; GE 8, 9). I disclosed I was acquainted with a corporate officer at the corporation sponsoring \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance (Tr. 70). The parties did not object to my continuation as administrative \njudge in this case (Tr. 70-71).  \n \n2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits.  \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nOn August 27, 2004, the Department of the Navy Central Adjudication Facility \n(DON CAF) approved a conditional Top Secret clearance for Applicant (GE 6). The \nDON CAF warned Applicant to \u201cavoid any personal or criminal conduct involving \nquestionable judgment or unreliability\u201d (GE 6).  \n \nApplicant has never been charged with any felony, firearms or explosives offense \n(GE 1). He has not been charged with any minor or misdemeanor-type, non-traffic-\nrelated offenses in the last seven years (GE 1). In the last seven years, he has not had \nany debts delinquent over 180 days, bankruptcy petitions, unpaid judgments, or unpaid \nliens (GE 1). \n \nApplicant\u2019s DD Form 214 listed the following ribbons and awards: Marine Corps \nGood Conduct Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, National Defense \nService Medal, Navy and Marine Corps Overseas Service Ribbon, Sea Service \nDeployment Ribbon, Navy Unit Commendation, Secretary of the Navy Letter of \nCommendation, Letter of Appreciation (2d award), Meritorious Mast (3d award), and \nCertificate of Appreciation.  \n \nSteroid Possession and Use \n \n \nWhile Applicant was assigned to be a security guard at an overseas embassy, he \nused steroids for one cycle3 during the period from about September 2002 to May 2003 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a; Tr. 36; GE 12). He was using steroids with about four other U.S. Marines \n(Tr. 53). A cycle is a four-to-12 week period of frequent steroid injections during about \nhalf of the cycle (Tr. 35, 49-50, 52). He used steroids to have larger muscle mass and to \nimprove his physical fitness test scores (Tr. 53). The remainder of the cycle has less \nfrequent or no steroid use (Tr. 35). Applicant had a Department of Defense (DoD) \nsecurity clearance at the time he was using steroids in 2002-2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.b; Tr. 47-\n48; GE 12).  \n \nApplicant used steroids over about a six-week period from March 2005 to April \n2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.c; Tr. 50; GE 12). On May 25, 2005, Applicant received nonjudicial \npunishment for use of steroids (SOR \u00b6 1.d; GE 12). He received a reduction in grade to \nLance Corporal (E-3), restriction and extra duty for 45 days, and forfeiture of one half of \none month\u2019s pay for one month (SOR \u00b6 1.d; Tr. 39-40; GE 3, 4, 12). His DoD-issued \nsecurity clearance was in effect when he used steroids in 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.d; GE 12).   \n \nApplicant has not received any drug counseling (Tr. 54). Applicant does not \ncurrently associate with drug users (Tr. 45). He believes his steroid use was wrongful, \nand accepted responsibility for this misconduct (Tr. 63). Applicant denied illegal drug \nuse after his steroid use in 2005 (Tr. 40). He has changed because of his marriage and \nrecognition that he is responsible for two stepchildren (Tr. 40). Bible study is very \nimportant to Applicant (Tr. 44-45).  \n \n \n \n3 Applicant used steroids for one cycle in 2002-2003 and one cycle in 2005 (Tr. 36, 50; GE 12).    \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nFalsification of 2007 Security Clearance Application \n \nOn September 13, 2007, Applicant signed his SF 86 (SOR \u00b6 3.a; Tr. 55; GE 1). \nOn his 2007 SF 86 he responded, \u201cYes\u201d to Sections 24a and 24b, which ask: \n \n24. Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity  \n \na. Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have \nyou illegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana, \ncocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, \nheroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, methaqualone, \ntranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription \ndrugs?    \n \nb. Have you ever illegally used a controlled substance while employed as \na law enforcement officer, prosecutor, or courtroom official; while \npossessing a security clearance; or while in a position directly and \nimmediately affecting the public safety? \n \nOn his 2007 SF 86, he explained that from April 2005 to August 2005 he used \nSteroids once. He specifically noted, \u201cUsed [steroids] one time expirementally (sic) and \nwill NOT ever use again (emphasis added).\u201d He noted that he used marijuana one time \nin January 1999 when he was a senior in high school (GE 1).4  \n \nIn the Additional Comments section of the 2007 SF 86, Applicant elaborated on \nhis drug use stating, \u201dI used Steroids one time while I was in the Marine Corps and have \nnever touched or wanted to use it again. I used marijuana a few times in my Senior year \nof High School, and I have refrained from using since, seeing as I joined the Marines \nimmediately after High School (emphasis added)\u201d (GE 1 at \u00a7 24).  \n \nOn May 25, 2005, a Marine Corps investigator interviewed Applicant about his \nsteroid use (GE 5).5 Applicant signed a sworn statement and disclosed that he used \nsteroids and lifted weights for six months while on an overseas assignment to embassy \nduty (GE 5 at 2). He gained about 60 pounds over those six months (GE 5 at 2). He \nused steroids again from March 2005 to April 16, 2005 (GE 5 at 2). He injected steroids \nonce every three days at first, then twice every two days, then twice every day and then \ntapered off to every third day (GE 5 at 2). He was using Testosterone Propionate, Deca-\nDurabolin, Sustanon, and Dianabol\u201d (GE 5 at 3). \n \nOn October 27, 2008, in response to two DOHA interrogatories about his most \nrecent marijuana use, Applicant said he, used marijuana three or four times from \n                                            \n4The question sought drug use in the last seven years, and his marijuana use was more than \nseven years previously (Tr. 59). \n \n5Applicant falsely told the investigator that no other Marines in his unit were using steroids (Tr. \n61). \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nJanuary 1999 to June 1999 (GE 2 at 2). He used steroids during two cycles from \nSeptember 2002 to May 2003 (GE 2 at 2). He noted that he \u201cdecided to stop using \nsteroids after his last cycle. I decided to stop using steroids because I became more \naware of the health dangers, and my family has a history of heart problems, so I \ndecided that I want to live as long as possible.\u201d (GE 2 at 2). Applicant said his DOHA \ninterrogatory, rather than his 2001 and 2007 security clearance applications, had \naccurate information about the number of his marijuana uses in high school (Tr. 60).6  \n \nAt his hearing Applicant emphasized that he was incorrect in his description of \nhis steroid use on his 2007 SF 86, and he explained why he did not disclose his 2002-\n2003 steroid use: \n \nI\u2019m honestly not sure. I guess I might have been in a hurry, and I was just \ntrying to get it done. But if you look at the explanation, later, I did say that I \ndid use steroids two cycles (referring to the responses on the DOHA \ninterrogatories). \n \n*  *  * \n \nLike I said, I must have just been going through it real quickly, and just \nwasn\u2019t paying attention to detail. I just completely forgot about the one in \n2002. I hadn\u2019t been charged for it, or anything like that. So it is not \nsomething that is in the forefront of my mind, where I\u2019m constantly thinking \nabout it. \n \n(Tr. 37, 57, 63). When he said he used steroids \u201conce\u201d he meant he used steroids \nmultiple times, but it was only one cycle (Tr. 61-62). He noted, however, that on the \nDOHA interrogatories he disclosed the 2002-2003 steroid use, but not the 2005 steroid \nuse (Tr. 38). He attributed the failure to accurately disclose his steroid use on his DOHA \ninterrogatories to \u201can oversight\u201d (Tr. 38-39) and \u201cinattention to detail\u201d (Tr. 58). \n \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor (S) served in the Marine Corps for eight years and left \nactive duty as a Staff Sergeant (Tr. 23). S was discharged from the Marine Corps in \nOctober 2001 with an Honorable Discharge (Tr. 23). S held a Top Secret clearance (Tr. \n24). S has worked in Information Technology for his current employer for six years (Tr. \n24).  S hired Applicant as an electronics technician in March 2007 (Tr. 22, 24). Applicant \nworked for his firm until May 2008 (Tr. 25). S has met Applicant\u2019s wife and children, and \nthey have been to each other\u2019s residences (Tr. 27-28). S observed and supervised \nApplicant\u2019s work performance on a daily basis (Tr. 25). Applicant received an \noutstanding performance rating (Tr. 25). Applicant\u2019s behavior was excellent (Tr. 25-26). \n \n \n6 He attributed his decision not to disclose accurate information about his marijuana use on his \n2001 security clearance application to advice from his recruiter (Tr. 60).   \n \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nS rehired Applicant in April 2009 (Tr. 26-27). Applicant\u2019s employment on this current \nproject requires a security clearance (Tr. 29-31).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse met him in 2005, and they married in October 2005 (Tr. 66). \nShe has never known her husband to use illegal drugs (Tr. 67). He does not associate \nwith individuals who use illegal drugs (Tr. 67). Applicant is a good husband and father to \nher children (Tr. 68). The family missed Applicant when he was in Iraq (Tr. 68). \nApplicant is honest and trustworthy (Tr. 68).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nan Applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcerns are under Guidelines H (Drug Involvement) and E (Personal Conduct) with \nrespect to the allegations set forth in the SOR. \n \nDrug Involvement \n \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the security concern concerning drug involvement: \n \n[u]se of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes eight drug involvement-related conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Three drug involvement disqualifying conditions \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this particular case: \u201c(a) any \ndrug abuse,\u201d7 \u201c(c) illegal drug possession or sale or distribution,\u201d and \u201c(g) any illegal \ndrug use after being granted a security clearance.\u201d8 \n \n7AG \u00b6 24(b) defines \u201cdrug abuse\u201d as \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner \nthat deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d \n \n8 Applicant\u2019s steroid use on active duty violated Article 112a, Uniform Code of Military Justice \n(UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 912a. See United States v. Commander, 39 M.J. 972, 975-977 (A.F.C.M.R. 1994) \n(noting possession of Deca-Durabolin among other anabolic steroids violated Article 112a, UCMJ, as this \nsubstance was listed as a Schedule III controlled substance). \n \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n    \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c) and 25(g) apply. These disqualifying conditions apply \nbecause Applicant used and possessed steroids.9 He fully disclosed his drug abuse in \nhis SOR response and at his hearing. He possessed anabolic steroids before he used \nthem. Applicant held a security clearance at the time he used anabolic steroids. The \nother disqualifying conditions listed in AG \u00b6 25 are not applicable.  \n  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 26 provides for potentially applicable drug involvement mitigating \nconditions:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance \nfor any violation. \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n \nConcerning AG \u00b6 26(a), there are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when \nconduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be based \u201con a careful evaluation of the \ntotality of the record within the parameters set by the directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-\n \n9AG \u00b6 24(a) defines \u201cdrugs\u201d as substances that alter mood and behavior, including: \n \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the \nControlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, \ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other \nsimilar substances. \n \nTitle 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c) contains Schedules I through V of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (as \namended). Title 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(41)(A) defines the term \"anabolic steroid\" to mean \u201cany drug or \nhormonal substance, chemically and pharmacologically related to testosterone (other than estrogens, \nprogestins, corticosteroids, and dehydroepiandrosterone),\u201d and then the statute lists a variety of specific \nchemical substances. Anabolic steroids are a Schedule (Sch.) III controlled substance. See Sch. III(e).  \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). For example, the Appeal Board determined in ISCR \nCase No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 1997), that an applicant's last use of marijuana \noccurring approximately 17 months before the hearing was not recent. If the evidence \nshows \u201ca significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,\u201d \nthen an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates \n\u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or \nrehabilitation.\u201d10 \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) applies. Applicant\u2019s last drug use was in May 2005, about four years \nprior to his hearing. His overall illegal drug use was relatively brief, and involved two \ncycles of anabolic use and a few marijuana uses in high school. The absence of \nevidence of more recent or extensive drug use, and his promise not to use illegal drugs \nin the future eliminates doubts about his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment with respect to abstaining from illegal drug use.11   \n   \nAG \u00b6 26(b) lists four ways Applicant can demonstrate his intent not to abuse \nillegal drugs in the future. He has disassociated from his drug-using associates and \ncontacts. He has broken or reduced the prevalence of his patterns of drug abuse, and \nhe has changed his own life with respect to illegal drug use. He has abstained from drug \nabuse for about four years. However, he did not provide \u201ca signed statement of intent \nwith automatic revocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d AG \u00b6 26(b) partially applies.  \n \n10 ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). In ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. \nBd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board reversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the \nabsence of drug use for five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge \nexcessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 plus years of drug \nuse, and gave too little weight to lifestyle change and therapy. For the recency analysis the Appeal Board \nstated:  \n \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although the passage \nof three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did not, standing alone, compel \nthe administrative judge to apply Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of \nlaw, the Judge erred by failing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply \nthat mitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) with ISCR \nCase No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe administrative judge articulated a \nrational basis for why she had doubts about the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at \nalcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) (citation format corrections added). \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-11392 at 1-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2006) the Appeal Board, considered the recency \nanalysis of an administrative judge stating: \n \nThe administrative judge made sustainable findings as to a lengthy and serious history of \nimproper or illegal drug use by a 57-year-old Applicant who was familiar with the security \nclearance process. That history included illegal marijuana use two to three times a year \nfrom 1974 to 2002 [drug use ended four years before hearing].  It also included the illegal \npurchase of marijuana and the use of marijuana while holding a security clearance. \n \n11In ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 8 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004), the Appeal Board reversed an \nunfavorable security clearance decision because the administrative judge failed to explain why drug use \nwas not mitigated after the passage of more than six years from the previous drug abuse. \n \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(c) and 26(d) are not applicable because Applicant did not abuse \nprescription drugs after being prescribed those drugs for an illness or injury. The \nsteroids were never lawfully prescribed for him. He did not satisfactorily complete a \nprescribed drug treatment program. Moreover, he did not provide proof of a \u201cfavorable \nprognosis by a duly qualified medical professional\u201d as required in AG \u00b6 26(d). \n  \nIn sum, Applicant ended his relatively isolated drug abuse in May 2005, about \nfour years ago.12 His illegal drug use is not recent. The motivations to stop using illegal \ndrugs are evident. He understands the adverse results from drug abuse.13  He promised \nnot to use illegal drugs in the future. Drug involvement security concerns are mitigated. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes three conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying with respect to the alleged falsifications of documents used to process \nthe adjudication of Applicant\u2019s security clearance in this case: \n \n12The Appeal Board has reversed decisions granting a clearance because the administrative \njudge considered individual acts of misconduct one-by-one and determined the isolated acts were \nmitigated. ISCR Case No. 07-03431 at 4 (App. Bd. June 27, 2008); ISCR Case No. 06-08708 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 17, 2007); ISCR Case No. 04-07714 at 5-7 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2006). In ISCR Case No. 07-\n03431 at 4 (App. Bd. June 27, 2008), the Appeal Board explained it is the overall conduct that determines \nwhether a clearance should be granted stating: \n \nThe Judge's analysis of the numerous acts of misconduct in this record failed to reflect a \nreasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole.  By analyzing each category \nof incidents separately, the Judge failed to consider the significance of the \u201cevidence as a \nwhole\u201d and Applicant's pattern of conduct. See, e.g., Raffone v. Adams, 468 F.2d 860, \n866 (2d Cir. 1972)(taken together, separate events may have a significance that is \nmissing when each event is viewed in isolation). Under the whole person concept, a \nJudge must consider the totality of Applicant's conduct when deciding whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0350 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 31, 1999). The Judge\u2019s \npiecemeal analysis of Applicant's overall conduct did not satisfy the requirements of \u00b6 \nE2.2 of the Directive. \n \nSee also ISCR Case No. 04-07714 at 5-7 (App. Bd.

Even more egregiously, he typed two false statements into \nthe comment sections of his 2007 SF 86. He stated he, \u201cUsed [steroids] one time \nexpirementally (sic) and will NOT ever use again (emphasis added).\u201d And he stated, \u201dI \nused Steroids one time while I was in the Marine Corps and have never touched or \nwanted to use it again.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a), 16(b) and 16(d)(3) all apply. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this \ncase: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n                                            \n14The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:\n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission.  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)).  \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \nThe mitigating condition outlined in AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(d) and 17(e), \u201cthe individual has \nacknowledged the behavior\u201d and \u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or \neliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress\u201d partially apply to mitigate \nhis steroid use and his falsification of his 2007 SF 86. Security officials are well aware of \nApplicant\u2019s problems. Applicant has taken the positive step of disclosure, eliminating \nany vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation or duress with respect to this misconduct. \nI do not believe Applicant would compromise national security to avoid public disclosure \nof these problems.  \n \nApplicant deserves substantial credit in the whole person analysis for admitting \nhis steroid use in 2002-2003 and in 2005, when he was under investigation in May 2005 \nfor steroid use. He re-admitted his steroid use during these two periods at his hearing \nand in his SOR response. I found Applicant\u2019s admissions about his steroid use at his \nhearing and in his SOR response to be credible. However, the personal conduct \nconcerns pertaining to Applicant\u2019s falsification of his 2007 security clearance application \n(SOR \u00b6 3.a) about the extent of his steroid use cannot be mitigated at this time because \nit is too serious and too recent. He denied that he deliberately falsified his 2007 security \nclearance application and attributes the false information to lack of attention to detail, \ninadvertence, or oversight. I do not find these explanations to be credible. He \naffirmatively added one-time steroid use to the comments on his 2007 SF 86. Moreover, \nhis 2007 SF 86, when viewed in its entirety, does show careful, attention to detail with \nrespect to his traffic fines and employment. I believe he deliberately understated his \nsteroid use on his 2007 SF 86.   \n \n\n \n13 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nWhole Person Concept \n \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral change; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines H and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nThere is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance. Applicant \nwas relatively young and immature when he used marijuana and steroids. He honorably \nserved his country as a U.S. Marine for six years, rising to the rank of corporal. He \nshowed he has the ability to abstain from illegal drug use for lengthy periods of time. In \nhis SOR response and at his hearing, he admitted his history of illegal drug use. He \nknows the consequences of drug abuse. Applicant contributes to his company and the \nDepartment of Defense. He served in Iraq as a contractor employee, facing danger and \nhardship on behalf of the United States. There is no evidence of disloyalty or that he \nwould intentionally violate national security. His character and good work performance \nshow some responsibility, rehabilitation and mitigation. His supervisors evidently \nsupport him or he would not have been able to retain his employment after his security \nclearance was called into question. His supervisor lauds his hard work and dedication. I \nam satisfied that if he continues to abstain from drug use, and avoids future offenses he \nwill eventually have future potential for access to classified information.  \n \nThe evidence against approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial at \nthis time. Applicant used steroids in the period 2002\u20142003 and in 2005 for a total of \ntwo cycles. His decisions to possess and use steroids (each time he injected the \nsubstance into his body was a separate decision about whether to violate the law) were \nknowledgeable, voluntary, and intentional. Applicant failed to fully disclose his steroid \nuse on his 2007 SF 86. In the 2002\u20142003 timeframe, he used steroids for about six \nmonths and gained about 60 pounds, going from 160 pounds to 220 pounds. This is \nmore than a brief experimental use of steroids. Then in 2005, he used steroids again, \nwas questioned by investigators, and disciplined under the UCMJ for steroid use. These \nevents are too important to inadvertently or accidently fail to include, while adding to the \n\n \n14 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \ncomments that his steroid use was a one-time event. He was sufficiently mature to be \nfully responsible for his conduct. These offenses show a serious lack of judgment and a \nfailure to abide by the law. Such judgment lapses are material in the context of security \nrequirements. His misconduct raises a serious security concern, and a security \nclearance is not warranted at this time.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the security concerns pertaining to personal conduct; however, he has fully \nmitigated drug involvement primarily because his illegal drug use is not recent. His \ncriminal conduct is mitigated because the government did not present any evidence \nrelating to the applicability of this guideline.     \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d15 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not currently eligible for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:    \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.d: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:   \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n \n15See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

On \nJanuary 16, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny her \napplication, citing security concerns under Guideline F. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on \nDecember 29, 2005.  \n \nJune 19, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on January 29, 2009; answered it on February 11, \n2009; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the \nrequest on February 13, 2009. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on March 13, \n2009, and the case was assigned to me on March 16, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on March 30, 2009, scheduling the hearing for April 21, 2009. Applicant \nretained an attorney, who entered his appearance on April 13, 2009. On April 16, 2009, \nApplicant, acting through her attorney, requested a continuance until May 16, 2009. I \ngranted the request, and DOHA issued a second notice of appearance on the same \nday, scheduling the hearing for May 16, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified, presented the testimony of three witnesses, and submitted \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through O, which were admitted without objection. The \nrecord closed upon adjournment of the hearing on May 16, 2009. DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) on May 28, 2009. \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \n \nOn June 11, 2009, after the record had closed, Applicant\u2019s attorney requested \nthat the record be reopened for the purpose of admitting evidence that Applicant had \nentered into a contract to sell the house on which the mortgage payments were past \ndue. I granted the request, with no objection by Department Counsel. Applicant\u2019s motion \nand the sales contract were admitted as AX P. Department Counsel\u2019s comments are \nattached to the record as Hearing Exhibit I. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the delinquent debt alleged in the \nSOR. Her admissions in her answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings \nof fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 70-year-old security assistant employed by a federal contractor. \nShe has worked for her current employer since December 2000. She was a federal civil \nservice employee from June 1963 to September 1993, when she retired. She received a \nsecurity clearance in April 2003.  \n \n \nApplicant was married in July 1960 and divorced in December 1981. She \nremarried on March 1990. Her second husband died in February 1991. She has three \nadult sons. \n \n \nIn August 2007, her youngest son, age 44, asked Applicant to help him buy a \nhome, because he was unable to obtain a loan by himself. He is divorced and has \ncustody of his two children. Applicant agreed, assuming that she would be a cosigner \non the loan. Her son promised to make the payments. He was employed at the time and \nassured Applicant he was earning enough to make the payments (Tr. 47). He testified \nhis monthly take-home pay at the time he purchased the home was about $3,300. The \nmonthly loan payment of $2,751 left him only $500 or $600 per month for all other living \n\n \n3 \n \n \nexpenses (Tr. 74). He testified he did not know how much the monthly payments would \nbe until after the loan closed (Tr. 74). \n \nApplicant\u2019s son had lived in another state for years, and Applicant was not aware \nthat he had previous financial problems (Tr. 57). She did not read the documents \ncarefully at closing and did not realize that, although she and her son are listed as co-\nowners on the deed, she was solely responsible for the loan (Tr. 27). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s son purchased the property for about $253,000, with no down \npayment (Tr. 45). The property was assessed at $257,900 for tax purposes (AX M; Tr. \n36), and was recently appraised at $230,000 (AX N; Tr. 41).  \n \n \nApplicant learned from a security investigator that the payments on the mortgage \nwere delinquent. She questioned her son, who told her he was \u201ca couple of payments \nbehind,\u201d and that he would take care of it. She was unaware that her son\u2019s payment \ncheck in October 2007 was dishonored for insufficient funds, and that notices of default \nhad been mailed to him in November 2007, December 2007, January 2008, February \n2008, and August 2008 (AX B through F). The notices were addressed to Applicant but \nmailed to her son\u2019s address (Tr. 32).  \n \nWhen Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories in September 2008, she was \nstill under the impression that her son was the primary borrower and she was a cosigner \n(GX 4 at 4; Tr. 51-52). As of the date of the hearing, her son had been laid off for about \na month and was unemployed. He testified he was in the process of opening a teen \nclub, but the club had not yet opened (Tr. 50, 61-62). He testified he did not tell \nApplicant the loan was in default because he was ashamed and embarrassed (Tr. 64).  \n \n \nWhen Applicant received the SOR in January 2009, she realized that the loan \npayments were about $26,000 in arrears (Tr. 29). Her credit report dated May 19, 2008, \nreflected that the account was more than 180 days past due (GX 3 at 3). Applicant \ncontacted the lender, who agreed to not foreclose on the property. She listed the \nproperty with a realtor, and the lender agreed to permit a short sale. Applicant testified \nthat, if the property did not sell, she would find a renter for the property, try to refinance \nthe loan, or move into the house and live there while making the payments (Tr. 35-36).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s net monthly income from her current employment, Social Security, \nand civil service retirement totals about $4,321. She lives in a rental property and pays \nmonthly rent of $1,299. Her total monthly expenses, including rent, are about $2,672, \nleaving a remainder of about $1,649 (AX H through K). \n \nOn June 6, 2009, after the record had closed, Applicant entered into a contract to \nsell the house for $210,000. The contract is contingent on the buyer obtaining financing \nand \u201cbank approval.\u201d The closing date is on or about July 30, 2009 (AX P). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor considers her trustworthy, totally dedicated and an \noutstanding performer (Tr. 79). Applicant informed her supervisor of the problem arising \n\n \n4 \n \n \nfrom the delinquent loan, and she kept her informed of her dealings with the mortgage \ncompany and the realtor (Tr. 81-83). \n \n \nA friend of Applicant for 65 years and a former coworker during Applicant\u2019s \nemployment in civil service was aware of the problem with the delinquent loan. She \nconsiders Applicant one of the \u201cmost forthright, honest, trustworthy people\u201d she had \nencountered in her personal life and professional career (Tr. 87). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\n \n5 \n \n \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe SOR alleges a single delinquent debt of about $26,166. The concern under \nthis guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n \nTwo potentially disqualifying conditions are relevant. AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised where \nthere is an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there \nis \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d I conclude AG \u00b6 19(a) is not raised, \nbecause Applicant has the financial ability and willingness to satisfy this debt. AG \u00b6 \n19(b) is raised, however, by the multiple delinquent payments for which Applicant is \nliable. \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise AG \u00b6 19(b), the \nburden shifted to Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. \nBd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \n\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(a). The delinquent debt \n\n \n6 \n \n \nis recent, but it is an isolated incident and occurred under circumstances that are not \nlikely to recur. In the context of Applicant\u2019s long government service, her excellent \nreputation, and her responsible actions to resolve the debt, it does not cast doubt on her \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person=s \ncontrol and responsible conduct, must be established. The debt arose largely because \nof her son\u2019s loss of employment and his irresponsible and deceptive behavior, which \nwere beyond her control. Applicant reacted responsibly by contacting the lender and \ntaking steps to resolve the debt. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(c). Applicant \nhas not sought or received financial counseling, but she has retained an attorney and \nthe problem is being resolved. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(d). The concept of good faith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in \na way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or \nobligation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). \nApplicant promptly contacted the lender, obtained approval for a short sale, and listed \nthe house with a realtor. She devised a realistic fall-back plan if the house was not sold \nquickly. On June 6, 2009, she entered into a contract to sell the house. Although the \nsale has not closed and the debt is not yet resolved, the contract shows Applicant\u2019s \ngood-faith efforts to resolve the debt. It also shows she has established a realistic plan \nto resolve her financial problem and has taken significant actions to implement the plan. \nSee ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). I conclude AG \u00b6 20(d) is \nestablished.   \n \nApplicant did not submit documentary evidence of her negotiations with the \nlender, but her testimony was corroborated by the testimony of her son and her \nsupervisor. There is no evidence that the lender has initiated foreclosure. Applicant \nsubmitted a copy of the appraisal she obtained in anticipation of selling the house and a \ncopy of the recently-executed sales contract. She also provided documentary evidence \nof her financial situation, establishing her ability to pay the debt. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n7 \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature adult, with a long record of federal service. She is highly \nregarded by her current employer. She has held a clearance for more than six years, \napparently without incident. She was candid, sincere, and credible at the hearing. In \nhindsight, her failure to question her son about his ability to pay the mortgage, and her \nlack of attention to the mortgage documents were poor decisions. On the other hand, \nthis debt was a family matter, and not incurred in an arms-length transaction. Under the \ncircumstances, Applicant\u2019s blind trust in her son does not cast doubt on her current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns based on the debt alleged in the SOR. Accordingly, I \nconclude she has carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to continue her eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal finding on the allegation set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in his application\nof the mitigating conditions and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge found that Applicant had significant delinquent debt, arising in large measure from\nreal estate transactions.  Applicant had purchased a number of properties at tax sales, in 2001 owning\nfifteen.  However, he experienced financial problems associated with the properties, arising, inter\nalia, from poorly performed repairs and from Applicant\u2019s separation from his wife.  He attempted\nto sell some of them, but he was unable to find buyers who would pay the prices he desired.\nAlthough the Judge resolved some of the allegations in Applicant\u2019s favor, he concluded that\nApplicant had failed to meet his burden of persuasion as to six mortgage debts, totaling around $262,\n592.  He noted that these debts had been delinquent \u201cfor a substantial period of time.\u201d  Furthermore,\nApplicant \u201chas not paid anything to these six creditors in the past several years.\u201d  Decision at 13.\nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s financial situation reflected poorly upon his judgement.\nIn support of his appeal, Applicant points to decisions by the Hearing Office which he argues\nsupport his request for a favorable determination.  The Board gives due consideration to these cases.\nHowever, each case \u201cmust be decided upon its own merits.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3.  Moreover, Hearing\nOffice decisions are binding neither on other Hearing Office Judges nor on the Board.  See ISCR\nCase No. 06-24121 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008).  Applicant requests that the Board waive the one-\nyear bar on reapplication mandated by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.37.  The Board does not have authority to\nwaive provisions of the Directive.

On April 9, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to Applicant (GE 8), pursuant to Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, \nas amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended and modified.

The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended \nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant\u2019s clearance should be \ngranted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn April 22, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR (GE 9). On June 3, 2009, \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed. On June 3, 2009, the case was \nassigned to me. On June 4, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice (GE 7). Applicant \nwaived the 15-day notice requirement in the Directive (Transcript (Tr.) 18), and \nrequested that his hearing occur on June 11, 2009 (Tr. 18-19). Department Counsel \noffered six exhibits (Tr. 24; GE 1-6), and Applicant offered 24 exhibits (Tr. 26-36; AE \nA1-A14; AE B-L). Applicant did not object to my consideration of GE 1-6, and I admitted \nGE 1-6 into evidence (Tr. 24). Department Counsel did not object to my consideration of \nAE A1-A14 and AE B-L, and I admitted AE A1-A14 and AE B-L (Tr. 26-36). Additionally, \nI admitted the Notice of Hearing, SOR, and response to the SOR (GE 7-9). On June 13, \n2009, I received AE M-AM. On June 19, 2009, I received the transcript. On July 16, \n2009, I received AE AN-AQ. I admitted AE M-AQ after consideration of Department \nCounsel\u2019s clarifying comments, which went to the weight of the evidence, rather than to \ntheir admissibility.  \n \nOn July 22, 2009, I emailed a request for clarification through Department \nCounsel to Applicant with three attachments (AE AR). I sought an explanation for \nApplicant\u2019s comment, \u201csee attached paperwork,\u201d after subparagraphs on page 2 of \nApplicant\u2019s letter (AE M), because there was no documentation supporting his \nstatements about the amounts received on resale of his mortgaged properties.

I offered both \nparties an opportunity to submit additional evidence concerning whether Applicant owed \nor had the potential to owe additional funds on his foreclosed properties, and asked \nApplicant to provide information on the amounts he received, and when his mortgages \nwere financed or refinanced (AE AR).

He has been on a leave of absence from his \nemployment since April 30, 2009 without pay because of the security issue (Tr. 40, 41, \n116).  \n \nApplicant married in 1987 and divorced in 1997 (Tr. 46). His first wife receives \n25% of his retirement check, or about $150 a month (Tr. 47-48). His first wife \nautomatically receives her share of his retirement directly from the Defense Finance and \nAccounting Service (Tr. 48). He married in 2000 and divorced in March 2005 (Tr. 44). \nHis second wife is in a branch of the U.S. armed services, and she is currently on active \nduty (Tr. 55). His children from his second marriage are eight and six years of age (Tr. \n45). His children live with his second wife who is employed in a European country (Tr. \n45). He does not pay his second wife alimony; however, he does pay her $600 monthly \nin child support (Tr. 46). His child support payments are made through automatic \ndeductions and are current (Tr. 46). His annual salary is $73,122 (Tr. 42). \n \nApplicant started a real estate investment company in 1989 (Tr. 49). He \npurchased properties that were foreclosed or at tax sales in a particular Midwest city \n(Tr. 49-40). He chose a particular city because that is where his mother lived (Tr. 50). \nHe was not a real estate agent or broker (Tr. 52). Around 2000 to 2001, he owned as \nmany as 15 properties (Tr. 53).  \n \nAround 2000, Applicant had a series of problems with his properties. In 2000, a \nrepair man left the water running in a tub, which caused extensive water damage (Tr. \n54). He had paid the man $10,000 to work on several properties, and he eventually \nsued the repairman for $30,000 because of the repairman\u2019s damage to his property (Tr. \n54, 59). His mother was managing his properties, and she passed away in 2000 (Tr. \n54). He also had to evict some tenants (Tr. 54).    \n \nIn 2003, Applicant\u2019s wife was having an extramarital affair (Tr. 55). Applicant \nfound out about it and hit her (Tr. 55, 56). He was charged in state court with a \nmisdemeanor-level assault (Tr. 57).2 The court ordered one-year of probation and 16 \nweeks of domestic violence awareness classes (Tr. 112). He had to move out of their \nhouse (Tr. 55). Expenses increased because of the necessity to maintain two \nhouseholds (Tr. 55). A furnace went out, resulting in additional repair expenses (Tr. 56).  \n \nApplicant paid the mortgages on some of the properties and used the income \nfrom others to pay his living expenses (Tr. 62). The next month, he would pay other \nmortgages (Tr. 62). He decided to sell some properties; however, he was unable to find \n \n2 Applicant\u2019s SF-86 in Section 23f asked Applicant to disclose any such charges in the last seven \nyears (GE 1). He denied that he had been charged with any such charges (GE 1). However, there are no \nSOR allegations against Applicant under Guidelines E or J. Accordingly, I draw no adverse inference from \nthis incident itself, or from his failure to disclose this incident on his SF-86.    \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nbuyers, who would pay the prices he wanted (Tr. 63). When the divorce started, his wife \nwanted her share of the properties (Tr. 64). \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s employer pays $5,000 per year towards his education expenses, and \nhe receives $300 a quarter from the GI Bill (Tr. 39). His annual income before he \nbecame unemployed in April 2009 was $73,100 (Tr. 91). His monthly net income was \nabout $3,000 (Tr. 91). His current monthly expenses are as follows: rent ($600) and \nfood ($150). His car is paid off (Tr. 92). He does not have any credit cards (Tr. 92). He \nreduced his expenses substantially when he moved to a place with lower rent (rent was \nreduced from $1,500 a month to $600 a month) (Tr. 93). He has about $1,200 in his \nchecking account and $200 in his savings account (Tr. 93). He has about $25,000 in his \n401K account (Tr. 94). He is current on his taxes, and is not delinquent on any non-\nSOR debts (Tr. 95).  \n \nApplicant owns one property and it does not have a mortgage (Tr. 96). The \nproperty is not occupied (Tr. 97).     \n \nNon-mortgage SOR debts \n \nApplicant has seven unsecured (non-mortgage) SOR debts, totaling about \n$28,500.  Six are paid and the seventh debt cannot be resolved at this time because \nApplicant has insufficient income. Further details are provided in the next seven \nparagraphs.  \n \n  \nSOR \u00b6 1.b ($4,726)\u2014Paid. This debt to a credit card company was settled for \n$2,600 and paid on April 20, 2009 (Tr. 70; GE 9 at 8-9; AE A2). \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($8,145)\u2014Payment Plan. Applicant\u2019s debt to a credit card company \nwas transferred to the creditor\u2019s collection branch (Tr. 71). Applicant paid $2,209 in \nMarch 2009 (Tr. 71-73; AE A3; AE A4). He subsequently agreed to settle the debt for \n$5,000 (Tr. 73-75). However, he was unable to pay $5,000 because the creditor wanted \nthe whole amount in a single payment (Tr. 75). \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($3,125)\u2014Paid. Applicant\u2019s debt to a collection company was settled \nfor $1,400 and paid in September 2008 (Tr. 75-76; GE 9 at 12-13; AE A5; AE A11; AE \nA15).   \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.p ($7,477)\u2014Paid. Applicant\u2019s debt to a collection company was settled \nfor $2,700 and paid on October 6, 2008 (Tr. 85-86; GE 2 at 8; AE A11; AE 15). \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.q ($1,750)\u2014Paid. Applicant\u2019s debt to a store was settled for $1,703 and \npaid on September 12, 2008 (Tr. 87; AE A12). \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.u ($991)\u2014Paid. Applicant\u2019s SOR indicated this was a medical debt. \nActually, it was owed to a utility company (Tr. 88; GE 2 at 16). A letter from the creditor \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \ndated September 16, 2008, indicates Applicant paid this debt on September 12, 2008 \n(GE 9 at 36-37; AE A13). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.x ($2,357)\u2014Paid. Applicant\u2019s debt to a credit card company was settled \nand paid on October 6, 2008 (Tr. 90; AE A15).  \n \nMortgage-related SOR debts \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant owed 17 foreclosure-related debts to mortgage \ncompanies, totaling $677,691 as follows: (1) \u00b6 1.a ($48,872); (2) \u00b6 1.e ($30,430); (3) \u00b6 \n1.f ($35,069); (4) \u00b6 1.g ($35,052); (5) \u00b6 1.h ($61,584); (6) \u00b6 1.i ($34,728); (7) \u00b6 1.j \n($20,533); (8) \u00b6 1.k ($40,417); (9) \u00b6 1.l ($71,724); (10) \u00b6 1.m ($34,695); (11) \u00b6 1.n \n($49,112); (12) \u00b6 1.o ($25,200); (13) \u00b6 1.r ($27,450); (14) \u00b6 1.s ($35,550); (15) \u00b6 1.t \n($26,680); (16) \u00b6 1.v ($52,000); and (17) \u00b6 1.w ($47,595).  \n \nApplicant said he called his mortgage lenders and told them he could not make \nhis payments (Tr. 63). They suggested he attempt a \u201cshort sale to get rid of these \nproperties\u201d (Tr. 63). He advertised in the newspaper; however, the buyers \u201cwere really \ntrying to take them for, you know, pennies. And\u2014and I put too much time and too much \nmoney in them to let them go for, you know, pennies on the dollar\u201d (Tr. 64).  Eventually, \nhe called the lenders and suggested they take the properties through foreclosure (Tr. \n64). \n \nWhen he learned he needed additional information about the status of his \nmortgage or foreclosure accounts, he sent letters to the addresses in his credit reports \nasking for the status of his mortgage debts. He provided copies of letters sent in \nSeptember and October 2008 (GE 9 at 14-20, 25-30, 35). He also provided the letters \nhe sent in April 20, 2009, April 27, 2009, and June 13, 2009 to his mortgage creditors \n(AE: A1, A7, A8, A9, A10, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, W, V). Several creditors wrote Applicant \nasking for additional information, such as copies of his credit report, social security \nnumber, or his loan number to facilitate locating his account (GE 9 at 31; AE A14; AE \nAO). Another creditor wrote Applicant that the foreclosure would not be removed from \nhis credit report (GE 9 at 21-24). Applicant is waiting for the creditors to contact him and \nat that point he will attempt to negotiate a settlement of his debts (AE AT). He did not \nprovide information about what he paid to purchase the properties, except he indicated \nhe purchased one of them in 2000 for $7,000 (AE AT).  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($49,872)\u2014Not resolved. Applicant\u2019s July 4, 2007, credit report \nindicated a closed account, last activity on account in October 2001, high credit at the \nSOR amount with the description, \u201cACCOUNT PAID SATISFACTORILY\u201d and a zero \nbalance (GE 2 at 19). However, the same credit report has a judgment filed in \nSeptember 2004 from the same creditor for $49,872 (GE 2 at 3). Applicant\u2019s March 23, \n2009, credit report shows a \u201csecond mortgage\u201d description, high credit ($47,595) with \nnothing in the past due column (GE 6 at 4). Applicant provided a September 10, 2008, \nEquifax credit report showing a judgment on September 1, 2004, in the amount of \n$49,872 (AE L at 7). He also provided a September 10, 2008,  Experian credit report, \nshowing a secured loan to this creditor, opened (April 1, 2001) with a \u201cPaid \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nsatisfactorily\u201d description (AE L at 50). Applicant sent letters to the creditor asking for \ninformation about the status of his debt (AE A1; AE R; Tr. 66-67). He provided a \nreference number on the credit report and not the account number or case number \n(compare GE 2 at 3, AE L at 7 and AE L at 50). He did not send the letters to the \naddress listed in his September 10, 2008, credit report (AE L at 50). He did not receive \na reply. Applicant opined that the property was sold for the amount he owed the lender \n(Tr. 70).  He did not provide documentation showing the amount paid at the foreclosure \nsale, or the amount the lender received. After the hearing, I explained in an email to \nApplicant why I believed this debt was unresolved and asked Applicant to provide \nadditional information about the status of this debt (AE AR). On August 3, 2009, \nApplicant replied to my email; however, his response did not include any significant new \ninformation or describe any additional actions to obtain additional information about this \ndebt\u2019s status (AE AT).    \n   \n SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e ($30,430), 1.f ($35,069) and 1.g ($35,052)-Resolved. Applicant \nowed these three mortgage debts to the same creditor (Tr. 76-77). The creditor \nexplained that four of Applicant\u2019s properties went to foreclosure sales and were sold in \n2005 (AE AG) and stated, \u201cThis resulted in a zero balance owed on [these accounts] \nand ended the business relationship between [Applicant and the creditor].\u201d (AE AG).  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h ($61,584)\u2014Resolved. Applicant\u2019s July 4, 2007, credit report showed \na last activity on account in August 2005, indicating a balance of $61,584, a past due \namount of $8,139 and \u201cFORECLOSURE REDEEMED . . . GRANTOR RECLAIMED \nCOLLATERAL TO SETTLE DEFAULTED MORTGAGE\u201d (GE 2 at 6). Applicant wrote \nletters to the lender asking for additional information on April 20, 2009, and June 13, \n2009 (Tr. 77-78; AE A7; AE Q). The creditor did not respond to Applicant\u2019s request for \ninformation (Tr. 78). \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i ($34,728) and 1.j ($20,533)\u2014Not resolved. Applicant owed these \ntwo mortgage debts to the same creditor (Tr. 79-80). His July 4, 2007, credit report \nshowed foreclosure filings on the two accounts in the SOR amounts, occurring in \nAugust and September 2004 with an \u201cUNKNOWN\u201d disposition (GE 2 at 50). He wrote \nletters to the lender asking for additional information on April 20, 2009, and June 13, \n2009 (Tr. 79-81; AE A8; AE W). The creditor did not respond to Applicant\u2019s request for \ninformation (Tr. 78). On June 13, 2009, he submitted a letter stating the SOR \u00b6 1.i \nproperty was sold without listing the sales price and the second property was sold for \n$73,900 (AE M at 2); however, he did not provide documentation to corroborate his \ncontention. After the hearing, I explained in an email to Applicant why I believed this \ndebt was unresolved and asked Applicant to provide additional information about the \nstatus of this debt (AE AR). On August 3, 2009, Applicant replied to my email; however, \nhis response did not include any significant new information or describe any additional \nactions to obtain additional information about this debt\u2019s status (AE AT).    \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k ($40,417)\u2014Not resolved. Applicant\u2019s July 4, 2007, credit report \nshowed the most recent information on his account as being filed in November 2004 \nwith the account being in foreclosure status (GE 2 at 3). In November 2004, he owed \n$40,417 (GE 2 at 3). Applicant wrote letters to the lender asking for additional \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \ninformation on April 20, 2009, and June 13, 2009 (Tr. 82-83; AE U). He did not receive a \nreply from the creditor. On June 13, 2009, he submitted a letter stating the SOR \u00b6 1.k \nproperty was sold for $62,000 (AE M at 2); however, he did not provide documentation \nto corroborate his contention. After the hearing, I explained in an email to Applicant why \nI believed this debt was unresolved and asked Applicant to provide additional \ninformation about the status and planned resolution of this debt (AE AR). On August 3, \n2009, Applicant replied to my email; however, his response did not include any \nsignificant new information or describe any additional actions to obtain additional \ninformation about this debt\u2019s status (AE AT). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l ($71,724)\u2014Not resolved. Applicant\u2019s July 4, 2007, credit report \nshowed the most recent information on his account as being filed in March 2005 with \nthe account being in foreclosure status (GE 2 at 3, 16). In November 2004, he owed \n$71,724 (GE 2 at 3, 16). It also showed a zero balance and account transferred, paid or \nsold (Tr. 82; GE 2 at 16). His September 10, 2008, credit report also showed a \nforeclosure on March 28, 2005, filed in the county court (AE L at 6). Applicant wrote \nletters to the lender asking for additional information on April 20, 2009, and June 13, \n2009 (Tr. 82-83; AE A9; AE V). The post office returned the letter he sent to the creditor \nwith a notation from the post office indicating he used an incorrect address (Tr. 83; AE \nA9). On June 13, 2009, he submitted a letter stating the SOR \u00b6 1.l property was sold for \nan unknown price (AE M at 2); however, he did not provide documentation to \ncorroborate his contention.  After the hearing, I explained in an email to Applicant why I \nbelieved this debt was unresolved and asked Applicant to provide additional information \nabout the status and planned resolution of this debt (AE AR). On August 3, 2009, \nApplicant replied to my email, indicating he had not taken any additional action to \ndetermine the status of this debt (AE AT). He said that the property was sold on March \n15, 2002, and cited to a tax record (AE AR at attachment L). See AE AT. The tax record \nindicated the owner on December 12, 2008, is the same owner that acquired the \nproperty on March 15, 2002 (AE AR at attachment L). Applicant did not provide \ndocumentation showing the property described in AE AR at attachment L was the same \nproperty encumbered by the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.l. Applicant stated he still owned the \nproperty encumbered by the SOR \u00b6 1.l debt in the 2004 to 2005 timeframe (AE AR). As \nsuch, there are too many unanswered questions to determine that this debt is resolved.  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m ($34,695), 1.n ($49,112) and 1.o ($25,200)\u2014Resolved. Applicant \nowed these three mortgage debts to the same creditor (Tr. 83).

In September \n2008, Applicant wrote the creditor requesting information on the mortgage and on \nSeptember 30, 2008, Applicant received a letter from the creditor (Tr. 84; GE 9 at 31). \nThe letter is unclear about the status of Applicant\u2019s accounts (GE 9 at 31). Applicant did \nnot believe he owed anything to the creditor (Tr. 85). On June 13, 2009, he submitted a \nletter stating the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m, 1.n and 1.o properties were sold for: price unknown \n(1.m); $51,400 (1.n); and $32,760 (1.o).

I conclude his July \n2007 credit report, indicating the creditor reclaimed the property to settle this debt, \nrelieves Applicant of liability for this debt. I find \u201cFor Applicant\u201d in the Formal Findings \nsection of this decision. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.w ($47,595)\u2014Not Resolved. Applicant\u2019s July 4, 2007, credit report \nshowed a last activity on account in May 2004, indicating the SOR amount in the HIGH \nCREDIT column, and a zero amount in the BALANCE column. This credit report \nindicated the account pertained to a real estate mortgage that was now closed because \nthe account was transferred (GE 2 at 19). Applicant contacted the creditor on June 13, \n2009, to request information on the status of this debt (Tr. 90; AE T). On July 18, 1009, \nthe creditor responded with a request for a valid mortgage number (AE AO). After the \nhearing, I explained in an email to Applicant why I believed this debt was unresolved \nand asked Applicant to provide additional information about the status and planned \nresolution of this debt (AE AR). On August 3, 2009, Applicant replied to my email; \nhowever, his response did not include any significant new information or describe \nadditional actions to obtain additional information about this debt\u2019s status (AE AT). \nApplicant states he still owned the property encumbered by the SOR \u00b6 1.w debt in the \n2004 to 2005 timeframe (AE AR). As such, there are too many unanswered questions to \ndetermine that this debt is resolved.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nApplicant promised to pay his creditors if he owed them anything (Tr. 79). He \ndoes not intend to invest in real estate in the future (Tr. 97). He said he did not file for \nbankruptcy because he believed he was responsible for repaying his creditors (Tr. 97). \nHis second divorce and the real estate downturn caused his financial problems (Tr. 98). \nI held the record open after the hearing because Applicant promised to check real \nestate records to determine whether he owed any additional money to his creditors (Tr. \n99-110). I also suggested he obtain some documentation from character references or \nhis employers (Tr. 99). He completed an electronic check of the property records (AE X; \nAE Y; AE Z). After August 1, 2009, he did not provide any additional property records or \ncharacter references. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcern is under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the \nsecurity concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d; and \n\u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. \nBd. Oct. 26, 2006) provides, \u201cApplicant\u2019s credit report was sufficient to establish the \nGovernment\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant had  .  .  . delinquent [SOR] debts that are \nof security concern.\u201d Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is also documented in his \nSOR response, his oral statement at his hearing, and the documentation he submitted. \nHe failed to ensure his creditors were paid as agreed. The government established the \ndisqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). Further inquiry about the applicability \nof mitigating conditions is required. \n  \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n   \nFive mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-20(e) are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because he \ndid not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent debts. His \ndelinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s \njurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). He receives partial credit because his \ndelinquent debts \u201coccurred under such circumstances that [they are] unlikely to recur.\u201d \nHowever, the problem of six large delinquent mortgage debts totaling about $262,592 is \nunresolved. Applicant admitted he borrowed the money on those six mortgages; \nhowever, he failed to provide sufficient documentation to establish the status or \nresolution of these six accounts. Applicant has about $262,592 in unresolved, \ndelinquent debt, and this substantial unresolved debt continues to \u201ccast doubt on [his] \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  \n \nApplicant receives partial credit under AG \u00b6 20(b) because his financial problems \ninitially resulted from the real estate downturn. Damage to his property from a \nhandyman, the death of his mother (who was acting as his agent on his real estate \ninvestments), problems with his tenants, maintenance issues, and his second divorce \ncontributed to his financial woes. In April 2009, he became unemployed. Despite these \nissues, he does not receive full mitigating credit because he did not establish that he \nacted responsibly under the circumstances.3   \n \n3\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                                                            \nAG \u00b6 20(c) partially applies. Applicant received financial counseling as part of his \nself-education in real estate and financial matters. It is clear from his statements that he \nis intelligent and has an above average understanding of budgeting and financial \nissues. Additional financial counseling is unnecessary because of Applicant\u2019s \nbackground and experience. However, there are not \u201cclear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control\u201d because six debts totaling about $262,592 remain \nunresolved. He has also established some, but not full mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d), \nbecause he showed some good faith4 in the payment of his six non-mortgage related \nSOR debts and by contacting some mortgage-related SOR creditors and obtaining \nreleases of his liability. Applicant did not provide documentation contesting the validity \nof any debts, and AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply.  \n \nIn sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts \nsooner to resolve his delinquent debts. In the last year, his efforts have been insufficient \nin regard to six delinquent mortgage debts, totaling about $262,592. I gave Applicant \nadditional time after his hearing to obtain more information about these six mortgage \ndebts. Moreover, I asked him to provide information about the price to purchase these \nproperties because that information would provide an indication about whether he was \nacting responsibly when he refinanced or obtained second mortgages and whether he \nborrowed excessively. His response on August 3, 2009, did not provide additional, \nmeaningful assistance in resolving the status of his six delinquent mortgage debts, \ntotaling about $262,592. He did not provide sufficient information about what he paid for \nthe properties and the amounts financed on his properties. He indicated he used some \nof the funds from his real estate investments for living expenses; however, he did not \nprovide sufficient information about his finances to establish his financial responsibility.  \n \n \n \n \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \n \n4The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n\n \n13 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n  \n \nApplicant provided some important mitigating evidence under the whole person \nconcept. There is no evidence of any security violation(s). He is generally a law-abiding \ncitizen. His current financial problems were partially caused by some factors somewhat \nbeyond his control: (1) the real estate downturn; (2) damage to his property from a \nhandyman; (3) the death of his mother (who was acting as his agent on his real estate \ninvestments); (4) problems with tenants; (5) maintenance issues on his properties; (6) \nhis divorce; and (7) his unemployment beginning in April 2009. He paid or adequately \nresolved 18 of 24 SOR debts.    \n \nApplicant has achieved some important educational and employment goals, \ndemonstrating his self-discipline, responsibility and dedication. He graduated from high \nschool. He has a bachelors degree and earned some credits towards his masters \ndegree.  He honorably retired in the grade of E-6 after 20 years of service. His \nemployment history and contributions to a defense contractor speak well for his \ncharacter. He understands how to budget and what he needs to do to establish his \nfinancial responsibility. Applicant has demonstrated his loyalty, patriotism and \ntrustworthiness through his service to the Department of Defense as a contractor and \non active duty. These factors, especially his past government service, show substantial \nresponsibility.  \n \nThe evidence under the whole person concept against mitigating Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial conduct is more substantial. Applicant\u2019s six mortgage debts have been \ndelinquent for a substantial period of time. He did not meet his evidentiary burden when \nhe failed to establish the status of six of his delinquent mortgage debts. He currently has \na total of six delinquent mortgage debts, totaling about $262,592. He has not paid \n\n \n14 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nanything to these six creditors in the past several years. He noted that he had a $25,000 \nretirement account, has used his real estate investments to fund his living expenses, \nand had one real estate property that was mortgage free. It is possible that the creditors \naccepted a deed in lieu of foreclosure on several of the six unresolved mortgages and \nhis liability was released. Ultimately, he did not establish that he acted with sufficient \neffort and self-discipline to resolve his six delinquent mortgage debts and to better \ndocument his remedial efforts. All the factors considered together show too much \nfinancial irresponsibility and lack of judgment. His history of delinquent debt raises \nunmitigated security concerns.   \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not sufficiently \nmitigated financial considerations security concerns.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not fully mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nPARAGRAPH 1, GUIDELINE F:   \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b to 1.h: \n For Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i to 1.l:  \nAgainst Applicant  \nSubparagraphs 1.m to 1.v: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.w and 1.x: \n Against Applicant \n \n \n  \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

Applicant is a 27-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began working for his current employer in May 2006, while he was a senior in college. He has never been legally married, but he has joint custody of a nine-year-old son who was born during a 5-year common-law marriage (GX 6 at 8). He has four brothers and two sisters. He has never held a final security clearance, but he has held an interim clearance while working for his current employer (AX A at 3). Applicant graduated from high school in 2000 and began attending college (GX 5 at 11-12), but he apparently has not yet completed his degree requirements for a bachelor\u2019s degree in engineering (AX A at 3). He worked part-time at various jobs from January 1998 to August 1998, from January 2002 to May 2004, and from July 2005 to May 2006, when he was hired by his current employer (GX 5 at 13-18). In September 1999, when Applicant was 16 years old, he was arrested while driving a stolen car. He was with five friends in the stolen car when he was stopped by police, and he told the police that his friends were not involved in the theft (GX 7 at 90).

On \nOctober 7, 2009, a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was sent to \nApplicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to \nrefute, extenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s evidence. Applicant received the FORM \non October 14, 2009, and responded on November 13, 2009. His response to the \nFORM was admitted in evidence as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX A), without objection. The \ncase was assigned to me on December 14, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR. His \nadmissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 27-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began working \nfor his current employer in May 2006, while he was a senior in college. He has never \nbeen legally married, but he has joint custody of a nine-year-old son who was born \nduring a 5-year common-law marriage (GX 6 at 8). He has four brothers and two sisters. \nHe has never held a final security clearance, but he has held an interim clearance while \nworking for his current employer (AX A at 3).  \n \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in 2000 and began attending college (GX 5 \nat 11-12), but he apparently has not yet completed his degree requirements for a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in engineering (AX A at 3). He worked part-time at various jobs from \nJanuary 1998 to August 1998, from January 2002 to May 2004, and from July 2005 to \nMay 2006, when he was hired by his current employer (GX 5 at 13-18). \n  \n \nIn September 1999, when Applicant was 16 years old, he was arrested while \ndriving a stolen car. He was with five friends in the stolen car when he was stopped by \npolice, and he told the police that his friends were not involved in the theft (GX 7 at 90). \nThe evidence of the charges filed against him is conflicting. The police records reflect \nthat he was charged with aggravated motor vehicle theft and \u201ctheft by receiving\u201d (GX 7 \nat 84-91), but the court records reflect that he was charged with aggravated motor \nvehicle theft and theft of rental property. The court records also reflect that the charge of \naggravated motor vehicle theft was dismissed and that he pleaded guilty to theft of \nrental property (GX 7 at 25). He was sentenced to 30 days in juvenile detention \n(suspended), unsupervised probation for 12 months, and fines and restitution of $875 \n(GX 7 at 25). He worked at a fast food restaurant to pay the fines and restitution (AX A \nat 1).  \n \n \nIn November 2004, Applicant and several family members, including his son and \nnephew, gathered in his apartment for a birthday celebration. Neighbors on the floor \nbelow them complained to police about loud noise and the sounds of constant \nmovement, as they had done two or three times previously (GX 7 at 12). Applicant was \ncited for a nuisance offense. He elected to pay a $50 fine rather than demand a trial and \ntake time away from school and work (AX A at 2. He and his brothers negotiated with \nthe landlord to terminate the lease early, and they moved elsewhere (GX 7 at 13). \n\n \n3\n \nIn January 2007, Applicant, his siblings, and several of their spouses went to a \nrestaurant for dinner. Several siblings, but not Applicant, had been consuming alcohol. \nThey became upset about the service when they waited for more than an hour for their \nfood and the wrong food was served. Some of Applicant\u2019s party directed vulgar \nlanguage and ethnic slurs toward the staff and the manager, who was of Hispanic \norigin. Applicant\u2019s party started to leave the restaurant but was willing to pay only for the \nfood they had received instead of everything they had ordered (GX 7 at 77-78). \nAccording to Applicant, the restaurant manager directed a racial slur toward his group, \nall of whom are of Asian descent. At that point, Applicant either pushed or punched the \nmanager (GX 7 at 17, 60, 66, 75, 78-79). After the police arrived at the restaurant, they \nadministered two breathalyzer tests to Applicant, both of which registered 0.00 (GX 7 at \n17). \n \nApplicant was charged with misdemeanor battery. He pleaded guilty and was \nplaced on supervised probation for 12 months, ordered to attend a conflict management \nclass, and ordered to undergo alcohol evaluation (GX 7 at 23). According to Applicant, \nhis probation officer did not require the alcohol evaluation because he had not been \ndrinking on the night of the incident and did not have any alcohol-related or drug-related \nincidents in his past (AX A at 2). \n \n \nIn January 2008, Applicant was at a bar with a group of friends. One of the \ngroup, apparently intoxicated, was involved in an incident on the dance floor that began \nwith an apparently accidental bumping and progressed to what was described by a \nwitness as \u201cstaring at [another man] in a threatening manner\u201d and a hand gesture of \nunknown meaning. Applicant\u2019s friend was asked to leave the premises but refused. His  \nfriend was taken into custody, removed from the premises, and placed in a police patrol \ncar. Several of Applicant\u2019s group gathered around and began shouting at the police, \nsome of them using vulgar language (GX 7 at 32). They were ordered by police to leave \nthe premises (GX 7 at 28).  \n \nApplicant was not identified as one of those who were shouting at the police, but \nhe was identified as one who refused to leave when ordered (GX 7 at 33). In an \ninterview with a security investigator, he stated that he complied with the police directive \nby getting into one of the cars driven by members of the group. He was sitting in the \npassenger seat when he was directed by the police to get out of the car. He was cited \nfor trespassing and obstruction of a police officer, and released on the scene (GX 7 at \n33, 41). According to Applicant, he asked the police officer why he was being cited, and \nthe officer responded that he had not listened to the police (GX 6 at 6; AX A at 3).  \n \nApplicant pleaded not guilty to both offenses. He was acquitted of trespassing \nbut convicted of obstruction. He told the security investigator he believed his conviction \nof obstruction was based on mistaken identification, and that he was convicted for the \nactions of one of his brothers (GX 7 at 6). He was sentenced to supervised probation for \n12 months and ordered to undergo alcohol evaluation, obtain alcohol counseling, and \nattend conflict management classes (GX 7 at 23).  \n\n \n4\nApplicant underwent a drug and alcohol evaluation in September 2008, and the \nevaluator concluded there was insufficient evidence to regard him as a candidate for \ntreatment. As a precautionary measure, the evaluator recommended random breath \ntests twice a week for three months (GX 6 at 8). He completed an anger management \nseminar in October 2008 (GX 6 at 9) \n \nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant insisted he had done nothing wrong \nduring the January 2008 incident, but he acknowledged that he was found guilty of \nobstructing a police officer. He also stated he was a stronger and wiser person as a \nresult of the experience, and he is now more cautious when going out in large groups \n(AX A at 3). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n\n \n5\n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant was arrested for trespassing and obstructing a police \nofficer, and convicted of the latter offense (SOR \u00b6 1.a); he was arrested and convicted \nof battery (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and he paid a fine for causing an unlawful nuisance (SOR \u00b6 1.c). \nIt also alleges he was arrested as a juvenile for aggravated motor vehicle theft and theft \nof rental property, and he was convicted of theft of rental property (SOR 1.d). The \nconcern raised by criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30 as follows: \u201cCriminal activity \ncreates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very \nnature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules \nand regulations.\u201d \n \nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include \n\u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d and \u201callegation or admission of \ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally \nprosecuted, or convicted.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c). Applicant\u2019s criminal record raises both \ndisqualifying conditions, shifting the burden to him evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government. See \nISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nTwo mitigating conditions, AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d), are relevant. None of the other \nenumerated mitigating conditions under this guideline apply to this case.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 32(a), security concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by \nevidence that \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \n\n \n6\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s \njuvenile felony conviction in 1999 was the beginning of a pattern of criminal conduct in \nwhich he either succumbed to peer pressure or was swept along in a boisterous, unruly \ngroup. None of the incidents happened under unusual circumstances. The incidents, \nconsidered together, cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. I conclude AG \u00b6 32(a) is not established. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 32(d), security concerns based on criminal conduct also may be \nmitigated if \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the \npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job \ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement.\u201d Applicant\u2019s latest conviction is recent. Although he has worked for his \ncurrent employer for almost four years, he presented no evidence of his performance at \nwork. He has expressed remorse for some of his offenses in his written responses, but \nhe has denied culpability for the nuisance violation and the January 2008 incident. My \nability to judge his sincerity and credibility is limited because he did not request a \nhearing. I conclude AG \u00b6 32(d) is not established. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline J in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a young man with a gregarious family. He has worked hard since \nhigh school. He has held an interim clearance with his current employer. He \nacknowledged in his response to the FORM that he needs to be more cautious in a \nlarge group. It is too soon to tell whether he will implement that wisdom at future social \nevents. He has not yet demonstrated the maturity and good judgment expected of a \n\n \n7\nperson entrusted with classified information. See Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E.3.1.17 through E.3.1.40 \n(reconsideration of a denial of a security clearance authorized after one year).  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline J, \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, and mindful of my \nobligation to resolve doubtful cases in favor of national security, I conclude Applicant \nhas not mitigated the security concerns based on criminal conduct. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR, as required by \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Clearance is denied.\nOn December 5, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuidelines G and E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 2, 2008, and requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to me on February 12, 2009. On February 17, 2009 a Notice of\nHearing was issued originally scheduling the case for March 2, 2009. The hearing was\ncontinued because of inclement weather, and rescheduled for April 6, 2009. It was then\nApril 30, 2009\n\n2\nheld as scheduled. At the hearing, I received six government exhibits and Applicant\u2019s\ntestimony. The transcript was received on April 15, 2009.\nRulings of Procedure and Evidence\nI. I granted department counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw SOR subparagraphs 1.k\nand 1.m. \n2. SOR subparagraph 1.g, alleging a debt to a creditor identified only as \u201ca\nmedical account,\u201d is vague and overbroad. Although SORs do not need to be drafted\nwith the specificity of criminal pleadings, they must, at minimum, be drafted with enough\nspecificity to enable applicants to prepare a response. SOR subparagraph 1.g does not\nmeet this threshold, therefore I will not consider it.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 59-year-old married man with three adult children. He is a veteran\nof the U.S. Marine Corps where he served from 1969 through 1979. He was honorably\ndischarged. While in the Marines, he served a tour of duty in Vietnam.\nApplicant has a GED. In 1994, he attended vocational school, earning a\nmechanical drafting certificate (Exhibit 1 at 9). He has spent approximately the past 20\nyears working for various defense contractors in the mechanical drafting field (Tr. 18).\nHe has been working for his current employer since February 2008 (Exhibit 1 at 9).\nAppellant owes creditors approximately $50,000 of debt in various stages of\ndelinquency. He accrued the majority of the delinquencies during the past ten years. \nSOR subparagraphs 1.a through 1.c are credit cards with balances ranging from\n$150 to $360 (Exhibit 3 at 1-2). Each is one month behind with amounts due ranging\nfrom $43 to $46 (Id.). The credit cards listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.d and 1.e,\ncollectively totalling approximately $11,600, have been charged off (Exhibit 3 at 2). SOR\nsubparagraphs 1.f and 1.h, collectively totalling $23,500, are in collection status (Exhibit\n3 at 3). SOR subparagraph 1.i is the deficiency remaining from an automobile\nrepossessed in 2004 (Id.). SOR subparagraph 1. j, is Applicant\u2019s mortgage payment,\nwhich is overdue in the amount of $1,462 (Answer).\nApplicant failed to pay his state income taxes between 1988 and 1993 (Tr. 50).\nThis led to the imposition of three tax liens between 1991 and 1996. Applicant has\nsatisfied two of them (Exhibits 4-5). One, in the amount of $10,685, remains\noutstanding. \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to health problems stemming from a\nwork-related injury in 1991 and a number of chronic ailments experienced within the\npast ten years (Tr. 18). Also, he contends that several periods of unemployment have\nexacerbated his financial difficulties, including a one-year period of underemployment in\n\n3\n2004, and a four month unemployment period between November 2007 and February\n2008 (Exhibit 1 at 10).\nIn June 2008, Applicant met with a security clearance investigator. In response to\nquestions about his finances, he promised to contact the creditors and begin making\npayment arrangements (Exhibit 6 at 1). To date, he has not done so.\nApplicant earns approximately $52,000 per year. His wife works part-time at a\nbank and earns $10 per hour. He does not maintain a budget. Although he has not\nsought financial counseling, he and his wife have discussed filing for bankruptcy\nprotection.\nApplicant disclosed neither the 2004 automobile repossession, nor the delinquent\ndebts as required on his 2008 security clearance application. He contends that the\nrepossession \u201cslipped his mind\u201d (Tr. 54). As for the other financial questions, he was\naware of his indebtedness when he completed the security clearance application, but\ndid not list them because he \u201cneeded the job\u201d (Tr. 56).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\n\n4\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information\u201d\n(AG \u00b6 18). Applicant\u2019s longstanding delinquencies trigger the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a),\n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations.\u201d\nI also considered AG \u00b6 19(g), \u201cfailure to file annual Federal, state, or local income\ntax returns as required, or the fraudulent filing of the same,\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s\nincome tax difficulties. Although record evidence establishes that he did not pay his\nincome taxes timely between 1988 and 1993, there is no record evidence that\nestablishes that he failed to file his income tax returns. AG \u00b6 19(c) does not apply.\nI have considered the mitigating conditions and conclude none apply. Despite\npromising a security clearance investigator that he was going to begin organizing and\nsatisfying his debts, he failed to do so. Also, he has neither sought financial counseling\nnor developed a budget. Although his health and employment problems could\nconceivably trigger the application of AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . , and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances,\u201d he failed to present any evidence establishing\nthat he acted responsibly under the circumstances.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation\u201d (AG \u00b6 15). Applicant\u2019s omission of pertinent financial information from his\nsecurity clearance application raises the issue of whether AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities,\u201d applies.\nApplicant had a duty to provide candid, truthful responses on his security\nclearance application. His concealment of relevant, material information is not mitigated\nby his concern that he may not have gotten the job if he had disclosed his financial\ndelinquencies, as required on his security clearance application (see generally, DISCR\nOSD NO. 89-1586 (App. Bd. October 26, 1990)). His intentional omission of delinquent\ndebts from the security clearance application undermines the credibility of his contention\n\n5\nthat he did not list the 2004 automobile repossession because he forgot about it. AG \u00b6\n16(a) applies without mitigation.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies were caused partially by his history of health\nproblems and job instability. However, he failed to follow through on a promise to begin\nsatisfying them. Currently, all of the SOR delinquencies remain outstanding. In light of\nthis broken promise and his SOR falsifications, any future promises to pay the\ndelinquencies have limited probative value. Upon considering the disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions together with the whole person concept, I conclude Applicant has\nnot mitigated the Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct security concerns.\nClearance is denied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.h -1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nWITHDRAWN\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nWITHDRAWN\n\n6\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

He worked for federal contractors from November 2003 to July 2006, when he left his job under unfavorable circumstances. He was unemployed from July to October 2006. He worked for another federal contractor from October 2006 to June 2007. He has worked for his current employer since July 2007. Applicant was married in February 1987 and divorced in April 1989.

Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) on November 5, 2007. On February 17, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its \npreliminary decision to deny his application, citing security concerns under Guidelines F \nand E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  \n \nAugust 31, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on March 3, 2009, and answered it on April 25, \n2009. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on June 30, 2009, and the case was \nassigned to an administrative judge on July 1, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing \non July 2, 2009, scheduling the hearing for July 30, 2009. Applicant requested a \ncontinuance until August 3, 2009, to enable his wife to attend the hearing. The case was \nreassigned to me on July 7, 2009, and the hearing was rescheduled for August 3, 2009. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 9 were \nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit (AX) A, which was admitted without objection. The record closed upon \nadjournment of the hearing. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on August 11, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b \nand 1.d-1.j. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my \nfindings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old information assurance analyst employed by a federal \ncontractor. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from August 1983 to October \n2003, retiring as a staff sergeant (pay grade E-6). He received a security clearance in \n1986, while on active duty (Tr. 6, 23). He worked for federal contractors from November \n2003 to July 2006, when he left his job under unfavorable circumstances. He was \nunemployed from July to October 2006. He worked for another federal contractor from \nOctober 2006 to June 2007. He has worked for his current employer since July 2007.  \n \n \nApplicant was married in February 1987 and divorced in April 1989. He remarried \nin May 1993. He has a 20-year-old stepson and a 16-year-old daughter. His stepson will \nbegin college in the fall of 2009.  \n \n \nIn February 2006, while working for a former employer, Applicant received an \nEmployee of the Quarter award (Tr. 87; Answer to SOR). In May 2006, he was \ncounseled in writing for coming to work without his Common Access Card (CAC) (GX 9 \nat 10). The formal counseling occurred after he came to work without his CAC for the \nthird time (Tr. 67). The written counseling form states he was verbally counseled after \nhe forgot his CAC for the first time.  \n \nIn April 2008, during an interview by a security investigator, Applicant stated he \ndid not have \u201cany problems, reprimands, or incidents,\u201d leading up to his termination in \nJuly 2006 (GX 3 at 20). In his response to DOHA interrogatories dated December 18, \n2008, he answered \u201cno\u201d to the question, \u201cOther than allegations which led to your \nseparation from [your former employer], were you ever counseled or reprimanded \nverbally or in writing by [your former employer]?\u201d At the hearing, he testified he did not \ndisclose his counseling in May 2006 because he did not remember it (Tr. 68). \n \n \nIn July 2006, Applicant was accused by a female co-worker of touching her \ninappropriately. According to the co-worker, Applicant came up behind her, rubbed her \n\n \n3 \n \n \nleg, shoulders, face, and hips several times on July 11, 2006. He held a necklace she \nwas wearing and placed his hand over her breast area. He invited her to go with him to \nan office on an upper floor to see the view. She declined, telling him that she needed to \nremain at her place of duty. Later in the day, Applicant gave her a note inviting her to \nmeet him on the upper floor. She gave the note to their supervisor (GX 9 at 5-7). Their \nimmediate supervisor and the company\u2019s regional director found the woman\u2019s \nallegations to be true, and Applicant was terminated for sexual harassment (GX 9 at 3).  \n \nDuring his interview with the security investigator in April 2008, Applicant denied \ntouching the woman inappropriately or sexually harassing her (GX 3 at 20). At the \nhearing, he again denied touching the woman sexually (Tr. 71-72, 86). He testified that \nhe and his co-workers, including the woman who complained, sometimes touched each \nother by pushing, bumping, or similar horseplay, but there was never any sexual \ntouching (Tr. 38, 72-73, 83-85). \n \n \nApplicant answered \u201cyes\u201d to question 22 on his e-QIP (GX 1 at 32), asking him if \nany of the following had happened to him during the past seven years: \n \n1. Fired from a job. \n2. Quit a job after being told you\u2019d be fired.  \n3. Left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of misconduct.  \n4. Left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of unsatisfactory \nperformance. \n5. Left a job for other reasons under unfavorable circumstances.  \n \nIn the section explaining his answer, he listed his severance type as \u201cLeft a job for other \nreasons under unfavorable circumstances.\u201d He listed the reason for his severance as, \n\u201cThere was an altercation with a co-worker.\u201d  \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant admitted he knew he had been terminated. When asked \nwhy he did not say he was fired, he responded, \u201cBecause my understanding of that \nquestion was that I did leave under \u2013 that I left that job under unfavorable actions.\u201d He \nwas not asked and did not explain why he stated on his e-QIP that he was terminated \nbecause of an altercation with a co-worker. \n \n \nApplicant purchased a new home in 2006, intending to sell the home he bought \nwhile on active duty. He was unable to sell his old home and decided to rent it, but it \ntook eight months to find a tenant. While trying to find a tenant, he was terminated for \nsexual harassment. The combination of paying for two homes and being unemployed \ndrained him financially (Tr. 36). He borrowed $20,000 from his credit union for living \nexpenses during his period of unemployment (Tr. 59-60). As of the date of the hearing, \nhe had an offer to buy his old home in a short sale. He testified he would surrender the \nhome to the bank if the short sale was not completed (Tr. 61-62).  \n \n \nIn February 2009, before receiving the SOR, Applicant and his spouse contacted \na bankruptcy attorney (Answer to SOR at 5). On April 29, 2009, they filed a petition for \n\n \n4 \n \n \nChapter 13 bankruptcy (GX 8). All creditors except those alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.e \nare specifically listed in the bankruptcy petition. Applicant and his spouse received \nbudget counseling as part of the Chapter 13 process (Tr. 37). They are obligated to pay \n$1,600 per month on the debts included in the bankruptcy (Tr. 63-64).  \n \n \nApplicant submitted a current family budget reflecting total family income of \n$10,114 per month and expenses of $10,037, leaving a monthly remainder of $77. The \nmonthly expenses include the mortgage payments on their residence and payments to \nthe bankruptcy trustee (AX A). As of the date of the hearing, Applicant and his spouse \nhad made three monthly payments to the trustee (Tr. 64).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe SOR alleges 10 delinquent debts totaling about $179,038. The concern \nunder this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \nAn individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in \nillegal acts to generate funds. \n \n \nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant. AG \u00b6 19(a) is \nraised by an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised by \u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised by \u201cconsistent \nspending beyond one=s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, \nsignificant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s financial history raises AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (e), shifting the burden to him to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to \nthe government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \n\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(a). This mitigating \n\n \n6 \n \n \ncondition is not established because Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are ongoing, \nnumerous, and did not arise from circumstances that are unlikely to recur.  \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u2018the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person=s \ncontrol and responsible conduct, must be established. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s loss of employment was due to his own misconduct and was within \nhis control, but the downturn in the housing market was a circumstance beyond his \ncontrol. After eight months, he found a tenant for his previous residence. He borrowed \nmoney from his credit union until he found new employment. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(b) is \npartially established, to the extent that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were due to his \ninability to sell or rent his former residence. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(c). Applicant \nand his spouse received the counseling required by the bankruptcy court and have \ntaken significant first steps toward resolving their debts. It is not clear from the record \nwhether the delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.e are included in the \nbankruptcy. Even if they are not included, the Chapter 13 bankruptcy is a significant \nstep toward resolution of Applicant\u2019s financial problems. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(c) is \nestablished. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 \nWL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). An applicant is not required, as a matter of \nlaw, to establish resolution of each and every debt alleged in the SOR. See ADP Case \nNo. 06-18900 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2008). An applicant need only establish a plan to \nresolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. ISCR \nCase No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). There also is no requirement that \nan applicant make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. Id. Applicant and his spouse \nhave a plan to resolve their problems, and they have taken significant steps to \nimplement it. They both are gainfully employed, and they have adopted a realistic \nbudget that includes payments under their Chapter 13 bankruptcy. I conclude AG \u00b6 \n20(d) is established. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant repeatedly touched a female co-worker \ninappropriately (SOR \u00b6 2.a), and he was terminated for his conduct (SOR \u00b6 2.b). It also \nalleges he falsified material facts on his e-QIP by intentionally failing to accurately \ndisclose the circumstances of his termination in July 2006 (SOR \u00b6 2.c). It alleges he \nfalsified his responses to DOHA interrogatories in December 2008 by intentionally \nfailing to disclose that he had been counseled verbally and in writing by his previous \nemployer (SOR \u00b6 2.d). Finally, it alleges he falsified material facts during a security \ninterview in April 2008 by denying his inappropriate behavior with a female co-worker \nand falsely stating he had not had any \u201cproblems, reprimands, or incidents\u201d prior to the \nallegations of sexual harassment (SOR \u00b6 2.e). \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.b does not allege an act by Applicant. Instead, it alleges his employer\u2019s \nresponse to the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a. As such, it duplicates SOR \u00b6 2.a. When \nthe same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the \nduplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant=s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n04704 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) at 3. Accordingly, I resolve SOR \u00b6 2.b in Applicant\u2019s \nfavor. \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.   \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition pertaining to Applicant\u2019s answer on his e-QIP \nabout his termination by a previous employer is AG \u00b6 16(a): \n \n[D]eliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the government has the \nburden of proving it. An omission or misstatement, standing alone, does not prove an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as \na whole to determine whether an applicant intentionally omitted or misstated material \nfacts. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004).  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nWhile the word \u201cfired\u201d does not appear in his former employer\u2019s investigative file, \nApplicant knew he had been terminated for cause. His explanation for using a less \npejorative term to describe being fired might be plausible if he had not misstated the \nreason for his termination, describing it as an altercation between co-workers instead of \nsexual harassment of a female co-worker. I conclude AG \u00b6 16(a) is raised. \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition pertaining to Applicant\u2019s response to DOHA \ninterrogatories and his responses during an interview with a security investigator is AG \u00b6 \n16(b): \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant facts \nto an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other \nofficial government representative.\u201d Applicant\u2019s explanation for his failure to disclose \nthat he was counseled for repeatedly coming to work without his CAC was that he had \nforgotten about it. I find this explanation implausible and not credible. I conclude AG \u00b6 \n16(b) is raised. \nThree disqualifying conditions are relevant to the allegations of inappropriate \nbehavior alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b. AG \u00b6 16(c) is raised by: \n[C]redible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; \nAG \u00b6 16(d) is raised by: \n[C]redible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of . . . disruptive, violent, or other \ninappropriate behavior in the workplace. \nAG \u00b6 16(e) is raised by: \n[P]ersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas . . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nApplicant denied touching his co-worker sexually, but his supervisor resolved the \nfactual issue against him after considering the complainant\u2019s testimony and the note she \nreceived from Applicant. Applicant\u2019s lack of candor on his e-QIP, his false response to \nDOHA interrogatories, and his false statements to a security investigator lead me to \ndoubt the credibility of his denial and to agree with the factual determination made by \nhis former employer. Accordingly, I conclude that the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n16(c), (d), and (e) are raised.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by false or misleading answers on a security clearance \napplication or during the security investigation may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nindividual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or \nfalsification before being confronted with the facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(a). This mitigating condition \nis not established, because Applicant made no effort to correct or explain his multiple \nmisstatements and omissions until the hearing.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on personal conduct also may be mitigated by showing \nthat \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). Applicant\u2019s inappropriate sexual touching of a female co-worker \nwas a serious breach of his employer\u2019s rules and was properly treated as a serious \noffense by his former employer. Although the time period of his misconduct was \nconfined to one day, it consisted of multiple acts. His conduct did not occur under \nunique circumstances.  \n \nThe second prong of AG \u00b6 17(c) (\u201cso much time has passed\u201d) focuses on \nwhether the conduct was recent. There are no Abright line@ rules for determining when \nconduct is recent. The determination must be based on a careful evaluation of the \ntotality of the evidence.  ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004).  If the \nevidence shows Aa significant period of time has passed without any evidence of \nmisconduct,@ then an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time \ndemonstrates Achanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of \nreform or rehabilitation.@ Id. Applicant\u2019s sexual harassment of a co-worker was three \nyears ago, and there is no evidence of other sexual harassment. On the other hand, \nApplicant falsified his e-QIP in November 2007, falsely denied inappropriately touching \nhis co-worker during a security interview in April 2008, and gave false responses to \nDOHA interrogatories in December 2008. His repeated falsifications negate a finding of \nreform or rehabilitation. I conclude Applicant\u2019s misconduct is recent and it casts doubt \non his trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual has \nacknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken \nother positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(d). Applicant has denied acting inappropriately with a former co-\n\n \n10 \n \n \nworker and offered implausible and incredible explanations for his falsifications. This \nmitigating condition is not established. \n \n \nFinally, security concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe \ninformation was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(f). \nAlthough Applicant has denied acting inappropriately with a former co-worker, his \nmisconduct was established by her statements and the written note she received from \nApplicant. His falsifications were established by the employment records of his former \nemployer. This mitigating condition is not established. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines F and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature adult with a long record of federal service. He has held a \nclearance for many years, apparently without incident. His inappropriate behavior in July \n2006 led to his unemployment and financial difficulties. His repeated falsifications about \nhis employment record cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and \nE, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations, but he \nhas not mitigated the security concerns raised by his personal conduct. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to continue his eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.c-2.e: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The Applicant is 39, married, and has a Bachelor\u2019s degree. He is employed by a defense contractor and seeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. Guideline F, Financial Considerations The Government alleges that the Applicant is financially overextended and therefore at risk of engaging in illegal acts to generate funds. The Applicant admitted both allegations under this guideline. Those admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact. The two allegations in the SOR concern the Applicant\u2019s ownership of a house in City One. In 2003, the Applicant and a friend bought a house together to live in and have as an investment property (rental house). The friend began having financial issues and, in 2004, the Applicant financed the rental house on his own and bought out his partner. This loan was a three year adjustable rate mortgage (ARM). In addition to the first mortgage (SOR 1.b.), the Applicant also took out a home equity line of credit, secured by the same rental house (SOR 1.a.). (Transcript at 22-24.) Also in 2004, the Applicant moved from City One to City Two, in the same state. In order to maintain his mortgage payments, the Applicant rented the rental house to two friends of his.

On December 4, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security\nconcerns under Guideline F concerning the Applicant. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR on January 13, 2009, and requested a\ndecision without a hearing. Pursuant to Paragraph E3.1.7 of the Additional Procedural\nGuidance at Enclosure 3 of the Directive, Department Counsel requested that a hearing\nbe held in this case. (Transcript at 9.) Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on\nFebruary 26, 2009. I received the case assignment on March 11, 2009. DOHA issued a\n\n2\nnotice of hearing on April 8, 2009, setting the hearing for May 20, 2009. The hearing\nwas convened on that date.  \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 4, which were received\nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, called two additional witnesses,\nand submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through C, without objection. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing, and the record closed, on May 28, 2009. Based upon a review\nof the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 39, married, and has a Bachelor\u2019s degree. He is employed by a\ndefense contractor and seeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his\nemployment.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government alleges that the Applicant is financially overextended and\ntherefore at risk of engaging in illegal acts to generate funds. The Applicant admitted\nboth allegations under this guideline. Those admissions are hereby deemed findings of\nfact. \nThe two allegations in the SOR concern the Applicant\u2019s ownership of a house in\nCity One. In 2003, the Applicant and a friend bought a house together to live in and\nhave as an investment property (rental house). The friend began having financial issues\nand, in 2004, the Applicant financed the rental house on his own and bought out his\npartner. This loan was a three year adjustable rate mortgage (ARM). In addition to the\nfirst mortgage (SOR 1.b.), the Applicant also took out a home equity line of credit,\nsecured by the same rental house (SOR 1.a.). (Transcript at 22-24.)\nAlso in 2004, the Applicant moved from City One to City Two, in the same state.\nIn order to maintain his mortgage payments, the Applicant rented the rental house to\ntwo friends of his. This arrangement continued until 2007. (Transcript at 24-27.)\nWhile in City Two, the Applicant met and married his wife. She had three children\nfrom her first marriage and they have had two children since being married. In 2007, the\nApplicant was given an internal job opportunity to return to City One.  He accepted the\nopportunity and returned with his wife and new child.  The children of her first marriage\ndecided to stay in City Two.  This reduced their income by $1,200 a month in child\nsupport. (Transcript at 28-30.)\nOnce they returned to City One, the Applicant and his wife decided to buy their\nown house, and had negotiations whereby the renters could buy the rental house or the\nApplicant would sell the rental house on his own.  The renters declined to buy the rental\nhouse and the Applicant evicted them in early 2007.  Upon reentering the premises, the\n\n3\nApplicant discovered that a lot of damage had been done and that a considerable\namount of repair work would be needed to make the rental house marketable.\n(Transcript at 30-37.)\nAt the same time in 2007, the Applicant\u2019s three year ARM came into effect, which\nresulted in his mortgage payments for this property almost doubling. The Applicant\ndescribed his financial situation in 2007 this way:\nSo with our kids not moving in, my renter basically deciding, you\nknow, to get out of his agreement to purchase the [rental] house, my wife\nnot being able to work [due to pregnancy], and the adjustable loan just\ncontinuing to increase the monthly payment, I couldn\u2019t afford the two\nmortgage payments. We had used most of our savings to buy the new\nhouse, put down a big down payment on that. We had put down a lot more\n\u2013or put a lot more money into the other [rental] house to fix it up and my\njob - - the bonuses that I had discussed when I took the job, the new job,\nthey really didn\u2019t pan out to be quite as high as I thought they were going\nto be as well. (Transcript at 38.)\nSubparagraph 1.a.  The Applicant admits that he owed approximately $45,806\nfor a home equity line of credit on the rental house. As described further under 1.b.,\nbelow, the rental house was foreclosed upon by the primary mortgage holder. The debt\nin this paragraph was a secured line of credit, which was erased by the foreclosure sale\ndescribed below.\nSubparagraph 1.b.  The Applicant admits that he owed $368,000 for a first\nmortgage on the rental house. The Applicant and his wife made the decision to turn the\nhouse back to the lender because they could not make the payments due to the\nsituation described above, and were unable to make a short sale due to economic\nconditions.\nThe mortgage holder took back the property in November 2007 and held a\nforeclosure sale in early 2008. The state\u2019s anti-deficiency statute applied, which means\nthat the mortgage holder is held to the amount received in the foreclosure sale and the\nApplicant has no current debt to them. (Government Exhibit 2 at 5-6; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\nA.)\nThe Applicant\u2019s present financial situation is stable.  His most recent credit\nreports show that he is current on the mortgage on his house, and on all of his other\ndebts. (Government Exhibit 2 at 3, and Exhibit 4; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A; Transcript at 50-\n51.)  \nMitigation\nThe Applicant\u2019s real estate broker/mortgage broker testified. He has known the\nApplicant for 14 years, and personally rented a room to him at one time. He testified that\nthe Applicant\u2019s credit is impeccable and, from personal knowledge, confirmed the basic\n\n4\ndetails of the Applicant\u2019s financial situation, as described in detail above. (Transcript at\n61-65.)\nThe Applicant\u2019s wife also testified. She confirmed the basics of their personal\nsituation, as described above. (Transcript at 67-71.) \nThe Applicant\u2019s current supervisor submitted a letter on the Applicant\u2019s behalf.\nThis gentleman states, \u201c[The Applicant] is always quick on his feet, with sensible\nreactions in all the circumstances I\u2019ve seen him in. I feel confident in saying that he is\ncapable of handling any situation with thoughtfulness and maturity.\u201d (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\nB.)\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision. In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \n\n5\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. AG \u00b6\n19(a) states that, \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d maybe disqualifying. Under\nAG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may also raise security\nconcerns. The Applicant admits that he owed the debts set forth in the SOR. The\nevidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ In addition, AG\n\u00b6 20(b) states that it may be mitigating if \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblems were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., . . . a business downturn . . .),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(c) applies\nwhen, \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there\n\n6\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d Finally,\nunder AG \u00b6 20(d), it is a mitigating factor where \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith\neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d\nThe Applicant made what he thought was a reasonable investment in real\nproperty. Like many people today, he has lost that investment when the market\nslumped. He was forced to make a hard choice, and elected to let the rental house go\ninto foreclosure. Accordingly, he has no current debt on his first mortgage or his home\nequity line of credit because of the foreclosure sale and his state\u2019s anti-deficiency\nstatute. In all other respects, his financial situation is above reproach. His 24 month\npayment history as reflected in the credit report found in Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A reveals no\nother late payments whatsoever.   \nI find the behavior occurred under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely\nto recur, and it does not raise concerns about his current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment. The evidence shows that the problem is under control and that the\nsituation will not be repeated. He has a firm grasp of his financial situation, and has\nshown that he can be relied upon in the future. The evidence raises all the mitigating\nconditions discussed above.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances.  Under AG \u00b62(c), the ultimate determination of\nwhether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person\nconcept.  In addition, the administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative\nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b62(a) in making such a determination: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The Applicant got into financial\ndifficulty because of the economic downturn and the decision by his renters to abandon\nan agreement to buy the rental house. He behaved in a reasonable fashion in\nattempting to resolve this situation, only using foreclosure as a last resort. The Applicant\nhas behaved reasonably and appropriately in trying to resolve his debts, thereby AG \u00b6\n2(a)(6) applies. Under the particular circumstances of this case, I find that there is little\n\n7\nto no potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b62(a)(8)), and that\nthere is little to no likelihood of recurrence (AG \u00b62(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations.  Paragraph 1 is found for the Applicant.  He is currently eligible for a\nsecurity clearance.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

He\noffered no evidence in mitigation of resulting security concerns. Based upon a review of\nthe case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to ADP I/II/III sensitive\ninformation is denied.\nOn April 9, 1993, the Composite Health Care Systems Program Office\n(CHCSPO), the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), and the Assistant\nSecretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (ASD\nC3I) entered into a memorandum of agreement for DOHA to provide trustworthiness\ndeterminations for contractor personnel employed in Sensitive Information Systems\nPositions (ADP I/II/III), as defined in DoD Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security\nProgram, dated January 1987, as amended (Regulation).\nApplicant submitted his Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF 85P), on\nDecember 19, 2007. On May 8, 2009, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to\nApplicant detailing the trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nApril 30, 2010\n\nItem 3.\n1\nItem 4.\n2\nThe government submitted 13 Items in support of the allegations.\n3\nItem 5.\n4\nItems 8, 9, 10.\n5\nItem 12.\n6\n2\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); the Regulation (supra); and the\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 20, 2009.  He partially\n1\nanswered the SOR in writing on June 2, 2009, and completed his answer on September\n3, 2009, requesting that his case be decided by an administrative judge on the written\nrecord without a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written\n2\ncase on September 24, 2009. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)3\nwas provided to Applicant on September 8, 2009, and he was afforded an opportunity\nto file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant\nsigned the document acknowledging receipt of his copy of the FORM on October 8,\n2009, and returned it to DOHA. He provided no further response to the FORM within\nthe 30-day period he was given to do so, did not request additional time to respond,\nand made no objection to consideration of any evidence submitted by Department\nCounsel. The case was assigned to me on January 8, 2010.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 29-year-old employee of a defense contractor, where he started\nworking in August 2007. His SF-85P reflects that he has been continuously employed\nsince November 2000. He is married, with two children, ages 10 and 9.4\nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the financial allegations in the\nSOR, with no explanation. The 22 SOR-listed delinquent debts total $39,434, and their\nexistence is corroborated by Applicant\u2019s credit reports in the FORM.  Applicant\u2019s\n5\nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nApplicant and his wife filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief on December 13,\n2000. This proceeding was dismissed on February 26, 2001, because they failed to\nappear at the meeting of creditors and failed to make the initial payment proposed\nunder their plan.  On March 25, 2002, they filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief, listing\n6\n$59,684 in unsecured non-priority claims. These debts were discharged on July 5,\n\nItem 11.\n7\nItems 6 and 7.\n8\n3\n2002.  All of the SOR-listed debts were incurred after that date. In 2007, a warrant was\n7\nissued against Applicant for the offense of Passing Bad Check - Less than $500.\nApplicant told the investigator from the Office of Personnel Management that he and his\nwife each earn about $26,000 per year, but they are unable to keep up with their credit\nspending and periodically fall behind on rent and other debt payments. He said that \u201che\nand his wife seem to always buy whatever they want without considering the\nconsequences.\u201d Applicant has never met with a credit counselor.  \n8\nApplicant submitted no evidence documenting any effort to contact any of his\ncurrent creditors concerning resolution of his delinquent debts. He submitted no\nevidence about the quality of his work, or about his character in general. I was unable to\nevaluate his credibility, demeanor, or character in person since he elected to have his\ncase decided without a hearing.  \nPolicies\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d\n(Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.) \u201cThe standard that must be met for . . .\nassignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s\nloyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to\nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (Regulation\n\u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security)\nMemorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness adjudications will\napply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service and Office of\nPersonnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the\nright to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access\ndetermination may be made. (Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the\nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of\nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in\nthe adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a\nfair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is\na conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept.\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\n\n4\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable [trustworthiness] decision.\u201d\nA person who applies for access to sensitive information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to sensitive information. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant\nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive information. Such\ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential,\nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. Section 7 of Executive\nOrder 10865 provides that \u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an applicant\nshall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section\n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concerns relating to the Financial Considerations guideline\nare set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.\nUnder AG \u00b6 19(a), an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially\ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d\nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated more than $39,400 in delinquent\ndebts after his July 2002 Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge of almost $60,000 in earlier\ndebt. He submitted no evidence of willingness or ability to satisfy any of these debts.\nThe evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a\ncloser examination.\n\n5\nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s\nhistory of inability or unwillingness to pay his debts spans more than nine years, and\ncontinues to date. He provided no evidence this would not continue or recur, so this\nmitigating condition is not supported by the record.\nUnder AG \u00b6 20(b), it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Applicant\u2019s present\nfinancial problems arose during a period when he was continuously employed, and\nresulted from his admitted failure to conform his spending to his available means. He\ndid not provide an explanation for his failure to make payments, or documentation\ndemonstrating any attempt to resolve his substantial delinquent debt. He has not met\nhis burden to establish that this potentially mitigating condition is a factor for\nconsideration in this case.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under AG \u00b6 20(c). Applicant offered no evidence to support\napplication of this provision. Similarly, AG \u00b6 20(d) applies where the evidence shows\n\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts.\u201d The record is devoid of evidence of any effort at resolution of any SOR-\nalleged debt. Applicant\u2019s 2002 Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharged almost $60,000 in\nprevious debt, but was followed by continued financial irresponsibility. This does not\nconstitute a good-faith effort to resolve his debts. AG \u00b6 20(e) pertains to documentation\nof a legitimate basis to dispute the debts in question. Applicant submitted no evidence\nto support application of this provision, and admitted owing all of the SOR-alleged\ndebts.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the\napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\n\n6\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public\ntrust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature\nindividual who is accountable for his choices. He and his wife incurred more than\n$39,400 in delinquent debts over the seven-year period following their Chapter 7\nbankruptcy discharge by regularly spending more than they earned. Both Applicant and\nhis wife are employed, but they regularly spend in excess of their income despite\nmaking more than $50,000 per year. Applicant made no effective effort to arrange\nresolution of his outstanding debts, demonstrating neither rehabilitation nor permanent\nbehavioral changes. The potential for pressure or duress from his creditors leading to\nexploitation or misuse of sensitive information remains substantial. His pattern of\nsignificant financial delinquency and absence of any effort to learn or implement\neffective budget management make continuation or recurrence of financial\nirresponsibility very likely. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant did not mitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a through 1.y\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\npublic trust position. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.\nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and he is seeking to retain the SECRET security clearance previously granted to him. Applicant\u2019s family has a long history of military service to the United States. His grandfather served in the U.S. Army, and his father was a Vietnam veteran with the United States Marine Corps. Applicant served with the U.S. Air Force and retired as a decorated Master Sergeant in 2006 after 22 years of honorable active service.1 During the first Gulf War, he was deployed overseas as part of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm.2 He has 1 Tr. at 18, 34-36; Government Exhibit 1 (e-QIP, dated Aug. 2, 2007), at 36. 2 Tr. at 36. 3 been gainfully employed by the same defense contractor since June 2007, and currently serves as an avionics technician.3 Applicant was married at the age of 19 in 1985.4 He and his wife had two children, born in February 1987 and January 1992, respectively, and they subsequently divorced in March 1992.5 His children both presently reside with his ex-spouse and her husband.6 In late 1989, Applicant and his spouse returned to the U.S. from an overseas assignment, and he was assigned to a military facility in South Carolina.

On November 6, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended and modified; and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended and modified (Directive). The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline \nF (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a \npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and \nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \nFebruary 24, 2009\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \n \nIt should be noted that on December 29, 2005, the President promulgated \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified \nInformation, and on August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) \npublished a memorandum directing implementation of those revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines (hereinafter AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under \nthe Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel \nSecurity Program (January 1987), as amended and modified (Regulation), in which the \nSOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.  The AG are applicable to Applicant\u2019s \ncase because his SOR was issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 12, 2008. In a sworn, \nwritten statement, dated November 13, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR \nallegations and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. Department \nCounsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on December 8, 2008, and \nthe case was assigned to Administrative Judge Martin H. Mogul on December 12, 2008. \nIt was reassigned to me on January 23, 2009, due to caseload considerations. A Notice \nof Hearing was issued on February 2, 2009, and I convened the hearing, as scheduled, \non February 12, 2009. \n \nDuring the hearing, six Government exhibits and one Applicant exhibit were \nadmitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified. The transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) was received on February 19, 2009. \n \nThe record was kept open until February 19, 2009, to enable Applicant to \nsupplement the record by submitting a copy of his DD Form 214, Certificate of Release \nor Discharge from Active Duty, as well as evidence of satisfaction of a court-ordered \npayment of child support arrearage.  Applicant submitted same on February 13, 2009.  \nHis submissions (marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits B and C) were admitted into evidence \nwithout objection. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the sole factual allegation in \u00b6 1.a. \nof the SOR. \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and he is seeking to \nretain the SECRET security clearance previously granted to him.  Applicant\u2019s family has \na long history of military service to the United States. His grandfather served in the U.S. \nArmy, and his father was a Vietnam veteran with the United States Marine Corps. \nApplicant served with the U.S. Air Force and retired as a decorated Master Sergeant in \n2006 after 22 years of honorable active service.1 During the first Gulf War, he was \ndeployed overseas as part of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm.2 He has \n \n1 Tr. at 18, 34-36; Government Exhibit 1 (e-QIP, dated Aug. 2, 2007), at 36.  \n \n2 Tr. at 36. \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nbeen gainfully employed by the same defense contractor since June 2007, and currently \nserves as an avionics technician.3 \n \nApplicant was married at the age of 19 in 1985.4 He and his wife had two \nchildren, born in February 1987 and January 1992, respectively, and they subsequently \ndivorced in March 1992.5 His children both presently reside with his ex-spouse and her \nhusband.6 \n \nIn late 1989, Applicant and his spouse returned to the U.S. from an overseas \nassignment, and he was assigned to a military facility in South Carolina. It was while \nthey were there that their second child was born. Subsequently they separated, and \neventually divorced.  He was then assigned to another base in the western U.S. and \nshe and the children returned to their home state in the mid-west.  He initially furnished \nher with temporary child support of $260 per month, but felt that the amount was \ninsufficient to care for both children so he agreed to raise the amount to $450.7 In \naddition, he paid her alimony.8 At one point he was paying her a monthly total of $805.9 \nFor the next three or four years, although he experienced difficulties with his ex-spouse \nover visitation rights, especially when she refused Applicant the opportunities to have \nhis youngest child visit him,10 Applicant dutifully continued his child support payments, \nthrough allotment, without incident.11 While exercising periodic visitation rights in the \nmid-west, he provided extra clothing and shoes for both children, over and above his \nnormal payments.12 \n \nAt some point, about four years after the divorce, Applicant became concerned \nthat his ex-spouse was misusing the child support he was providing.  The children were \ndressed poorly and she was apparently spending the money on a new automobile and \nher credit card.13 Unable to resolve their differences, Applicant unilaterally stopped all \nchild support payments for about five or six years before resuming them.14 For \n \n3 Government Exhibit 1, supra note 1, at 14. \n \n4 Id. at 27. \n \n5 Id. \n \n6 Id. at 30-31; Tr. at 55. \n \n7 Tr. at 40. \n \n8 Id. at 65. \n \n9 Id. \n \n10 Id. at 70-71. \n \n11 Id. at 40-41. \n \n12 Id. at 41. \n \n13 Id. at 41, 66. \n \n14 Id. at 42-43. \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \napproximately three years, Applicant\u2019s older son resided with him, but Applicant initially \ncontinued to pay his ex-spouse $200 per month.15 His youngest son moved in with \nApplicant and his older son for a period of six months, and Applicant continued to make \nthe full child support payments.16 At no time while either or both children were residing \nwith him, did Applicant ever petition the court or ask his ex-spouse to either suspend his \nchild support payments or for her to provide him with child support.17 In 2001, Applicant \nwas reassigned overseas, so the children returned to reside with their mother.18 During \nthe next year, he did not make any child support payments.19 In 2004, while serving in \nanother overseas location, Applicant\u2019s wages were garnished in the amount of $450 per \nmonth.20 About two years ago, an arrearage amount of $90 per month also started \nbeing taken from his salary.21 \n \nApplicant\u2019s youngest son resided with him from March until June 2008, and \nApplicant wanted him to remain with him, but his ex-spouse refused.22 In July 2008, the \nstate where the divorce was granted filed a collection action against Applicant for child \nsupport arrearage in the amount of $30,718.23 \n \nOn February 9, 2009, Applicant and his attorney appeared in court, and with an \nagreement of both parties, an Order was entered reducing the child support arrearage.  \nUnder the Order, the civil contempt charge would be purged by Applicant paying his ex-\nspouse $18,000, plus costs, no later than March 27, 2009, and the matter would be \nconsidered closed.24 Once the payment is made, the monthly garnishment of $90 will \ncease, and the amount of his continuing child support will return to $450 per month.25 \nOn February 12, 2009, Applicant made two payments, totaling $3,350, and indicated \nthat since he has the money in an account, the remaining amount will be forwarded to \nhis attorney within a week, well before the deadline.26 \n \n \n15 Id. at 43-44. \n \n16 Id. at 45. \n \n17 Id. at 45-46. \n \n18 Id. at 46. \n \n19 Id. at 46-47. \n \n20 Government Exhibit 1, supra note 1, at 39. \n \n21 Government Exhibit 2 (Retiree Account Statement, dated September 9, 2008, attached to Interrogatories, \ndated September 11, 2008), at 1-2; Tr. at 62-63. \n \n22 Tr. at 68-69. \n \n23 Government Exhibit 4 (Equifax Credit Report, dated July 29, 2008), at 2. \n \n24 Applicant Exhibit A (Order, dated February 9, 2009), at 2. \n \n25 Tr. at 63. \n \n26 Id. at 52, 59. \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \n \nUpon reflection, if Applicant were confronted with the same facts today as he was \nin the past, he would have done things differently.  He would not have resorted to \nfrustration-generated self-help by stopping the child support payments but, instead, \nwould have gone back to court to resolve the unsettled matters.27 \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances are unremarkable, and he has no other financial issues or \ndifficulties.28 In fact, according to his recent Personal Financial Statement, completed in \nSeptember 2008, Applicant has a monthly sum of over $3,200 for discretionary \nexpenses.29 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nAn Administrative Judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nAdministrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of \na number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge \nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d30 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive. Once the Government has \n \n27 Id. at 52. \n \n28 Id. at 79. \n \n29 Government Exhibit 2 (Personal Financial Statement, dated September 4, 2008, attached to \nInterrogatories, supra note 21, at 1. \n \n30 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, \n2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nproduced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe Applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, \nexplanation, extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the \nGovernment\u2019s case.  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as \nwell. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to \nrepose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants \naccess to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d Accordingly, nothing in this Decision should be construed to \nsuggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied \ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. . . . \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly, under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. The evidence is insufficient to establish AG \u00b6 19(a) because \nApplicant was never unable or unwilling to make the payments; he simply was under the \nerroneous impression that he could force his ex-spouse to abide by what he construed \nas the letter or spirit of the court-ordered guidelines for child support payments.  \nMoreover, although there were periods in which Applicant should have made those \npayments, there were also lengthy periods when, if he had gone back to court, the \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \npayments might have been suspended because the children were residing with him and \nnot their mother. \n \nThe evidence does, however, establish AG \u00b6 19(c).  Over a period of years, \nwithout court approval, due to frustration over his ex-spouse\u2019s use of the child support \nhe paid, as well as her thwarting his attempts at child visitation with his youngest son, \nApplicant periodically did not comply with the child support Order. His ex-spouse\u2019s \nfailure to comply with the visitation requirements of the Order did not vitiate his \nresponsibility to continue those child support payments. In his mind, Applicant\u2019s \nmotivation might have been noble and in the best interests of the children. \nNevertheless, they constitute a history of not meeting that one financial obligation.  \nAccordingly, AG \u00b6 19(c) applies.   \n \nThe guidelines also include examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial considerations. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying \ncondition may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is \npotentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the \nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts.@31 Also, AG & 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to \ndispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and \nprovides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence \nof actions to resolve the issue\u201d may apply. \n \nApplicant=s periodic unilateral stoppage of child support payments because of \ndisputes and grievances with his ex-spouse, in contravention of the child support Order, \nis the single most potentially troublesome issue. The child support arrearage, when \nconsidering the circumstances at the time, with Applicant either frustrated with his ex-\nspouse or during periods when his children resided with him, is unlikely to recur \nbecause of several current circumstances.  One son, who turned 22 only days after the \nhearing, is currently enrolled in college. The other son, now 17 and in high school, will \nnot be Applicant\u2019s responsibility much longer.  Furthermore, now that Applicant and his \n \n31 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must present \nevidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith \naction aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person \nacts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 \nAccordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \n\u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case \nNo. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nwife have agreed on a resolution of their long-standing dispute, and he has engaged the \nprofessional services of a domestic relations attorney to counsel, represent, and guide \nhim, he is better aware of the potential problems of self-help regarding the stoppage of \nchild support. \n \nConsidering the evidence pertaining to the confusion over child support with \nchanging living arrangements for the children, as well as the ensuing court action, these \ncircumstances no longer exist. There are clear indications that Applicant\u2019s financial \nissue has been resolved and is under control.  He is well on his way toward satisfying \nthe child support arrearage and is timely with his current child support payments. His \nactions in addressing his debt indicate good-faith efforts on his part as well as showing \nclear indications the problem is now largely under control.  The evidence establishes \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e). \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. In his frustration, Applicant travelled \ndown the wrong path toward resolving his disputes with his ex-spouse. Some of his \nactions were brought about by the confusion surrounding his child support \nresponsibilities when his children were residing with him rather than their mother. He \neventually sought legal guidance, and has taken decisive affirmative action and made \nsubstantial good-faith efforts to pay off or resolve his sole legitimate delinquent debt, the \nchild support arrearage. The age of his children, the mutual agreement with his ex-\nspouse in resolving their disputes, and the newly found wisdom gained from the bad \nexperience, along with an attorney to counsel and represent him, greatly diminish the \nlikelihood of recurrence. (See AG && 2(a)(2), 2(a)(5), 2(a)(6), and 2(a)(9).)  \n \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nOf course, the issue is not simply whether all his debts are resolved; it is whether \nhis financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. \nI am mindful that while any one factor, considered in isolation, might put Applicant\u2019s \ncredit history in a sympathetic light, I have evaluated the various aspects of this case in \nlight of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal \nanalysis.32 Considering his continuing good-faith efforts, the circumstances behind the \nchild support arrearage, the nature of his legitimate disputes with his ex-spouse, and his \nquestionable responsibility for child support when the children were residing with him for \nlengthy periods, his past financial situation, as it pertains to the former child support \narrearage, is insufficient to raise continuing security concerns. (See AG & 2(a)(1).)   \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and statements submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 24 years old years old and works for a defense contractor. He submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on January 2, 2008. He is a high school graduate and is not married. Applicant admits he used marijuana from 2001 to October 2008. In April 2008, Applicant provided a statement to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator and confirmed its accuracy on October 9, 2008. In the statement he confirmed his intention to continue to use marijuana in the future because he enjoys the way it makes him feel.1 Applicant admits he purchased marijuana from approximately 2001 to October 2008. He admits he sold marijuana in the past. He admits he used cocaine in approximately 2003 and 2004. He admits he used hallucinogenic mushrooms in approximately 2004 and 2005. He admits he used LSD in approximately 2003 and 2004. He does not intend in the future to use illegal drugs, other than marijuana.2 In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR he stated the following: \u201cBased on reading Guideline H, it is clear to me that I am not eligible for [a] security clearance at this time.\u201d3 N When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn March 30, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nto Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline \nH, Drug Involvement. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 13, 2009, and elected to have his \ncase decided on the written record. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s \nfile of relevant material (FORM) on May 21, 2009. Applicant received the FORM on May \n \n1 \n \n \nAugust 19, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \no other information was provided. \n \nPolicies \nh are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n                                                          \n26, 2009. Applicant was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not object to the FORM and did not \nsubmit additional material. The case was assigned to me on August 6, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and statements submitted, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 24 years old years old and works for a defense contractor. He \nsubmitted a security clearance application (SCA) on January 2, 2008. He is a high \nschool graduate and is not married. \n \n \nApplicant admits he used marijuana from 2001 to October 2008. In April 2008, \nApplicant provided a statement to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \ninvestigator and confirmed its accuracy on October 9, 2008. In the statement he \nconfirmed his intention to continue to use marijuana in the future because he enjoys the \nway it makes him feel.1  \n \n \nApplicant admits he purchased marijuana from approximately 2001 to October \n2008. He admits he sold marijuana in the past. He admits he used cocaine in \napproximately 2003 and 2004. He admits he used hallucinogenic mushrooms in \napproximately 2004 and 2005. He admits he used LSD in approximately 2003 and \n2004. He does not intend in the future to use illegal drugs, other than marijuana.2 \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR he stated the following: \u201cBased on reading \nGuideline H, it is clear to me that I am not eligible for [a] security clearance at this \ntime.\u201d3 \nN\n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, whic\n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n \n1 Item 6. \n \n2 Item 4 and 6. \n \n3 Item 4. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \non as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nn 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnal sis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement:  \nperson's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common-sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likew\n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant h\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolati\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Sectio\ny\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a \n\n \n4 \n \n \n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and \ninclude: (1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified \nand listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., \nmarijuana \nor \ncannabis, \ndepressants, \nnarcotics, \nstimulants, \nand \nhallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other similar substances;  \n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a \nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction. \n \nUnder Title 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435c(b) a security clearance may not be granted for a \nperson who is an unlawful user of a controlled substance or an addict. \n \n \nI have considered all of the drug involvement disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 \n25 and have especially considered the following: \n \n(a) any drug abuse;  \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of drug paraphernalia; and \n \n(h) expressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and \nconvincingly commit to discontinue drug use. \n \nApplicant has a significant history of possession and use of illegal drugs from \n2001 to October 2008. He has sold illegal drugs in the past. He intends to continue to \nuse marijuana. I find the above disqualifying conditions apply. \n \n \nI have considered all of the drug involvement mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 \nand conclude none apply. Applicant did not offer any relevant evidence in mitigation.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n5 \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n        \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant admits he \npossessed and used illegal drugs from 2001 to October 2008. He sold illegal drugs in \nthe past. He intends to continue to use marijuana in the future. Applicant failed to offer \nany relevant mitigating evidence regarding his past drug history. In addition, I find \nApplicant is disqualified from being granted a security clearance under Title 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n435c(b) because he intends to continue to use marijuana. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising under the guideline for Drug Involvement. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.h: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the relevant circumstances presented by the record in this case, it \nis not clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) on February 20, 2008 (GE 1). On September 23, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing the Government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations).1  \n  \n \n1  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nJanuary 8, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                     \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 20, 2008, and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on October 31, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on November 5, 2008. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on November 11, 2008. The government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, \nwhich were received without objection (Tr. 18). Applicant testified on his own behalf and \nsubmitted exhibits (AE) 1 through 5, which were received without objection (Tr. 22). I \ngranted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until December 12, 2008, to submit \nadditional matters. He submitted AE 6 - 8 post-hearing. DOHA received the transcript of \nthe hearing (Tr.) on December 2, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, \n1.e, 1.f, and 1.k to 1.p. He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, and 1.g to 1.i. After \na thorough review of all evidence of record, including his demeanor and testimony, I \nmake the following findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 54-year-old computer help desk manager in charge of an eight \nperson team. He works for a government contractor providing computer support to a \ngovernment agency (Tr. 56-57). He graduated from high school, and has completed \napproximately two years of college courses on and off over the years (Tr. 5). He last \nenrolled in college during the fall of 2007 seeking a degree in computer information \nassurance and computer forensic investigation (Tr. 49). He served in the U.S. Army \nReserve from 1970 to 1987 (Tr. 81-82).2 He also claimed he served two years on active \nduty from 1972 to 1974. In 1987, he was honorably discharged from the Reserves at the \nrank of private first class (E-3).  \n \nApplicant married his first wife in 1978 and they were divorced in 1984. He \nmarried his second wife in 2000 and they were divorced in 2001. He has two adult \nchildren, ages 31 and 26 (Tr. 81). \n \nIn February 2008, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (GE 1). \nHe disclosed that in 1983 and 1984 he was charged with possession of a dangerous \ncontrolled substance and served one year probation for each conviction. There is no \nevidence to show Applicant has been involved with illegal drugs since then. He also \nreported that in March 2006, he left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of \nunsatisfactory performance.3 \n \n \n2  Applicant\u2019s testimony is discrepant with information he provided in section 16 of his security \nclearance application (GE 1). GE 1 indicates he served approximately one year in the Army Inactive \nReserve (1973), and from June 1980 to May 1985. He also claimed he received an honorable discharge \nform the U.S. Army National Guard. There are no documents in the record to corroborate his assertions. \n \n3  The SOR has not alleged this adverse information is of security concern, and I have not made \nany negative inferences or conclusions based on this information. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                     \nApplicant has worked for his current employer, a government contractor, since \nDecember 2007. He claimed to be a valuable employee with a good working record. \nSince December 2007, his gross salary has been approximately $57,600 a year, or \nabout $3,100 net a month (Tr. 74). He also receives a $50 stipend for driving his \nchurch\u2019s bus during the weekends. He lives with his father and pays $700 rent. He \nclaimed to have no loans or financial obligations other than those discussed during his \nhearing. His monthly net remainder is around $400 (Tr. 74). \n \nIn his answers to the e-QIP financial questions, Applicant indicated he had his \nwages garnished by his state\u2019s child support enforcement agency, and that during the \nlast seven years he was over 180 days delinquent in some debts. Applicant\u2019s \nbackground investigation addressed his financial problems, and included the review of \nMarch and August 2008 Credit Bureau Reports (CBR). \n \nThe SOR alleges fifteen delinquent/charged off accounts totaling approximately \n$42,600. SOR \u00b6 1.a ($6,679)4 is a debt for legal fees incurred by Applicant and his \nsister (Tr. 58-62). Applicant claimed he made some initial payments; however, he \npresented no evidence to support his claim. Applicant\u2019s sister made all the payments on \nthis debt from August 2006 to August 2008 (AE 1). In 2008, Applicant\u2019s sister filed for \nbankruptcy protection and was discharged of this debt. He is now disputing the debt, \nbecause he believes his sister\u2019s bankruptcy discharge also released him of this \nobligation. However, Applicant did not provide any evidence that he filed for bankruptcy \nprotection. He has made no payments on this debt since August 2008. He claimed he \ncontacted the creditor to dispute the debt.  \n \nApplicant admitted the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b ($519). At his hearing, he \nclaimed he was getting a large sum of money in December 2008 (source undisclosed), \nand promised to pay the debt (Tr. 33). Applicant settled this debt for $400 and paid it on \nDecember 9, 2008 (AE 6). He did not explain the origin of the money he used to pay the \ndebt. \n \nApplicant admitted the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($409). He claimed he settled \nthe debt in October 2008 for $266. He promised to pay it on December 5, 2008 (Tr. 34-\n36). Applicant paid this debt around December 23, 2008 (AE 7). SOR \u00b6 1.d ($813) \noriginated as a result of arrearages on his child support obligations. Applicant paid the \ndebt on June 11, 2007 (Tr. 27).  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e ($6,586) and 1.f ($8,879) both concern car notes. In 2003, Applicant \nreceived a \u201csecond chance\u201d auto loan (SOR \u00b6 1.f) to buy a used 2002 Dodge Stratus for \n$12,000 (Tr. 84-87). He claimed the car was stolen and wrecked by the thief. Applicant \nclaimed he had cancelled the car insurance because he was in the process of buying a \nnew car (Tr. 39). Applicant settled this account for less than its full value and paid it off, \npresumably, in January 2007 (GE 2 at 9). \n \n \n4  SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a debt of $16,026. Applicant\u2019s sister paid most of the debt. The outstanding \nbalance is around $6,679. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                     \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e ($6,586) is still outstanding. In 2003, Applicant \nbought a used 2002 Chevy Malibu (Tr. 36, 67, 86). He testified this car was also broken \ninto and, in June 2008, he decided to return the car to the dealer. At his hearing, \nApplicant promised to contact the creditor and make payment arrangements (Tr. 66-67). \nAs of December 11, 2008, he claimed this debt was in mediation for payment \narrangements (AE 6). \n \nApplicant disputed SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g ($2,837) and 1.h ($3,277). Both debts are \ndelinquent credit card accounts (Tr. 39-40). Applicant disputed both debts because the \ncreditor did not specify whether the account holder was Applicant or his father. \nApplicant lives with his father, and both have the same name. His father had a stroke in \n2003 and became disabled. Applicant admitted he had a credit card account with the \nsame bank, but could not recall when (Tr. 68). He denied any of these two alleged debts \nwere his, because the total amount of the charges was too high. To his recollection, his \ncredit card account was a \u201csecond chance credit card\u201d and had a $500 limit (Tr. 41). He \nclaimed he disputed these debts and they are under investigation. He presented no \nevidence to show he has formally disputed these accounts. Both debts are outstanding. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i ($1,000) alleged a debt to an unspecified medical provider. Applicant \nclaimed he formally disputed the debt and it is under investigation. He promised to pay it \nif it turned out to be his debt (Tr. 42).5 \n \nApplicant\u2019s evidence shows he paid the following debts: SOR \u00b6 1.k ($784), paid \non September 24, 2008 (Tr. 42, AE 6); SOR \u00b6 1.l ($73), paid on November 14, 2007 \n(AE 4); SOR \u00b6 1.m ($874), paid on December 9, 2008 (AE 6); SOR \u00b6 1.n ($350), settled \nbefore the hearing and paid on December 5, 2008 (Tr. 42, AE 6); and SOR \u00b6 1.o ($100) \npaid on November 24, 2008 (Tr. 42, AE 6). Applicant claimed he also paid SOR \u00b6 1.p \n($107) on November 25, 2008 (Tr. 42, AE 6); however, he submitted no documentary \nevidence to support this claim. \n \nApplicant expressed remorse for his financial problems. He acknowledged he \nshould have been more diligent in addressing his debts (Tr. 48). He believed his old \ndelinquent debts were closed, and as such, he did not have to pay them anymore. \nAlthough he has been consistently employed since 2000-2001, Applicant explained he \nfell behind on his debt payments because he was underemployed and underpaid. Since \n2003, he could not find a good paying job and struggled financially (Tr. 83). He claimed \nhe was willing to pay his debts, but he did not have the financial means to make all his \nold debt payments and afford his day-to-day living expenses. He was making those \npayments he could afford.  \n \nIn the summer of 2007, he sought and received financial counseling through his \nchurch (Tr. 76). He promised to resolve all his delinquent debts as soon as possible (Tr. \n79). Applicant sees his ability to obtain access to classified information as an \u201copen \n \n5  The SOR does not contain any subparagraph 1.j. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                     \ndoor\u201d to his financial and professional well being. He understands he must clean up his \ncredit to pursue his professional goals. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.6 \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d7 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \n \n6  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n7  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the security concern is that an Applicant\u2019s failure or inability to \nlive within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor \nself-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of \nwhich can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of \nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \nThe SOR alleges fifteen delinquent/charged off accounts totaling approximately \n$42,600. Of these, I find that four of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts remain outstanding: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($6,679), 1.e ($6,586), 1.g ($2,837), and 1.h ($3,277), for a total of \napproximately $19,379. Applicant paid the following debts during 2007: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f, \n1.k, and 1.l. He paid the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.m-1.p after receipt of \nhis September 2008 SOR.   \n \nApplicant presented some evidence of efforts to pay or resolve his legal \nobligations. He claimed he did not have the financial means to pay his legal obligations, \ndelinquent debts, and his day-to-day living expenses. AG \u00b6 19(a): inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts; and, AG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial \nobligations, apply in this case.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant application of any mitigating conditions. AG \n\u00b6 20(a) does not apply because his financial problems are not isolated. He currently has \nfour delinquent debts that are still outstanding. The ongoing nature of his delinquent \ndebts shows \u201ca continuing course of conduct.\u201d  \n \n \nApplicant presented evidence that established circumstances beyond his control \ncontributing to his inability to pay his debts, i.e., he was underemployed / underpaid. AG \n\u00b6 20(b) applies, but only partially. Applicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to show he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. This is evidence, in part, by his purchase of \nseveral vehicles, apparently beyond his financial means. He made some effort to \nresolve his debts by entering into settlement agreements and paying some of his \ncreditors. However, Applicant failed to take any action to resolve his debts until after he \nwas confronted about his delinquent debts during the security clearance background \ninvestigation process. He has been consistently employed since 2000-2001. His efforts \nto repay delinquent debts started in 2007. He presented no corroborated evidence of \nefforts to resolve his delinquent debts from 2001 to 2007. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply because, although he paid 10 of his delinquent debts, \nthere are no clear indications that his financial problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol. His inability to pay his debts shows he was financially overextended. \nFurthermore, Applicant failed to explain where he obtained the funds to pay for his \ndelinquent debts during 2007 and 2008. There is the concern that Applicant may have \njust shifted the debt to another creditor(s), or that he acquired additional debt beyond \nhis financial means. He currently has four delinquent SOR debts totaling $19,379. \nApplicant failed to establish that he is no longer financially overextended. Considering \nthe totality of the circumstances, Applicant\u2019s actions to repay his creditors do not raise \nto the level of good-faith efforts to resolve his debts. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n8 \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature, well trained \nman. He honorably served two years of active duty service and 15 years in the National \nGuard. He has been successful working for a defense contractor since December 2007. \nBecause of his time in the service, age, and education, Applicant knew or should have \nknown the importance of being financially responsible. His behavior shows he lacks \nself-control, judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence fails to convince me of Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a; 1.e, 1.g, \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nand 1.h: \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b - 1.d,  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n1.f, and 1.i \u2013 1.p: \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJUAN J.

The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline B\non April 27, 2009. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 11, 2009. She answered the\nSOR in writing in May 2009. Department counsel decided to proceed with a hearing\nDecember 23, 2009\n\nResponse to SOR.\n1\nGE 1; Tr. 13-14.\n2\nGE 1; Tr. 13, 15, 18-19, 28-29, 37.\n3\n2\nbefore an administrative judge, and was prepared to proceed on July 21, 2009, and I\nreceived the case assignment on September 3, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing\non September 25, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on October 20, 2009.\nThe government offered two exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, which were received and admitted\ninto evidence without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf. She did not\nsubmit any exhibits at the hearing. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on\nOctober 28, 2009. I requested documents from the Applicant and held the record open\nuntil November 4, 2009. She timely submitted three exhibits (AE) A through C, without\nobjection. The record closed on November 4, 2009.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nRequest for Administrative Notice \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to Ukraine. (Tr. 11-12.) The request and the attached documents\nwere not admitted into evidence but were included in the record as Hearing Exhibits I\nand II. In addition, Hearing Exhibits III and IV are included in the record. The facts\nadministratively noticed must be limited to matters of general knowledge and matters\nnot subject to reasonable dispute. (Tr. 12.) The facts administratively noticed are set out\nin the Findings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a,\n1.b, and 1.c of the SOR.   \n1\nApplicant, who is 48 years old, works as an engineer for a Department of\nDefense contractor. She began her work with this employer in November 2006.  \n2\nApplicant was born in the Ukraine when it was part of the Union of Soviet\nSocialist Republics (the Soviet Union). She graduated from high school and attended\ncollege in the Ukraine. She received a bachelor\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering.\nShe married her first husband in 1981 in the Ukraine. They had two sons, now ages 27\nand 23, who were born in the Ukraine. She and her first husband divorced in 1998 while\nstill living in the Ukraine. Applicant\u2019s contact with her first husband is limited to special\noccasions and matters related to their sons. Her first husband works in private\nconstruction, building houses.  \n3\n\nTr. 24-25.\n4\nApplicant\u2019s first husband lives in the apartment with his wife.\n5\nTr. 18-19, 37.\n6\nGE 2; Tr. 13-14, 19-20\n7\nAE B; AE C; Tr. 13-14, 20-21.\n8\n3\nApplicant worked as a ship designer in the Ukraine ship building industry until\n1991. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, her employer laid her off. For the next\nten years, she worked in a hospital as an engineer.4\nApplicant and her first husband purchased an apartment in the Ukraine. Although\nthey are divorced and her first husband has remarried, Applicant still owns a 25%\ninterest in this apartment.  Applicant\u2019s sons each own a 25% interest in this apartment\n5\nand her first husband owns the remaining 25%. Applicant estimates the value of the\napartment at $40,000. When the real estate market improves, she would like to sell the\napartment.  \n6\nApplicant met her second husband, an American citizen, in 2000. She\nimmigrated to the United States as a fiancee in 2001. Her two sons immigrated with her\nin 2001. After arriving in the United States, Applicant married her second husband. She\nbecame a United States citizen in 2006. She possesses a passport from the United\nStates, which she uses to travel to the Ukraine. She and her second husband divorced\nin 2007, but are discussing remarriage.  \n7\nApplicant\u2019s oldest son became a United States citizen on July 20, 2009. He\nmarried a Ukrainian citizen, whom he met in the United States, in the Ukraine. His wife\nrecently gave birth to a son in the Ukraine. Applicant\u2019s grandson is a citizen of the\nUnited States. Her son is currently in the process of completing the necessary\npaperwork to bring his wife and son to the United States. Applicant\u2019s younger son has\napplied to become a United States citizen and had his citizenship interview on\nNovember 10, 2009.8\nApplicant\u2019s parents are citizens of and reside in the Ukraine. Her father, who is\n75 years old, served in the Navy of the Soviet Union as a machinist mate, from 1954\nuntil 1957. He worked in the ship building industry as a mechanical engineer for many\nyears. He still works one day a week for a privately owned shipbuilding company. Until\n1991, her father\u2019s company built warships. Since 1991, the company builds skin for\ncruise ships, including European companies, under contracts. Her mother, who is 71\nyears old, is a retired nurse. She receives a retirement benefit from the government. Her\n\nPrior to the collapse of the Soviet Union, her parents were required to be members of the communist party\n9\nif they wanted to work. This requirement ended in 1991.

She has\nvisited them four times since immigrating to the United States, the last time in 2009,\nwhen she attended her son\u2019s wedding. Applicant talks with her parents once a week.\nShe would like to bring them to the United States, but is not sure if they will come.\nApplicant has one cousin in the Ukraine. She visits with her cousin when she is in the\nUkraine. She does not have any other close family members. She does not have\nregular contact with her former co-workers. When she is in the Ukraine, she may pass\none of them on the street. They stop and talk briefly. She visits with friends when she is\nin the Ukraine, but she does not have any additional contact with them.11\nApplicant has substantial assets in the United States. She lives in a trailer on six\nacres of land, which she values at $125,000. She has a $92,000 mortgage on this\nproperty. She has a 401k account worth $5,000, two Individual Retirement Accounts\n(IRA) worth about $4,500, a car, and a savings account worth $50,000. Her second\nhusband gave her a quit claim deed to the house they owned when married. The value\nof this house is unknown. She does not owe any money to anyone in the Ukraine and\nwill not receive any benefits from the Ukraine. She voted in the recent elections in the\nUnited States. She may inherit her parents apartment, which is valued at $35,000. She\ndoes not anticipate a significant inheritance as her parents are not wealthy.12\nI take administrative notice of the following facts. The Ukraine is a republic with a\nmixed presidential and parliamentary system. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in\n1991, the Ukraine has been an independent country, undergoing significant political and\neconomic change. The Ukraine has rich farmlands, a well-developed industrial base, a\nhighly trained labor force, and a good educational system. The Ukraine seeks\nadmission into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). To achieve this goal, the\nUkraine must modernize its military. The Ukraine has taken the first steps towards this\ngoal. The Ukraine also seeks entry in the World Trade Organization and European\nUnion. The Ukraine tries to maintain a good relationship with Russia, a relationship that\nis difficult and complex. The Ukrainian government respects the rights of its citizens to\nfree speech, to practice religion, and to free press. There are significant human rights\nissues with the police when arresting or detaining individuals. There is no evidence that\nthe Ukraine seeks to obtain sensitive or classified information from the United States.\nThe Ukraine has received billions of dollars in aid from the United States to help with its\ndevelopment as a democratic state. The documents provided do not discuss terrorism\n\nHearing Exhibits 1 to 4.\n13\n5\nor acts of terrorism in the Ukraine. There is no evidence that terrorist groups operate in\nthe Ukraine or that the Ukrainian government targets its citizens or citizens of the United\nStates. Overall, the Ukraine and the United States have a good relationship.13\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nan applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \n\n6\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in\nAG & 6:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism. \nUnder the potential disqualifying conditions described in AG \u00b6 7, the following\nconditions could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case:\n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a\nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to\nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual's desire to\nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and\n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign\ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which\ncould subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or\nexploitation.\nApplicant has a son who is a naturalized U.S. citizen and resides in the United\nStates. He second son is a resident of the United States and is actively applying for his\nUnited States citizenship. Thus, no security concern is raised by these family members.\nApplicant\u2019s mother and father are citizens and residents of the Ukraine. Applicant\nmaintains a normal, familial relationship with her mother and father. She talks with them\n\n7\nby telephone about once a week. She visits her parents at least every two years. She\nreturned to the Ukraine for her son\u2019s wedding in May 2009. She does not provide\nfinancial support to her parents. Her family relationships are not per se a reason to deny\nApplicant a security clearance, but her contacts with family members must be\nconsidered in deciding whether to grant Applicant a clearance. The government must\nestablish that these family relationships create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion or would create a potential conflict of\ninterest between her obligations to protect sensitive information and her desire to help\nher family members.  \nIn determining if a heightened risk exists, I must look at Applicant\u2019s relationship\nand contacts with family members as well as the activities of the government of the\nUkraine and terrorist organizations within the Ukraine. See ISCR Case No. 07-05809\n(App. Bd. May 27, 2008). The risk that an applicant could be targeted for manipulation\nor induced into compromising classified information is real, not theoretical. The record\ncontains no information which indicates that terrorist organizations are active in the\nUkraine. While there is no indication the government of the Ukraine targets its citizens,\nthe human rights record of the Ukrainian police forces is dismal. The information of\nrecord fails to show that the Ukrainian government engages in espionage activities in\nthe United States or that it targets United States citizens in the United States or the\nUkraine by exploiting, manipulating, pressuring, or coercing them to obtain protected\ninformation. As a former nation in the Soviet Union and because the Ukraine continues\nto foster ties with Russia, Applicant\u2019s relationship and contacts with her mother and\nfather in the Ukraine raises a heightened risk of security concerns.\nUnder the new guidelines, the potentially conflicting loyalties may be weighed to\ndetermine if an applicant can be expected to resolve any conflict in favor of the U.S.\ninterests. In determining if Applicant\u2019s contacts in the Ukraine cause security concerns, I\nconsidered that the Ukraine and the United States have a close relationship and there is\nno evidence that the Ukrainian government targets United States citizens for protected\ninformation. The human rights issues in the Ukraine continue to be a concern. While\nnone of these considerations by themselves dispose of the issue, they are all factors to\nbe considered in determining Applicant\u2019s vulnerability to pressure or coercion because\nof her family members in the Ukraine. Thus, Applicant\u2019s recent trips to the Ukraine and\ncontacts with her family in the Ukraine raise a heightened risk concern under AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a)\nand (b).\nIn deciding if Applicant has established mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(a), I must\nconsider: \nthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in\nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual,\ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.;\n\n8\nand under AG \u00b6 8(b), I must consider whether Applicant has established:\n \nthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is\nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interests.\nApplicant\u2019s normal relationship with her parents is not a basis to deny her a\nsecurity clearance; however, her burden of proof on mitigation requires her to establish\nthat she will not be placed in a position of having to chose between her parents and the\nUnited States. See ISCR Case No. 07-02485 (App. Bd. May 9, 2008). Her parents have\nnever held a political position. Applicant\u2019s parents have not been targeted by the\nUkraine and there is little likelihood the Ukrainian government would do so in the future.\nHer parents have never been imprisoned and there is not any evidence that they have\nsuffered any abuses from the Ukraine government. Her closest family members, her two\nsons, are residents of the United States. She owns two pieces of property and has\nsignificant monetary assets in the United States. She owns a 25% interest in an\napartment in the Ukraine. Her interest is valued at $10,000 and equals about 5% of her\ntotal assets. Balancing these factors and the lack of evidence that the Ukrainian\ngovernment targets U.S. citizens for protected information against the Ukraine\u2019s poor\nhuman rights record, I find that Applicant would resolve any conflict in favor of the U.S.\ninterests. Her loyalties are to the United States, not the Ukraine. Applicant has mitigated\nthe government\u2019s security concerns as to her family contacts specified in the SOR\nunder AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b).\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or deny a security\nclearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both favorable and\n\n9\nunfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the evidence of record,\nnot a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is established and then\nwhether it is mitigated.  \n \nThe evidence in support of granting a security clearance to Applicant under the\nwhole person concept is more substantial than the evidence in support of denial. In\nreaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\nwas born and raised in the Ukraine when it was part of the Soviet Union. When the\nSoviet Union collapsed, she continued to live and work in the Ukraine with her first\nhusband and their sons. In 2001, after her divorce, she came to the United States as a\nfiancee with her sons. She married the same year and became a naturalized citizen in\n2006. Her older son is now a United States citizen and her younger son is in the\nprocess of becoming a citizen. She regularly talks with her parents and visits them in\nthe Ukraine periodically. Her parents do not know she works for a federal contractor.\nOther than her mother\u2019s retirement income, her parents have no contacts with the\nUkrainian government. Her parents are not in a position where they are likely to be\nexploited or pressured by the Ukrainian government. There is little chance Applicant will\nbe placed in a position of having to chose between her parents and the United States.\nIn the event she should be placed in such a position, her strong loyalty to the United\nStates would prevail. Applicant\u2019s contacts with her parents in the Ukraine and her\nminimal financial interest do not raise an unacceptable security concern.  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from her foreign influence.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\n\n10\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) on September 10, 2010, detailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) that provided the basis for its preliminary decision to deny her a\nsecurity clearance. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines\nFor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG) implemented on\nSeptember 1, 2006. \n \nMarch 30, 2011\n\nW hen  SOR allegations are controverted, the government bears the burden of producing evidence sufficient\n1\nto prove controverted allegations. Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cThat burden has two components. First, the\ngovernment must establish by substantial evidence that the facts and events alleged in the SOR indeed took\nplace. Second, the government must establish a nexus between the existence of the established facts and\nevents and a legitimate security concern.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 07-18525 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2009),\n(concurring and dissenting, in part) (citations omitted). The guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See\nISCR Case No. 08-06605 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 4, 2010); ISCR Case No. 08-07290 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 17,\n2009).\nItem 5.\n2\nResponse to SOR.\n3\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on September 10, 2010. She\nsubmitted a notarized, written response to the SOR allegations dated October 1, 2010\nand a second response dated October 29, 2010, and requested a decision on the\nwritten record in lieu of a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) and mailed\nApplicant a complete copy on December 27, 2010. Applicant received the FORM on\nJanuary 13, 2011. She had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and\nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. She submitted a response,\nwhich she mailed on March 11, 2011. DOHA assigned this case to me on March 21,\n2011. The Government submitted ten exhibits, which have been marked as Items 1-10\nand admitted into the record. Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR has been marked and\nadmitted as Item 4, and the SOR has been marked as Item 1. Her response to the\nFORM is marked as Applicant exhibit (AE) A.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a,\n1.b and 1.d of the SOR. Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. She\ndenied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g of the SOR.  She also provided\n1\nadditional information to support her request for eligibility for a security clearance. After\na complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following\nadditional findings of fact.  \nApplicant, who is 55 years old, works as a dispatcher for a Department of\nDefense contractor. She began working for her employer in June 1986, almost 25 years\nago. She received her first security clearance in 2005. The record contains no evidence\nthat Applicant mishandled sensitive or classified information or that Applicant has\nencountered problems in the workplace.2\nApplicant and her husband married in September 1988. They have one son, who\nis 23 years old. Her husband works in the trucking industry. In the last 10 years, he lost\ntime from work due to illness and the fluctuations in the business cycle as related to the\ntrucking industry. Their income has been directly impacted by his variable income.3\n\nItem 10.\n4\nItem 8; Item 9; AE A.\n5\n3\nAccording to her personal financial statement attached to her responses to\ninterrogatories, Applicant earns $2,130 a month in gross income and receives\napproximately $600 a month in net pay. She lists $1,532 in payroll deductions without\nan explanation for the high level of deductions. Her husband\u2019s net income is listed at\n$4,000 a month, for a household net income of $4,600. Her monthly expenses total\n$2,141 and include a first mortgage payment of $485, a second mortgage payment of\n$248, utility expenses of $250, car expenses of $250, a car payment of $348, medical\nexpenses of $250, food expenses of $150, and three other expenses of $160. At the\nend of each month, Applicant has approximately $2,460.\nThe SOR identified six purportedly continuing delinquencies as reflected by credit\nreports from 2008 and 2010, totaling approximately $34,764. Some accounts have been\ntransferred, reassigned, or sold to other creditors or collection agents. Other accounts\nare referenced repeatedly in both credit reports, in many instances duplicating other\naccounts listed, either under the same creditor or collection agency name or under a\ndifferent creditor or collection agency name. Some accounts are identified by complete\naccount numbers, while others are identified by partial account numbers, in some\ninstances eliminating the last four digits and in others eliminating other digits.\nApplicant and her husband filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on August 18, 1997.\nAccording to the court docket sheet, they reaffirmed two debts. On December 5, 1997,\nthe court discharged their remaining debts. A copy of their bankruptcy petition, including\na list of creditors, is not included in the record. The six debts identified in the SOR\nbecame delinquent after Applicant and her husband\u2019s bankruptcy discharge.4\nConcerning the $14,830 debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.b, Applicant advised in her\nresponse to the FORM that she reached an agreement with the collection agent for this\ndebt to pay $200 a month. She provided a copy of a letter dated February 15, 2011,\nwhich indicated that a payment for $200 would be withdrawn from her account on\nFebruary 23, 2011. The letter is from a known collection agent, but does not specify the\nname of the original creditor or original account number. Applicant has not provided any\nother documents showing the relationship between the collection agent and the original\ncreditor, nor has she provided documents showing when her payments began and how\nmuch she has paid on this debt. She did indicate in her two October 2010 responses\nthat she was paying $200 a month on this debt. The May 1, 2008 and November 6,\n2008 credit reports indicated that this debt had been charged off and the account\nclosed. The collection agent is not listed on any credit report in the record.5\nApplicant admitted that she was behind in her mortgage payment in the amount\nof $4,623 as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. When her husband became ill and missed time from\nwork, she could not make all her mortgage payments. She stated that she is current on\nher payments and has paid her arrearage. She, however, did not provide any\n\nItem 4; Item 7 - Item 9.\n6\nItem 4; Item 7 - Item 9; AE A.\n7\nItem 7- Item 9.\n8\n4\ndocuments reflecting that she paid her past due amounts and that she is current. The\nJuly 12, 2010 credit report shows that she is still past due on her mortgage in the\namount of $4,623. The May 1, 2008 credit report indicates that her mortgage was\ncurrent, but the November 6, 2008 credit report shows that she was behind at least two\npayments beginning in July 2008.6\nApplicant denied owing any money to the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c (credit card -\n$7,835), 1.e (store account - $1,776), 1.f (credit account - $2,700), and 1.g (credit\naccount - $3,000). She acknowledged having an account with each creditor in the\ndistant past, but stated that, to the best of her knowledge, each account had been paid.\nIn her response to the FORM, she stated that she believed these four accounts had\nbeen included in her 1997 bankruptcy. The May 1, 2008 credit report reflects that all\nfour accounts have a zero balance and have been closed because the account had\nbeen purchased by another lender. Except for the credit card debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c, the\nname of the current holder of the remaining three debts is unknown, as the debt is not\nlisted on the credit report under the name of the new owner. As to the debt in SOR \u00b6\n1.c, the May 1, 2008 credit report shows that the original bank creditor sold the debt to\nanother bank, which sold the debt to a collection agency. The credit reports of record do\nnot list either of the subsequent purchasers as an owner of this debt. Applicant indicated\nthat she has no way to contact the creditors as she has not received any\ncorrespondence from them. The May 1, 2008 credit report shows a mailing address for\neach of the original creditors for these fours debts, but the November 6, 2008 and July\n12, 2010 credit reports contain no contact information for the original creditors.7\nApplicant has not submitted documentation which shows that she attempted to\nvalidate these debts with the creditors or that she had disputed the validity of the debts\nwith the credit reporting agencies. Likewise, the record does not contain documentation\nshowing that she received credit counseling.\nThe three credit reports in the record indicate that Applicant pays or has paid\nmany of her debts in a timely manner. The credit reports also reflect that she paid a\nnumber of past due debts.8\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n5\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\n\n6\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes the disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns.\nI have considered all the conditions, and especially the following:\n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and\n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant developed significant financial problems when her husband lost time\nfrom work due to illness and their finances were impacted by the work fluctuations of the\ntrucking industry. Most of the debts listed in the SOR remain unresolved. These two\ndisqualifying conditions apply.\nThe Financial Considerations guideline also includes examples of conditions that\ncan mitigate security concerns. I have considered mitigating factors AG \u00b6 20(a) through\n20(f), and especially the following:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts; and\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\nWith the exception of her mortgage debt, Applicant\u2019s remaining debts became\npast due between November 2003 and November 2005. Her mortgage debt problems\nare more recent. Her financial problems are the result of her husband\u2019s variable work\n\n7\nand his illness, which makes AG \u00b6 20(b) partially applicable. Because she has not\nprovided evidence that she acted reasonably under the circumstances, stating instead\nthat she has not heard from the creditors or received information that she still owes\nthem money, this mitigating condition is not fully applicable. Under the guidelines, she\nhas an affirmative duty to contact the creditors listed in the SOR about paying her debts.\nBecause there is no evidence that she has contacted her creditors or the credit\nreporting agencies, or that she has paid the debts listed in the SOR, the remaining\nmitigating conditions are not applicable.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. The decision to grant or\ndeny a security clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both\nfavorable and unfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the\nevidence of record, not a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is\nestablished and then whether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility\nfor a security clearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct,\nbut on a reasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a\nnexus exists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nIn reaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\nhas worked for 25 years with her employer. She is an employee in good standing. Her\nfinancial problems are related to her husband\u2019s variable work and his health. She paid a\nnumber of old past-due debts that are not listed on the SOR. This shows that she has\nacted responsibly about some of her past debts and supports her statement and limited\ndocumentation that she is paying the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.b $200 a month. She is\nprobably current on her mortgage, but she has not provided the documentation which\nshows she paid her mortgage arrearage. Her main problem is a lack of documentation\nconcerning the four remaining debts listed in the SOR, which total approximately\n\n8\n$15,400. Without evidence of efforts on her part to dispute the debts remaining on her\ncredit reports, Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns about her finances.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her finances under\nGuideline F.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nJune 23, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on February 11, 2008 (Government Exhibit 1).  On December 17, 2008, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\ndetailing the security concerns under Guideline F concerning the Applicant.  The action\nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR on February 5, 2009, and initially requested\na decision without a hearing.  Subsequently, on February 27, 2009, the Applicant\nrequested that his case be converted to a hearing before an Administrative Judge.\nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on February 27, 2009.  I received the\n\n2\ncase assignment on March 1, 2009.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 2,\n2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on March 26, 2009. \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 7, which were received\nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits A through F, without objection.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing,\nand the record closed, on April 13, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 43 and divorced.  He is employed by a defense contractor and\nseeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is financially\noverextended and therefore at risk of engaging in illegal acts to generate funds.  The\nApplicant admitted the factual allegation, but denied that his conduct showed poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations.\nThe Applicant served in the United States military from June 1994 until July\n2005.  This included tours in Korea and Iraq.  Upon his discharge from the military, the\nApplicant had difficulty finding full time employment.  He was unemployed for five\nmonths following his discharge, and also for three months in 2006.   He began full-time\nemployment with his current employer in April 2007.  (Government Exhibit 1 at question\n11.)\nDuring the same time, the Applicant became divorced from his wife, and began\nto have child support obligations.  Because of this, he was unable to keep up on other\nbills other than his child support, and room and board.  (Transcript at 21-22.)\nSubparagraph 1.a.  The Applicant admits that he owed approximately $12,034.00\nfor a motorcycle.  The Applicant fell behind several payments on this debt, but the\nvehicle was not repossessed.  He has made a payment arrangement with the successor\nin interest, and has been paying $175.00 a month since July 2008.  As of March 2,\n2009, the debt had been reduced to $11,334.22.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F; Transcript at\n25-28.)  The Applicant testified that the creditor is satisfied with this arrangement.  His\ndesire is to save an amount sufficient to pay off the debt at a lessor, arranged, amount.\n(Transcript at 35-37.)\nMitigation\nThe Applicant has worked for his current employer for two years.  They are very\nsatisfied with his performance.  Co-workers describe him as \u201creliable\u201d and \u201chonest.\u201d\n\n3\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A and B.)   His supervisor says that the Applicant is a \u201cdedicated\u201d\nand \u201cdependable\u201d employee.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.)\nThe Applicant submitted evidence that he successfully paid off a child support\narrearage.  In addition, he has made voluntary arrangements to pay his child support in\na timely manner in the future.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits D and E.)\nThe Government\u2019s credit bureau reports show that he has paid off or resolved all\nof his debt other than the motorcycle loan.  The Applicant submits that this supports his\nargument that he shows good judgment with regards to his debts.  (Government\nExhibits 2, 3, 5 and 6.)\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \n\n4\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise security concerns.\nThe Applicant admits that he owes the debt set forth in SOR subparagraph 1.a.  The\nevidence is sufficient to raise this potentially disqualifying condition, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ In addition, AG\n\u00b6 20(b) states that it may be mitigating if \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblems were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, . . . or a\ndeath, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances.\u201d  AG \u00b620(c) applies if \u201cthere are clear indications that the problem is\n\n5\nbeing resolved or is under control.\u201d  Finally, \u00b6 20(d) applies where, \u201cthe individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d\n After leaving the military, the Applicant divorced from his wife and went through\na years long period of unemployment and underemployment.  Once his financial\nsituation was stable, the Applicant began working with the successor in interest on the\nmotorcycle loan.  They agreed to freeze the interest and have the Applicant only pay the\nprincipal.  This the Applicant has been doing in a timely fashion that is acceptable to the\ncreditor.  In all other respects his financial condition is fine.  I find that all of these\nmitigating conditions are applicable to this case.\n \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b62(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b62(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant got into financial\ndifficulty because of his separation from his wife, and because of a prolonged period of\nunemployment and underemployment after leaving the military.  He has arranged with\nhis sole creditor to pay his debt over time, and is fulfilling this arrangement.  He has\nbehaved reasonably and appropriately in trying to resolve his debts, thereby AG \u00b6\n2(a)(6) applies.  Under the particular circumstances of this case, I find that there is little\nto no potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b62(a)(8)), and that the\nlikelihood of recurrence is close to nil (AG \u00b62(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations.  Paragraph 1 is found for the Applicant.  He is currently eligible for a\nsecurity clearance.\n\n6\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Glendon, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug \nInvolvement) and E (Personal Conduct), based on cocaine use and failure to disclose \nan arrest for a felony and a drug offense in an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) and a response to interrogatories. Applicant refuted \nthe allegation that she intentionally failed to disclose the felony arrest, but she did not \nmitigate the security concerns based on her cocaine use. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on April 9, 2008. On \nNovember 5, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny her \napplication, citing security concerns under Guidelines H and E. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \nMarch 13, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on November 11, 2008; answered it on November \n18, 2008; and requested a determination on the record without a hearing. DOHA \nreceived the request on November 21, 2008. Department Counsel requested a hearing \nand was ready to proceed on January 29, 2009. The case was assigned to me on \nJanuary 30, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 6, 2009, scheduling \nthe hearing for February 24, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government \nExhibits (GX) 1 through 5 were admitted in evidence without objection. GX 6 was \nmarked as an exhibit but was not offered or admitted. Applicant testified on her own \nbehalf. The record closed upon adjournment of the hearing on February 24, 2009. \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on March 2, 2009. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nI took administrative notice of three sections of the state criminal code defining \nthe crime of burglary. The documents setting out the applicable provisions of the state \ncriminal code were not admitted in evidence but are attached to the record as Hearing \nExhibits (HX) I, II and III. The provisions of the state criminal code that were \nadministratively noticed are set out below in my findings of fact. \n \nUncharged Misconduct \n \n \nDepartment Counsel presented evidence that Applicant falsely denied illegal \ndrug use when she submitted a Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions (SF 85) in \nSeptember 2007. This conduct was not alleged in the SOR. Conduct not alleged in the \nSOR may be considered to assess an applicant=s credibility; to evaluate an applicant=s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; to consider whether an \napplicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; to decide whether a particular \nprovision of the adjudicative guidelines is applicable; or in the whole person analysis. \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (citations omitted). Additionally, \nan administrative judge may consider security concerns not alleged in the SOR when \nthey are relevant and factually related to a disqualifying condition that was alleged. \nISCR 05-01820 at 3 n.4 (App. Bd. Dec. 14, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-18860 at 8 \n(App. Bd. Mar. 17, 2003) and ISCR Case No. 02-00305 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 12, 2003)). I \nhave considered Applicant\u2019s falsification of her SF 85 for the limited purposes of \ndetermining her credibility, evaluating evidence of rehabilitation, and in my whole person \nanalysis. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations of drug \ninvolvement, but she denied intentionally concealing her arrest record. Her admissions \nin her answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old integration and test technician employed by a federal \ncontractor. She has worked for her current employer since August 1999. She is married \nand has two sons, ages 16 and 12. She has never held a clearance. \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions (SF 85) on \nSeptember 4, 2007, and she answered \u201cno\u201d to the question whether she had used \nillegal drugs during the last year (GX 3 at 3). In a response to DOHA interrogatories \ndated September 27, 2008, Applicant admitted that she used cocaine once in July 2007, \nabout two months before she submitted her SF 85. She also admitted using cocaine \nonce in June 2008 (GX 2 at 2). In response to DOHA\u2019s question about her intentions \nregarding future use and frequency, she wrote \u201cnone.\u201d  \n \n \nApplicant testified that she was unaware of the sensitivity of the questions when \nshe submitted her SF 85. She testified she did not feel it was necessary to disclose her \ncocaine use because she believed the questionnaire was simply a background check \n(Tr. 50). \n \nWhen Applicant submitted her e-QIP in April 2008, she disclosed that she used \ncocaine about six times between July 2003 and June 2007. She explained that her \ninstances of cocaine use were \u201cisolated incidents that occurred at a few social \ngatherings.\u201d She stated, \u201cI have learned from this experience and have not used this \nsubstance since June 2007\u201d (GX 1 at 29).  \n \nAt the hearing, she testified she told a security investigator in May 2008 that she \ndid not intend to use illegal drugs again (Tr. 57). She also admitted that she used \ncocaine in June 2008, about two months after submitting her e-QIP and one month after \ndeclaring her intention to not use illegal drugs again (Tr. 59). At the hearing, she \ntestified she does not intend to use drugs again (Tr. 89). \n \nApplicant testified that she used cocaine with her friends about once a year. It \nusually occurred when someone offered it and she would take \u201ca couple of sniffs just to \nstay there and keeping going for a little while longer.\u201d She does not believe she is \naddicted, and she has never entered a treatment program (Tr. 37-38, 63). She testified \nshe has not used cocaine or any other illegal drug since June 2008 (Tr. 60). She has \nbeen in situations where cocaine was offered, and she has declined (Tr. 62). She \ncontinues to associate with the friends with whom she has used cocaine (Tr. 62, 70-71). \nHer husband knows about her cocaine use, but her sons do not (Tr. 75). \n \nWhen Applicant submitted her e-QIP, she answered \u201cno\u201d to six questions about \nher police record, including questions whether she had ever been charged with or \nconvicted of a felony or any offenses related to alcohol or drugs; and whether in the last \nseven years she had been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offenses not \nlisted in the other questions (GX 1 at 28). In a response to DOHA interrogatories five \nmonths after she submitted her e-QIP, she stated she was arrested in July 1983 for \ntrespassing, and the charges were disposed of by placing her on probation before \njudgment (GX 2 at 5).  \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nState criminal records reflect that on August 14, 1983, five days before \nApplicant\u2019s 19th birthday, she was charged with breaking and entering with intent to \nmurder, theft, trespassing on posted property, and unlawful possession of a controlled \nsubstance. The records reflect that a bail bond hearing was held on August 15, 1983, \nand all charges were dismissed on September 27, 1983 (GX 4 at 3). \n \nApplicant testified her arrest occurred when she and a group of four friends were \nboating, and they docked at a private pier. Applicant and a friend asked \u201ca couple of \ngentlemen\u201d if they could use the bathroom in the waterfront home adjacent to the pier. \nAccording to Applicant, the gentlemen did not respond. Applicant and her friend \napproached the house, noticed that the door was ajar, knocked on the door, and called \nout, \u201cIs anybody home?\u201d No one responded, and they entered the house, wandered \naround for a short time, and left the house after they could not find the bathroom (Tr. \n66). \n \nAs they left, the police had arrived and were arresting three of Applicant\u2019s friends \nwho had remained at the pier, and they also arrested Applicant and her friend who had \nentered the house with her (Tr. 40). One of the persons arrested was her now-husband \n(Tr. 45). Applicant and her friends were jailed. Applicant\u2019s brother refused to post bail for \nher, and she remained in jail for two days until her mother posted bail (Tr. 46, 77). She \nremembered that the experience was \u201cvery scary.\u201d It was her first and only arrest (Tr. \n67-69). She denied possessing marijuana on her person at the time of her arrest, and \nthere are no records documenting the basis for this charge. She testified she could not \nremember much about the court proceedings, except that the judge told her and her \nfriends that they would be on probation before judgment for a year (Tr. 46).  \n \nAs requested by department counsel, I have taken administrative notice of the \ncurrent state criminal code sections pertaining to three degrees of offenses involving \nbreaking and entering a residence. All three degrees of breaking and entering are \nfelonies. The state criminal code was redrafted and reorganized after Applicant\u2019s arrest. \nThe offenses are now captioned as burglary, which is defined as the breaking and \nentering of the dwelling of another. The words \u201cwith intent to murder\u201d reflected on the \nstate criminal records do not appear in the criminal code sections administratively \nnoticed, but the revised code contains a requirement that the breaking and entering be \nwith intent to commit a criminal offense. Recognizing that the criminal code has been \nchanged since Applicant\u2019s arrest, I have limited my administrative notice to the fact that \nbreaking and entering a residence with intent to commit murder was a felony at the time \nof Applicant\u2019s arrest. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \n\n \n5 \n \n \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \nThe SOR alleges Applicant used cocaine approximately eight times from July \n2003 to June 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and she has admitted using it about six times. AG \u00b6 24 \nexpresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \u201cUse of an illegal drug or \nmisuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it raises questions \nabout a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d \nDrugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include: \n\u201cDrugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled \nSubstances Act of 1970, as amended.\u201d AG \u00b6 24(a)(1). Drug abuse is defined as \u201cthe \nillegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved \nmedical direction.\u201d AG \u00b6 24(b). Cocaine is listed in Schedule II of the Controlled \nSubstances Act. \nDisqualifying conditions under this guideline include Aany drug abuse,@ and \nAillegal drug possession,\u201d and \u201cfailure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue \ndrug use.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), (c), and (h). Applicant admitted using cocaine, and the manner \nin which she used it necessarily encompassed possessing it, thus raising AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) \nand (c).  \nApplicant disclosed her prior drug use on her e-QIP in April 2008, and she \ndeclared she had learned her lesson about the implications of drug abuse. She was \ninterviewed in May 2008 and unequivocally stated that she did not intend to use illegal \ndrugs again, but she used cocaine a month later. Cocaine use is socially acceptable in \nher circle of friends. Although she knows the \u201ccorrect\u201d answer that she must give to \nobtain a clearance, her declarations of intent to refrain from future drug abuse are not \nconvincing. Thus, I conclude AG \u00b6 25(h) is raised. \nThe government has produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), (c) and (h), shifting the burden to Applicant to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of \nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the \ngovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \nSecurity concerns raised by drug involvement may be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 26(a). The first clause of \u00b6 \n26(a) (Ahappened so long ago@) focuses on whether the drug involvement was recent.  \nThere are no Abright line@ rules for determining when conduct is Arecent.@ The \ndetermination must be based on a careful evaluation of the evidence. ISCR Case No. \n02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). If the evidence shows Aa significant period of \n\n \n7 \n \n \ntime has passed without any evidence of misconduct,@ then an administrative judge \nmust determine whether that period of time demonstrates Achanged circumstances or \nconduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.@ Id.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s last admitted drug use was in June 2008, about eight months before \nthe hearing, and about one month after she told a security investigator she would never \nuse it again. Her frequency of use has been once or twice a year. In the context of a \nfive-year record of occasional but regular cocaine use and repeated broken promises to \nabstain, abstinence for eight months is not \u201ca significant period of time.\u201d Thus, I \nconclude her cocaine use was \u201crecent,\u201d not \u201cinfrequent,\u201d and did not happen under \nunusual circumstances. Her repeated cocaine use after she submitted a security \nclearance application and after she asserted to an investigator that she would never use \nit again casts doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I conclude \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns arising from drug involvement also may be mitigated by \nevidence of Aa demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the \nenvironment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; (4) a \nsigned statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation.@ AG \n\u00b6 26(b)(1)-(4). The record reflects none of these indicia of intent to abstain from drugs. I \nconclude AG \u00b6 26(b) is not established. No other enumerated mitigating conditions are \napplicable. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant falsified her e-QIP by failing to disclose her arrest for \na felony breaking and entering and unlawful possession of marijuana (SOR \u00b6 2.a), and \ngave misleading answers to DOHA interrogatories by stating she was arrested only for \ntrespassing (SOR \u00b6 2.b). The SOR also cross-alleges Applicant\u2019s drug use as personal \nconduct under this guideline (SOR \u00b6 2.c).  \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \nOf special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the \nsecurity clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security \nclearance process.   \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition pertaining to Applicant\u2019s omissions from her \ne-QIP is set out in AG \u00b6 16(a), which applies to:  \n \ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \n\n \n8 \n \n \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition pertaining to Applicant\u2019s omissions from her \nresponses to DOHA interrogatories applies to \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading \ninformation concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, \ncompetent medical authority, or other official government representative.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(b). \n \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the government \nhas the burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove an applicant\u2019s \nstate of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the \nrecord evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial \nevidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. See ISCR \nCase No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004).  \n \n \nApplicant demonstrated her lack of appreciation for the importance of candor \nwhen she executed her SF 85 in September 2007, but she was candid about her \ncocaine use when she executed her e-QIP in April 2008. Two issues must be resolved \nto determine if Applicant falsified her e-QIP and her response to DOHA interrogatories \nwith respect to her arrest in 1983: (1) Did she know she was charged with a felony \nbreaking and entering and possession of marijuana at the time she was arrested in \n1983? and (2) Did she remember being charged with a felony breaking and entering \nand possession of marijuana at the time she executed the e-QIP in April 2008? \n \n \nThe arrest was almost 30 years ago, when Applicant was only eighteen years \nold. She found it a frightening experience. She vividly remembered spending two nights \nin jail, but her memory was vague about the formal charges or court proceedings. \nExcept for her testimony at the hearing, there is no evidence showing the basis for the \ncharges. She was accompanied by her mother in court, but she did not have a lawyer. \nShe could not remember an arraignment, but she was certain that she would have \nspoken up if she heard that she was charged with intending to commit murder. Although \nDepartment Counsel made several references to a plea bargain in his questions, there \nis no evidence of a plea bargain. Her testimony regarding the allegations of falsification \nwas plausible and credible. I am satisfied that she did not intentionally conceal \ninformation when she submitted her e-QIP and responded to DOHA interrogatories. \nAccordingly, I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and (b) are not raised. \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions based on Applicant\u2019s use of cocaine are AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 16(c), (e), and (g). AG \u00b6 16(c) applies to \ncredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but \nwhich, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \n\n \n9 \n \n \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics \nindicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected information. \nAG \u00b6 16(e) applies to \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as . . . \nengaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal, professional, or \ncommunity standing.\u201d Finally, AG \u00b6 16(g) applies to \u201cassociation with persons involved \nin criminal activity.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of cocaine use raises questions about her judgment and \nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. It has made her vulnerable to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress. It would likely have an adverse effect on her \nprofessional and community standing. She continues to associate with users of illegal \ndrugs. I conclude AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d), (e), and (g) are raised. \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on personal conduct may be mitigated if \u201cthe offense is \nso minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). Applicant\u2019s \nrepeated uses of cocaine were not \u201cminor\u201d offenses, were recent, did not occur under \nunusual circumstances, and cast doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. For these reasons and the reasons set out above in the discussion of AG \u00b6 \n26(a) under Guideline H, I conclude AG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual \nhas acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or \ntaken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that \ncaused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is \nunlikely to recur.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(d). Applicant acknowledged her behavior, but she has not \nobtained counseling or made any changes in her life to alleviate the causes of her illegal \ncocaine use. Thus, AG \u00b6 17(d) is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to \nreduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(e). \nApplicant\u2019s teenaged sons are unaware of her cocaine use, making her vulnerable to \nthreats of exposure to her sons. Thus, AG \u00b6 17(e) is not established. \n \n \nFinally, security concerns may be mitigated if \u201cassociation with persons involved \nin criminal activity has ceased or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt \nupon the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with \nrules and regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(g). Applicant continues to associate with her cocaine-\nusing friends under the same circumstances that existed when she used cocaine in the \npast. Thus, AG \u00b6 17(g) is not established. \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the \ntime of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines H and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature, intelligent adult. She has repeatedly promised to stop \nusing cocaine, but those promises ring hollow in light of her continued use after \npromising to stop. She has made no significant lifestyle changes to reinforce abstinence \nfrom illegal drugs. She has not demonstrated that she will resist the situational pressure \ncaused by continued association with cocaine users. There is a significant likelihood of \nrecurrence. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines H and \nE, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has refuted the allegations of falsifying her e-QIP and her responses to DOHA \ninterrogatories, but she has not mitigated the security concerns based on her drug \ninvolvement and personal conduct. Accordingly, I conclude she has not carried her \nburden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H (Drug Involvement):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant \nseeks a security clearance in conjunction with his employment. \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed his financial problems and \nincluded the review of credit reports from April 2008 (Item 5), November 2008 (Item 6), \nand May 2009 (Item 7). Additionally, it considered Applicant\u2019s answers to DOHA \ninterrogatories (Items 8 and 9), which included an April 2008 Office of Personnel \nManagement Personal Subject Interview and a Personal Financial Statement. \n \nThe DOHA interrogatories asked Applicant (in part) to explain or document the \nstatus of 14 delinquent accounts totaling $118,284. Applicant explained that he lost his \njob and after finding a new job, he experienced a reduced salary of approximately 50%. \nApplicant was unemployed for a three-month period from October 2002 to December \n2002.3 He stated he has been unable to remain current on his bills as a result of being \nunemployed or underemployed. His wife, who handled the family budget, determined \nwhich bills would be paid. His Personal Financial Statement includes the income of his \nfull and part-time job as well as his wife\u2019s salary. Referring to his Personal Financial \n \n \n2 Item 4 (March 2008 e-QIP) is the source for the facts in this paragraph unless otherwise stated. \n \n3 Id. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \nStatement, Applicant stated, \u201cAs you can see there is barely enough to meet the \nmonthly obligations, let alone, any past debts\u201d (Item 9). \n \nApplicant failed to address any of his delinquent debts. He failed to provide any \ninformation as to how he acquired the debts, why they became delinquent, what efforts \nhe took, if any, to resolve his debts, and what measures he has taken to avoid similar \nfinancial problems in the future. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d4 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \n4 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 \nF.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \ngovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).5 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the relevant security concern is under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two financial considerations disqualifying conditions that could \nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, his answers to \nDOHA interrogatories, and his SOR response.  \n \nApplicant has submitted no documentation to show he has a reasonable basis to \ndispute the legitimacy of the debts alleged in SOR. He admitted responsibility for the 14 \nunpaid delinquent debts totaling $118,284.00. The government established the \ndisqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). Considering the record as a whole, I \n \n5 \u201cThe administrative judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n5 \n \n \nconclude his debts are valid delinquent debts, and that Applicant is responsible for \nthem.  \n \n  \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sparse favorable evidence fails to fully raise the applicability of any \nmitigating condition. His financial problems are ongoing and his evidence fails to show \nthey occurred under such circumstances that they are unlikely to recur and do not cast \ndoubt on Applicant's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) \ndoes not apply. \n \n \n \nApplicant presented some evidence that established circumstances beyond his \ncontrol contributing to his inability to pay his debts, i.e., his three-month period of \nunemployment. AG \u00b6 20(b) applies, but only partially. Applicant\u2019s evidence is not \nsufficient to show: 1) why he was unemployed; 2) to what extent this period of \nunemployment affected his current financial situation; and 3) whether he acted \nresponsibly and with judgment under the circumstances.  \n \n \nApplicant presented no evidence of effort to contact creditors or to resolve his \ndebts by entering into settlement agreements or payment plans with any creditors. \nOther than the above-mentioned period of unemployment, he has been consistently \nemployed. He presented no evidence of efforts to resolve any of his delinquent debts. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply because, there are no clear indications that his \nfinancial problem is being resolved or is under control. His inability to pay his debts \nshows he is financially overextended. He also failed to present any evidence that he \nreceived financial counseling, and that his financial problems are not likely to recur. The \nremaining mitigating conditions are not reasonably raised by the facts in this case. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial history and lack of favorable evidence preclude a finding that \nhe has established a track record of financial responsibility, or that he has taken control \nof his financial situation. Based on the available evidence, his financial problems are \nrecent, not isolated, and are likely to be a concern in the future. He has not carried his \nburden of proving his financial responsibility. His overall financial behavior casts doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nApplicant\u2019s record of employment working for a government contractor weighs in \nhis favor. Aside from his delinquent debts (which is a civil, non-criminal issue), he is a \nlaw-abiding citizen. These factors show some responsibility and mitigation.   \n \nThe evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct is more substantial. He has \na significant history of delinquent debt that has been ongoing. Applicant submitted no \ndocumentation to show he has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \ndebts, that he has attempted to contact his creditors to settle or resolve debts alleged in \nthe SOR, or that he is receiving or has ever received financial counseling to assist him \nwith his financial difficulties. Applicant has not produced evidence showing that he has \nacted responsibly or prudently in managing his financial affairs over several years, and \n\n \n7 \n \n \nit is clear from the record that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are recent and appear \nlikely to be a continuing concern in the future.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to financial considerations.    \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \n \n Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. to 1.n.: \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nROBERT J. TUIDER \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "analysis of the pertinent mitigating conditions and of the whole-person factors was impaired by his alleged consideration of the Army ROI. However, as stated above, there is no basis in the record to conclude that the Judge was aware of the contents of this document beyond what was intimated in Department Counsel\u2019s questioning. Neither is there a basis to conclude that he considered the document as substantive evidence. Therefore, Department Counsel\u2019s questions do not provide a reason to disturb the Judge\u2019s analysis of Applicant\u2019s case for mitigation. 3 5 Applicant also contends that the Judge misinterpreted some of his testimony. Specifically, he disagrees with the following comments in the Analysis portion of the decision: When asked whether he would commit the offenses if he had it to do all over again, he was evasive. He lacked sincere empathy for the victims, and instead emphasized the impact of the offenses on himself and his family. Decision at 11. Applicant points to testimony, for example, in which he expresses remorse. He also explains his apparently equivocal answer to a question about whether he would commit the offenses again as simply an acknowledgment that good things, such as having met his wife, can follow on the heels of bad things. However, a Judge is presumed to have considered all the evidence in the record. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-00196 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009); ISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (App. Bd. May 23, 2008).

Garcia, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nNina J. Ginsberg, Esq.\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On July 9, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline\nD (Sexual Behavior) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On January 15, 2010, after the hearing, Administrative\nJudge Mark Harvey denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant\nto Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in permitting\nDepartment Counsel to question Applicant concerning a prior statement and whether the Judge\u2019s\nadverse security clearance decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error,\nwe affirm.\nThe Judge found that Applicant is a 36-year-old systems engineer working for a Defense\ncontractor.  He served in the Army from 1992 to 1993.  He is married and has children.  \nApplicant\u2019s father deserted his family when Applicant was nine.  His mother remarried when\nApplicant was twelve.  Applicant\u2019s older sister sexually abused him when he was eleven to thirteen\nyears of age.  Applicant had problems in school and, as an adolescent, was depressed and sometimes\nsuicidal.  He received therapy for his emotional problems for six years.  \nWhile in junior high school, Applicant was tutored by the wife of an Army officer.  Even\nafter graduating from high school, Applicant continued a friendly relationship with the family and\nwas permitted to provide child care for their twelve-year-old daughter.  From August to October\n1992 Applicant, then nineteen, engaged in sex acts with the daughter.  He did so about ten times.\nHe also engaged in such acts with another twelve-year-old girl twice.  These acts included digital\npenetration of one of the children.  \nApplicant entered the Army in 1992.  While Applicant was on active duty, the FBI\nquestioned him about his sexual activity with the two young girls.  As a result of the investigation,\nApplicant was prosecuted.  He pled guilty to one count of engaging in a sexual act with a minor and\nanother count of engaging in sexual contact with a minor.  Applicant was sentenced to fifteen months\nof confinement and served thirteen months.  \nApplicant must register as a \u201csexually violent offender.\u201d  Decision at 7.  After his release\nfrom jail, Applicant received counseling from a psychiatrist.  The psychiatrist concluded that\nApplicant has a low risk of reoffending.  He stated at the hearing that, at the time of the offenses,\nApplicant was emotionally immature but that he now exhibits an appropriate emotional age. \nDue Process Violation\nApplicant contends on appeal that the Judge denied him due process.  The basis for the\ncontention is Department Counsel\u2019s cross examination of Applicant, in which she questioned him\nabout statements he made in the investigation of the sex offenses.  Applicant contends that, through\n\nApplicant\u2019s counsel was placed on notice as to the nature of the extrinsic evidence by Department Counsel\u2019s\n1\nstatement to the Judge, \u201cIt\u2019s a Department of Army report of investigation.\u201d  Tr. at 144.  \n3\nthe questioning, Department Counsel was able to present inadmissible evidence to the Judge and that\nthe Judge considered this evidence in formulating his decision.\nNear the close of the hearing, the Judge asked Applicant about the extent of his sexual\ncontact with the victims.  He asked Applicant if the victim whom he digitally penetrated had touched\nApplicant\u2019s genitals.  Applicant replied, \u201cNot that I recall, no.  I don\u2019t believe so . . . My penis never\nleft my pants.  I don\u2019t believe that she ever fondled my penis. . . I can\u2019t say truthfully, whether it did\nor didn\u2019t.  I don\u2019t believe it did[.]\u201d Tr. at 141.  \nUpon cross examination, Department Counsel questioned Applicant about statements he\nmade to the FBI during its investigation of the offenses.  These statements were summarized in a\nReport of Investigation (ROI) prepared by officials of the U.S. Army.  \n[Question]: Do you recall making a statement to the FBI?\n[Answer]: I recall making a statement.  I don\u2019t recall the specifics of that statement.\nHowever, I will say that in truthfulness, if it was a statement I made to the FBI, it was\nmore than probably accurate.\n[Question]: Okay. . . During that . . . interview, you said\u2013told the interviewer that on\ntwo occasions, this one girl masturbated you with her hand.  Do you recall that at all?\n[Answer]: I don\u2019t recall the memory, but I\u2019m not disputing the accuracy.  Tr. at 142-\n143.\nDepartment Counsel never offered the ROI into evidence, and it is not attached to the file.\nApplicant has attached it to his brief.  Although we cannot consider new evidence, we have, in the\npast, considered extra-record information for the purpose of resolving other issues, such as\njurisdiction or due process concerns.  See ISCR Case No. 08-07664 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2009).\nAccordingly, we have examined Applicant\u2019s submission of this ROI in order to evaluate its nature\nand the uses which Department Counsel made of it.  However, we have not considered this\ndocument as substantive evidence of the SOR allegations.\nIn considering this issue, we first note that at no time during the questioning did Applicant\u2019s\ncounsel raise an objection.  Neither did counsel request an opportunity to examine the document\nwhich formed the basis of the questioning at issue here, nor did she seek additional time to prepare\na response to the document\u2019s contents.   This objection is raised for the first time in Applicant\u2019s\n1\nappeal brief.  Accordingly, we conclude that Applicant has waived this issue for purposes of appeal.\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-22461 at 7 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005).  See also ISCR Case No. 94-0084 at 5\n(App. Bd. Dec. 13, 1994). \n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 613, Prior Statements of Witnesses \n2\n(a) Examining Witness Concerning Prior Statement.  \nIn examining a witness concerning a prior statement made by the witness, whether written or not, the statement need not\nbe shown nor its contents disclosed to the witness at that time, but on request the same shall be shown or disclosed to\nopposing counsel.\n(b) Extrinsic Evidence of Prior Inconsistent Statement of Witness.  \nExtrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement by a witness is not admissible unless the witness is afforded an\nopportunity to explain or deny the same and the opposite party is afforded an opportunity to interrogate the witness\nthereon, or the interest of justice otherwise require[.]   See U.S. v. Vasquez, 225 Fed. Appx. 831 at 833 (11  Cir. 2007)\nth\n(Prior inconsistent statements offered for impeachment purposes are not hearsay.)  See also Jankens v. TDC\nManagement, 21 F.3d 436, 442 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (An oral statement by a witness can be used for impeachment purposes,\nincluding oral statement recorded in writing by some third party.)   \nApplicant argues that the Army ROI was not admissible evidence and that Department Counsel\u2019s questioning\n3\ndeprived him of his right of confrontation under the Directive.  We do not need to address this argument in our resolution\nof Applicant\u2019s due process claim.  However, we have previously held that an Army Criminal Investigation Division ROI\nconstituted an official record within the meaning of Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20.  ISCR Case No. 06-06496 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun.\n25, 2009).  Unlike a DoD personnel background ROI, the CID report was admissible without an authenticating witness.\n4\nSecondly, we conclude that, even if the issue had not been waived, Department Counsel\u2019s\nquestioning of Applicant was not erroneous.  It appears consistent with Federal Rule of Evidence\n613, which permits a party to question a witness on a prior statement, without first disclosing the\ncontents of the statement to the witness.   While the Federal Rules of Evidence serve only as a guide\n2\nin DOHA hearings, the extent to which a party\u2019s conduct of his or her case complies with them\nlessens the force of an opposing party\u2019s objection.  By the same token, we find no basis to conclude\nthat the Judge considered this document for the truth of its contents, or that he even saw it.  Rather,\nhe considered Applicant\u2019s response to Department Counsel\u2019s questions in forming his opinion of\nApplicant\u2019s credibility.  The credibility of an applicant\u2019s hearing testimony is a proper matter for a\nJudge to address in evaluating, inter alia, the applicant\u2019s claims of reform and rehabilitation.  See\nISCR Case No. 04-09959 at 3 (App. Bd. May 19, 2006).  Therefore, we conclude that Department\nCounsel\u2019s questions did not deprive Applicant of the due process afforded by the Directive.  \nRemaining Issues\nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s analysis of the pertinent mitigating conditions and of the\nwhole-person factors was impaired by his alleged consideration of the Army ROI.  However, as\nstated above, there is no basis in the record to conclude that the Judge was aware of the contents of\nthis document beyond what was intimated in Department Counsel\u2019s questioning.  Neither is there\na basis to conclude that he considered the document as substantive evidence.  Therefore, Department\nCounsel\u2019s questions do not provide a reason to disturb the Judge\u2019s analysis of Applicant\u2019s case for\nmitigation.   \n3\n\n5\nApplicant also contends that the Judge misinterpreted some of his testimony.  Specifically,\nhe disagrees with the following comments in the Analysis portion of the decision: \nWhen asked whether he would commit the offenses if he had it to do all over again,\nhe was evasive.  He lacked sincere empathy for the victims, and instead emphasized\nthe impact of the offenses on himself and his family.  Decision at 11.  \nApplicant points to testimony, for example, in which he expresses remorse.  He also explains\nhis apparently equivocal answer to a question about whether he would commit the offenses again\nas simply an acknowledgment that good things, such as having met his wife, can follow on the heels\nof bad things.  However, a Judge is presumed to have considered all the evidence in the record.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 07-00196 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009); ISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (App.\nBd. May 23, 2008).  Applicant has not rebutted that presumption, nor has he demonstrated that the\nJudge mis-weighed the record evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21819 at 2 (App. Bd.

However, as stated above, there is no basis in the record to conclude that the Judge was aware of the contents of this document beyond what was intimated in Department Counsel\u2019s questioning. Neither is there a basis to conclude that he considered the document as substantive evidence. Therefore, Department Counsel\u2019s questions do not provide a reason to disturb the Judge\u2019s analysis of Applicant\u2019s case for mitigation. 3 5 Applicant also contends that the Judge misinterpreted some of his testimony. Specifically, he disagrees with the following comments in the Analysis portion of the decision: When asked whether he would commit the offenses if he had it to do all over again, he was evasive. He lacked sincere empathy for the victims, and instead emphasized the impact of the offenses on himself and his family. Decision at 11. Applicant points to testimony, for example, in which he expresses remorse. He also explains his apparently equivocal answer to a question about whether he would commit the offenses again as simply an acknowledgment that good things, such as having met his wife, can follow on the heels of bad things. However, a Judge is presumed to have considered all the evidence in the record. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-00196 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009); ISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (App. Bd. May 23, 2008).

He has previously held an authorization to occupy a public trust position (Tr. 107). Approval of a security clearance would allow him to work on classified contracts and expand his employment opportunities (Tr. 110-111). He was in the Army from November 1992 to November 1993 (Tr. 122). He received an honorable discharge (Tr. 122-123). He is married, and his children are ages five and ten (Tr. 105, 133). He has worked with other employees with high-level clearances for the last six years (Tr. 111).

Ginsberg, Esquire \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \nHARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate security concerns regarding his sexual behavior and \ncriminal conduct. In January 1994, Applicant was convicted of two felony-level counts in \nU.S. District Court of sexual offenses against children. His crimes cannot be mitigated \nbecause he was not forthright and candid at his hearing concerning his sexual offenses. \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 6, 2008, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions or \nsecurity clearance application (SF-86) (Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On July 9, 2009, \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons \n(SOR) (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as \namended and modified; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as \namended and modified; and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by \nthe President on December 29, 2005.  \nJanuary 15, 2010\n\n \n2                                                                                              \n                                           \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines J (criminal conduct) and D \n(sexual behavior) (HE 1). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the \npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant\u2019s \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn August 5, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR (HE 2). He requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. On August 26, 2009, Department Counsel \nindicated she was ready to proceed on his case. On August 28, 2009, DOHA assigned \nApplicant\u2019s case to me. On September 9, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice (HE 3). \nOn October 21, 2009, Applicant\u2019s hearing was held. At the hearing, Department \nCounsel offered four exhibits (GE 1-4) (Tr. 20), and Applicant did not offer any exhibits \n(Tr. 21). There were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-4 (Tr. 20-21). Additionally, I \nadmitted the hearing notice, SOR, and response to the SOR (HE 1-3). On October 29, \n2009, I received the transcript.   \n \nProcedural Issues1 \n \nApplicant\u2019s case implicated the prohibitions of the Smith Amendment (10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 986), because he was convicted and sentenced to punishments including two years of \nconfinement, and he was confined for more than one year (13 months) (GE 2 at 16). \nHowever, this section of the United States Code, which applied only to clearances \ngranted by DoD, was repealed on January 28, 2008, when the President signed the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 into law. It was replaced by \nadding Sec. 3002 to 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435b (the Bond Amendment), which applies \nthroughout the federal government. Section 3002(c) of this new provision continues the \nrequirement for disqualification, absent a meritorious waiver, for persons who were \nsentenced to and served imprisonment for more than a year. However, this \ndisqualification only applies to prevent clearances that would provide access to special \naccess programs (SAP), restricted data (RD), or any other information commonly \nreferred to as \u201cspecial compartmented information\u201d (SCI). \n \nThe Bond Amendment ends the former Smith Amendment requirement for a \nmeritorious Secretarial waiver to grant or continue a regular, or \u201ccollateral,\u201d security \nclearance to a person who has received a conviction and served over one year of \nconfinement. On June 20, 2008, before the issuance of the SOR and the hearing in this \ncase, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) issued a memorandum providing \ninterim guidance for implementation of the Bond Amendment. This memorandum set \nforth guidance for adjudicators to assess the potential application of the Bond \nAmendment to security clearance determinations and requirements for \u201cException\u201d \nidentification of persons subject to its limitations in the Joint Adjudication Management \nSystem (JAMS) if a collateral clearance is granted. The granting of access to SAP, RD \nor SCI to such individuals requires a meritorious waiver under the terms of that \n \n1Administrative Judge White cogently explained the interplay between the Smith Act, the Bond \nAmendment and revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) J in ISCR Case No. 07-11963 (A.J. Aug. 20, 2008). \nI have borrowed freely and extensively without further citation from his explanation in this section.   \n\n \n3                                                                                              \n                                           \nmemorandum. Such access is not at issue in this case, and accordingly the Bond \nAmendment was not addressed in either the SOR or at the hearing. \n \nThe repeal of the Smith Amendment also nullified the legal authority by which the \nUnder Secretary of Defense for Intelligence modified the revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG) that were approved by the President on December 29, 2005. When the \nUnder Secretary promulgated the AG for use within DoD, on August 30, 2006, he added \nprovisions reflecting the Smith Amendment. AG H (Drug Involvement), AG I \n(Psychological Conditions), and AG J (Criminal Conduct) were each modified, but only \nthe latter guideline is involved in this case. It was modified by adding AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(f), 32(e), \nand footnotes 1 and 2. Because the President, in Executive Order 12968, intended to \nestablish \u201ca uniform Federal personnel security program\u201d (Intro.), and required a \n\u201ccommon set of adjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility for access to classified \ninformation\u201d (Sec. 3.1(f).), the authority for these DoD modifications to the guidelines \nended with the repeal of the Smith Amendment. The new statutory requirements are in \neffect and must be followed pending formal revision of the AG, but only the prohibition \nagainst granting clearances to unlawful drug users and addicts under AG H applies to \n\u201ccollateral\u201d security clearances. Accordingly, the Smith Amendment-related provisions \nadded to AG J have been repealed, and do not apply to the remaining proceedings in \nthis case.     \n \nFindings of Fact2 \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations (HE 2). His admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old systems engineer employed by a defense contractor \n(Tr. 106; GE 1). He has previously held an authorization to occupy a public trust position \n(Tr. 107). Approval of a security clearance would allow him to work on classified \ncontracts and expand his employment opportunities (Tr. 110-111). He was in the Army \nfrom November 1992 to November 1993 (Tr. 122). He received an honorable discharge \n(Tr. 122-123). He is married, and his children are ages five and ten (Tr. 105, 133). He \nhas worked with other employees with high-level clearances for the last six years (Tr. \n111). On one occasion, he observed unsecure classified information, and he reported \nthe security violation to his facility security officer (Tr. 111). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father deserted his family when Applicant was nine years old (Tr. 26). \nApplicant\u2019s mother and older sister lived in his household until his mother re-married \nwhen Applicant was 12 (Tr. 26-27, 74). Applicant had problems in school and had to \nrepeat the third grade (Tr. 27). He had a difficult, troubled childhood (Tr. 27). When \nApplicant was an adolescent, he was depressed and sometimes suicidal (Tr. 27). \nApplicant was seen by therapists for about six years (Tr. 27). \n \n \n2Some details were not included to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific information is \navailable in the cited exhibits.   \n \n\n \n4                                                                                              \n                                           \nCriminal Conduct \n   \n \nWhen Applicant was a junior in high school, he began receiving the assistance of \na tutor for his standard aptitude test (SAT) (Tr. 30, 99). His tutor was married to an Army \nofficer, and his tutor\u2019s family lived on a military installation (Tr. 30). His tutor was in a \nserious car accident, and she used a wheel chair for mobility (Tr. 30, 99). Applicant \ncontinued to have a relationship with his tutor\u2019s family through his senior year of high \nschool, and during the summer of 1992, after he graduated from high school (Tr. 118). \nHis tutor\u2019s family entrusted Applicant to provide child care for their 12-year-old daughter \n(Tr. 30, 99). \n \n \nApplicant admitted that from August to October 1992 when he was 19 years old, \nhe engaged in about ten sexual acts with one 12-year-old child and about two sexual \nacts with another 12-year-old child (Tr. 114-115, 124). He digitally penetrated the vagina \nof one child and fondled her breasts, and he kissed and fondled the other child\u2019s breasts \n(Tr. 141, 144). Applicant made the following responses to questions at the hearing: \n \nQ: Well, going in the other direction, did she fondle your penis or put your \npenis in the mouth or anything like that? \n \nAns: Not that I recall, no. I don\u2019t believe so. I can tell you right now, there \nwas no oral sex. My penis never left my pants. I don\u2019t believe that \nshe ever fondled my penis, but I \u2013 I really try hard to forget that. I \ncan\u2019t say accurately, whether it did. It may have. I don\u2019t completely \u2013 I \ncan\u2019t say truthfully, whether it did or didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t believe it did, but \nagain, I spent the last 15 years of my life, trying to purge those \nmemories from my brain.  .  .  . \n \nQ: You did have the girls masturbate you, correct? \n \nAns: No, I don\u2019t believe so. They may have fondled me \u2013the one girl may \nhave fondled me, but I \u2014 honestly, this is part of the problem I had in \n2005, is a lot of this stuff, because of what it did and what I went \nthrough with my childhood, I\u2019ve tried to repress a lot of the stuff and \nthey had \u2014 it took a long time to get to that\u2014that memory to come \nback from the depths of my brain.3   \n   \nApplicant was a temporary caretaker4 of the child he molested to the greater \ndegree (Tr. 115, 124, 140). Applicant did not continue the sexual abuse after he went on \nactive duty in the Army (Tr. 115). He knew what he did to the children was wrong (Tr. \n116, 119). However, he denied knowledge or awareness that he knew at the time of the \noffenses his sexual contacts with the children were illegal (Tr. 116, 119). He denied \n \n3 Tr. 141-142. \n \n4 Applicant said he was in a position of trust as he was alone with the children and he was \nsupposed to \u201ckeep an eye on them\u201d (Tr. 140). However, he disputed that he was \u201cbabysitting for them\u201d \n(Tr. 140).  \n\n \n5                                                                                              \n                                           \nawareness of the law concerning age of consent to sexual activity (Tr. 117, 119). Now \nhe knows about the age of consent, and other legal limitations on sexual relationships \n(Tr. 117-118). When he committed the offenses, he was most concerned about the \nchild\u2019s father finding out about what he was doing and had done (Tr. 121). \n \nAbout eight months after he went on active duty in the Army, the FBI questioned \nhim (Tr. 28, 100). He did not want to contest the case because he did not want to \nsubject the children to re-living the experience of the sexual abuse during a court \nappearance (Tr. 101). In November 1993, he pleaded guilty and was convicted of one \ncount of engaging in a sexual act with a minor between the age of 12 and 16 who was \nat least four years younger than the Applicant, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243, and one \ncount of engaging in sexual contact with a minor between the ages of 12 and 16 who \nwas at least four years younger than the defendant, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 (GE \n2 at 4, 7). In January 1994, he was sentenced to concurrent terms of 15 months \nimprisonment on each count, and a three-year term of supervised release (Tr. 104; GE \n2 at 4, 7-12). Applicant was released from jail after serving 13 months of his sentence \n(GE 2 at 4).  \n \n \nApplicant regrets his conduct (Tr. 100). He knew what he had done was wrong \n(Tr. 101). Department Counsel asked Applicant whether he would commit the offenses \nagain and Applicant replied: \n \nI\u2019m kind of torn, because I believe in, every action has a reaction and if I \ngo back and say \u2018I wouldn\u2019t do that again,\u2019 I wouldn\u2019t have met my wife, I \nwouldn\u2019t have two kids, I wouldn\u2019t be in the position I\u2019m sitting [in] right \nnow. But I\u2019m extremely remorseful. I know firsthand, what it\u2019s like to be in \nthat situation that I put those two girls in, and it wasn\u2019t until the evaluations \nwith the [ ] sex offender [ ] treatment providers for me trying to be \nreclassified [from being registered as a violent sexual offender] that [I \nlearned] it was a psychological thing and in fact, one of the doctors I talked \nto said the fact that this happened to me at about age 11, 12, 13, mentally, \nmy mind went back to that, when I was with these girls.5  \n \n He admitted that the children could not consent, and that he violated their trust (Tr. 99-\n100, 145). He accepted what he learned through therapy that he caused the two \nchildren harm (Tr. 116). He reiterated that he was very remorseful about his conduct \n(Tr. 115, 120). \n   \n \nDr. C, a psychiatrist, made a lengthy statement on Applicant\u2019s behalf (Tr. 24-73). \nDr. C has had a psychiatric practice since 1972 (Tr. 24). Dr. C has provided treatment \nfor some highly sensitive CIA patients over the years (Tr. 25, 49-50). None of them were \nsimilar to Applicant\u2019s case (Tr. 50). He is familiar with security clearance requirements \nand procedures (Tr. 24-25).  \n \n \n5 Tr. 116-117. \n \n\n \n6                                                                                              \n                                           \nDr. C provided the only therapy and counseling that Applicant received after his \nrelease from jail (Tr. 128). Applicant did not seek out more therapy because he did not \nsee himself as the type of person who would sexually molest children (Tr. 128). Dr. C \nhas been seeing Applicant periodically as a patient since 1990 (Tr. 25). The first series \nof 28 treatments involved visits about once a week and lasted about a year (Tr. 25, 45-\n46). Then Dr. C did not see Applicant for about 18 months. From 1993 to 1994, he saw \nApplicant again for two to four visits (Tr. 25, 45). Dr. C did not review any police reports \nabout Applicant\u2019s offenses (Tr. 64, 72). He never asked Applicant to provide any details \nabout the offenses (Tr. 72). He wrote a letter on Applicant\u2019s behalf in January 1994 (Tr. \n45; GE 2 at 13-14). Applicant received some counseling while in jail (Tr. 46).  \n \n \nDr. C attributed Applicant\u2019s sexual offenses in part to Applicant\u2019s sister\u2019s6 sexual \nabuse of Applicant when he was 11 to 13 years of age (Tr. 29, 121). Applicant was \nangry about the absence of his father from his life when he was a child (Tr. 29). Dr. C \nnoted that the parents that took Applicant into their home when he was a senior in high \nschool were nice to him, and he repaid them by molesting their child (Tr. 62). He was \nsubconsciously trying to hurt the children\u2019s father because he was injured by his own \nfather (Tr. 63, 70). Applicant\u2019s own emotional immaturity also had a role in the offense \n(Tr. 30-31). When Applicant sexually molested the children, he was chronologically 19 \nyears old and emotionally 15 years old (Tr. 30-31, 52). Dr. C described Applicant\u2019s \nsexual activity as \u201cexploratory\u201d (Tr. 31, 52). However, he conceded that Applicant knew \nwhat he was doing was wrong and probably illegal (Tr. 61).  \n \n \nAfter Applicant went into the Army, he became more emotionally mature and has \nnot shown any interest in underage girls (Tr. 32). Dr. C described Applicant\u2019s \nmisconduct as a \u201cquirky, unfortunate thing\u201d (Tr. 32). Applicant received some therapy \nwhile he was in jail (Tr. 103). He was held in three different facilities (Tr. 104). One of \nhis transfers was due to an inmate\u2019s threat to harm Applicant because of the nature of \nhis conviction as a child sexual offender (Tr. 104).    \n  \n \nPsychological testing indicates that Applicant was at the very lowest level of risk \nfor repeating any sexual offenses (Tr. 35, 39). He disagreed with the 2006 report of a \nsocial worker that described Applicant as an \u201cextremely socially immature, irresponsible \nman whose coping skills and social judgment are poorly developed.  .  .  . He appears to \nlack insight, hence has little awareness of how his behavior impacts others\u201d (Tr. 53-54). \nDr. C thought this part of the social worker\u2019s report was unreliable \u201cboilerplate that was \nkicked out by some computer\u201d (Tr. 54). Applicant scored high on the incest scale in the \nsevere problem range; however, Dr. C believed this result was caused by Applicant \nbeing sensitized to sexual material involving adolescents through the testing process \n(Tr. 55-59, 65).7 The tests showed Applicant had sexual interest in adolescent females \nages 14 to 17 as well as sexual interest in adult females (Tr. 59, 66). Dr. C considered \nthis sexual interest to be normal (Tr. 59, 66). On another test, he scored low in interest \n \n6 Applicant\u2019s older sister also used illegal drugs (Tr. 28). \n \n7 Applicant explained the tests \u201csparked up a lot of raw emotion in me and made me re-live a lot \nof the stuff.  .  .  . I essentially came out of the room crying because it [was] just rather disturbing\u201d (Tr. \n140). \n\n \n7                                                                                              \ntowards heterosexual incest, pedophilia, and rape (Tr. 67). Dr. C opined that Applicant \ndid not have a personality disorder (Tr. 39). He agreed with the social workers, who \nreported Applicant had a low risk of re-offending and was unlikely to commit future \nsexual offenses (Tr. 39, 60). Dr. C believes Applicant has a law-abiding character (Tr. \n43).  \nDr. C counseled Applicant twice in the summer of 2009 (Tr. 44). Applicant started \nseeing Dr. C again in 2009 because he wanted some help in how to reveal his sexual \noffender history to his children (Tr. 105). Applicant was concerned that the neighbors of \nhis children will discover he is a registered sexual offender (Tr. 48). Applicant did not \nwant his children to learn from other children that they could not play with Applicant\u2019s \nchildren because Applicant was \u201ca bad person\u201d (Tr. 127). He is worried about the impact \nof this information on his children (Tr. 48). Dr. C believed Applicant\u2019s concerns about his \nchildren are reasonable (Tr. 68). He considered divorce to conceal his connection to his \nchildren (Tr. 112-113). He explained: \n \nThe only people I\u2019m concerned with [about] adverse effects are my two \nkids, because they\u2019re my life and my soul. They\u2019re the reason I do what I \ndo and again, it sucks that they have to be put in a situation where my \npast is affecting their livelihood and if there was a way I could do \nsomething to mitigate that, I\u2019d do it in a heartbeat.  .  .  . I mean, we go to \ngreat lengths to kind of shield them from the repercussions, but at some \ntime, it\u2019s going to come out and I\u2019m hoping that it\u2019s later on down the road, \nbut I\u2019m preparing for it to be rather soon. (Tr. 112-114).    \n \nDr. C provided a positive diagnosis and prognosis. He believes Applicant\u2019s \nemotional age is now the same as his chronological age (Tr. 52). He has a mature, \nbalanced, and appropriate relationship with his spouse and two children (Tr. 42). \nApplicant has a proper level of integrity, reliability, and trustworthiness (Tr. 41). He is \nfully capable of protecting classified information (Tr. 41).   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s step-father was the president of a company that provided security-\nrelated electronic equipment to prominent persons for 30 years (Tr. 75). He has \npreviously held a security clearance (Tr. 75). He has known Appellant for 23 years (Tr. \n74). Before Applicant joined the Army he was immature (Tr. 77). Applicant had the trust \nof the family that took him in, and he abused that trust (Tr. 93). When he was charged, \nhe admitted he did the misconduct (Tr. 78). His step-father advised Applicant to admit to \nthe court what he had done and to throw himself on the mercy of the court (Tr. 94).  \n \nApplicant does not try to actively hide his criminal history (Tr. 82, 84). He has \nbeen forthright with his employers (Tr. 85). His step-father believes Applicant has solid \nintegrity and honesty (Tr. 97). His step-father opined that Applicant is careful to abide by \nthe law, and he can be trusted with classified information (Tr. 81, 86).  \n \nRegistration as a violent sexual offender and residence limitations \n \nApplicant and his wife purchased a residence within 300 feet of a school (Tr. 79, \n95, 108). In 2001, the state law changed and Applicant was required to re-register as a \n\u201csexually violent offender\u201d every 90 days for life (GE 2 at 38). As a registered violent \n\n \n8                                                                                              \n                                           \nsexual offender, he could not live within 500 feet of a school (Tr. 79-80, 108). He was \nunable to sell his home because the value of the home is less than his mortgage (Tr. \n108-109). Applicant has lived with his mother and his step-father for the last five years \n(Tr. 78-80, 85-87). He spends a considerable amount of time with his wife and children; \nhowever, he usually stays overnight in his mother and step-father\u2019s residence (Tr. 88-\n89, 109). When his wife travels out of town, Applicant stays with his children. The state \nand county police are aware of this arrangement and have not arrested Applicant for \nnon-compliance with residence requirements for registered violent sexual offenders (Tr. \n90, 95, 109).8  \n \nApplicant\u2019s manager, supervisors, and some peers at work know about his \nregistration on the sexual abuse registry (Tr. 102, 131-132). When questioned by \nfriends or colleagues, he explains it happened before he served in the military (Tr. 131). \nHe was 19 and the girls were more than four years younger than he was (Tr. 131). He \ndoes not provide specifics about what he did to the children (Tr. 130-131). He was \nworried that his children would be traumatized if another child said his or her parents \nwould not let them go over to Applicant\u2019s house because their father is a sex offender \n(Tr. 102).  \n \nApplicant has complied with requirements for registration as a sexual offender \n(Tr. 35-36). See SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b (listing Applicant\u2019s registration as a violent sex offender). \nBecause his offense is a public record, he is unlikely to try to conceal it (Tr. 40).9 \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \n \n8 Applicant was concerned because state law does not define primary residence; however, he \nsaid the police knew about how much time he spent with his children at their home (Tr. 135-136). \nApplicant \u201cspends as much time as humanly possible\u201d with his children\u201d (Tr. 136-137). Evidently, there is \nsome variance about how frequently he stays overnight with his children, depending on when his spouse \ngoes out of town for work (Tr. 134-137).      \n \n9At the hearing, I accepted as fact without additional post-hearing evidence that Applicant\u2019s \nemployer, supervisors, and colleagues were aware of his conviction and registration as a violent sexual \noffender. Further, I am convinced he would not succumb to extortion to avoid further disclosure of his \noffenses because such information is readily available on the internet, and as part of the public record (Tr. \n152). He is well aware that eventually his children will learn of his sexual crimes.    \n\n \n9                                                                                              \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the relevant security concern is under Guidelines J (criminal conduct) \nand D (sexual behavior).   \n\n \n10                                                                                             \n \nCriminal Conduct, Guideline J \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nnature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules \nand regulations.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and  \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \n \nAGs \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(c) apply because in January 1994, Applicant was convicted \nof two felony-level counts of sexual abuse of a minor, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243 \nand abusive sexual contact, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244. He admitted that he \ncommitted the two felonies. He was sentenced to 15 months incarceration, fines, and \nsupervised release for three years. He served 13 months in jail.   \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides four conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(b) and 32(c) clearly do not \napply because Applicant admitted the offenses and no one pressured him into \ncommitting the offenses. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) are similar and partially applicable. \nApplicant's last offense resulting in a conviction occurred in about October 1992, more \nthan 17 years ago. He served his incarceration and paid his fines. He presented strong \nevidence of remorse, job training, a good employment record, and support from his \npsychiatrist, social workers, spouse, and father-in-law. A fairly lengthy period has \nelapsed to contemplate his poor judgment and to respond to therapy. The therapy he \nreceived is particularly noteworthy because Dr. C\u2019s services were not court ordered, and \n\n \n11                                                                                             \nApplicant funded Dr. C\u2019s therapy. This therapy and counseling has had a significant \nsalutary effect. He understands his criminal offenses had a devastating impact on his \nlifestyle, family, and career. His demonstrated intent not to commit future crimes is \nencompassed in these two mitigating conditions. He has worked for the same employer \nfor several years and has a good employment record. He accepted some responsibility \nand culpability.  \n \nNotwithstanding these positive attributes, more progress is necessary to assure \nApplicant has the improved reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment necessary to \nsafeguard classified information. When asked about whether the victims touched his \npenis, Applicant was not credible when he denied that he knew whether they did or not. \nHis failure to be fully candid and forthright about a material matter at his security \nclearance hearing shows poor judgment and militates against approval of a security \nclearance. He also emphasized that he was a victim of his older sister\u2019s sexual abuse \nand had his own psychological issues. When asked whether he would commit the \noffenses if he had it to do all over again, he was evasive. He lacked sincere empathy for \nthe victims, and instead emphasized the impact of the offenses on himself and his \nfamily. He did not want to accept full responsibility for making the choices that led to his \nconviction.   \n \nSexual Behavior, Guideline D \n \nAG \u00b6 12 describes the concern about sexual behavior stating: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or \nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may \nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or \nduress can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness \nand ability to protect classified information .  .  .  .  \n \nAG \u00b6 13 provides four conditions relating to sexual behavior that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying: \n \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n \n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual behavior \nthat the person is unable to stop or that may be symptomatic of a \npersonality disorder; \n \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion \nor judgment. \n \nApplicant admitted that he sexually abused two 12-year-old children. He was \nconvicted of two felonies. It does not make him vulnerable to coercion because he has \n\n \n12                                                                                             \nbeen open to his spouse, father-in-law, employer, and others about his offense. He is a \nregistered violent sex offender and his conduct is readily discoverable on the internet. \nApplicant has stopped his criminal, sexual behavior. AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(b) and 13(c) do not \napply; however, AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a) and 13(d) apply.     \n \nAG \u00b6 14 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and \n \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet. \n  \n \nApplicant committed the offenses when he was 19 years old. The Directive does \nnot define \u201cadolescence\u201d in chronological terms, and Applicant was emotionally \nimmature. AG \u00b6 14(a) applies because Applicant was still an emotional adolescent \nwhen the committed the sexual crimes. In regard to the issue of whether the sexual \noffenses were recent, they occurred in about October 1992, which is more than 17 \nyears ago. He has served his incarceration and received extensive therapy. He has not \ncommitted any sexual crimes in the last 17 years. However, Applicant described years \nof sexual abuse by his older sister. There is still a possibility of recurrence and AG \u00b6 \n14(b) can only be partially applied. As indicated previously, the behavior no longer \nserves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress and AG \u00b6 14(c) applies. Applicant \nsexually abused two 12-year-old children. The minors could not legally consent to the \nsexual activity and AG \u00b6 14(d) does not apply. However, the \u201cWhole Person Concept,\u201d \ninfra, elaborates on whether Sexual Behavior under Guideline D can be mitigated under \nall of the circumstances.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n13                                                                                             \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines J and D in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nThere is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant\u2019s access to sensitive \ninformation. In October 1992, Applicant was 19 years old when he committed the sexual \noffenses with two minors. Moreover, he was emotionally immature for his age. AG \u00b6 \n14(a) characterizes a person as an \u201cadolescent\u201d rather than using a particular \nchronological age to permit factors such as emotional age to be relevant to mitigation.  \nDr. C described Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior with two 12-year-old children as \n\u201cexploratory\u201d rather than manifesting a fixated orientation towards children. Applicant \nhas not committed any sexual offenses since his crimes in 1992. He admitted his two \nfelonies to his employer, psychiatrist, security officials, law enforcement, step father, \nand spouse. He is registered on the internet as a sexually violent offender, and there is \nno possibility he could be coerced into revealing classified information because of the \npublic nature of this information. He knows the consequences of offenses. He \ncompleted his incarceration and paid his fines. He has received years of counseling, \nproviding important mitigation of his sexual offenses. Applicant significantly contributes \nto his company and the Department of Defense. There is no evidence at work of any \ndisciplinary problems. There is no evidence of disloyalty or that he would intentionally \nviolate national security. His character and good work performance show some \nresponsibility, rehabilitation and mitigation. His employer supports his access to \nclassified information as indicated by sponsoring him for a security clearance.   \n \nThe evidence against approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial.  \nApplicant was sexually abused by his older sister. In turn, when he was 19, he sexually \nabused two minors, who were only 12-years-old. At the age of 19, he was an adult and \nlegally responsible for his criminal conduct under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2243 and 2244. \nApplicant abused them knowing the devastating impact his older sister\u2019s sexual contact \nhad on himself.  \n \nThe most important reason for denying his security clearance is Applicant\u2019s lack \nof credibility. At his security clearance hearing he was evasive about remembering \nwhether the children had touched his penis, or not. He failed to candidly take full \nresponsibility for what he had done to the children. His sexual misconduct was a \ncritically important event in his life, and his claimed lack of memory or evasive \ncomments or both (quoted at page 4, supra, about whether the children touched his \npenis) are not fully truthful. At age 36, he was sufficiently mature to be fully responsible \nfor his knowing that he had to be truthful, candid, and forthright at his security clearance \nhearing.  \n \nThe sexual offenses in 1992 must be considered in combination with Applicant\u2019s \nstatement at his hearing on October 21, 2009. His conduct in 1992, and in 2009, shows \n\n \n14                                                                                             \n                                           \na lack of judgment and raises a serious security concern. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the security concerns \npertaining to sexual behavior and criminal conduct.  His access to classified information \nis not justified.  \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d10 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline D:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nMark W. Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n \n10See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 12, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under \nGuidelines B and C, Foreign Influence and Foreign Preference. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense (DoD) \nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nOctober 13, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 28, 2009, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on July 2, 2009. DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on July 16, 2009, scheduling the hearing for August 5, 2009. The \nhearing was convened as scheduled. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) \non August 13, 2009.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nNotice \n \nI advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice \nbefore the hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice.   \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a written request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts about Iran. Applicant did not object and the request was approved. The \nrequest and the attached documents were not admitted into evidence but were included \nin the record as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. The facts administratively noticed are set out in \nthe Findings of Fact, below.   \n \nEvidence \n \nThe government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were received without \nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, called two witnesses, and submitted \nExhibits (AE) A through U, which were received without objection. The record was held \nopen for Applicant to submit additional information. Applicant submitted three \ndocuments, which were marked AE V through X and admitted without objection. \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s memorandum is marked HE II. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old engineer for a defense contractor. He is applying for \nhis first security clearance. He is single and has no children. He was born in Kuwait. His \nparents were Iranian citizens living in Kuwait. Applicant has never lived in Iran, but as a \nchild he would visit Iran with his family during his summer vacations. He attended an \nIranian school in Kuwait until he was 11 years old, at which time he entered an English \nlanguage school. English became his primary language. He cannot read or write Farsi \nand is not fluent speaking the language.1  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents brought him and his four siblings to the United States in the \nlate 1980s. One of his siblings required medical attention for a rare genetic disorder. His \nfather returned to Kuwait to attend to his business, but the rest of the family remained in \nthe U.S. Applicant was enrolled in high school. He graduated high school with a high \ngrade point average and numerous awards. He attended community college before \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 22-26, 32, 35-39, 71, 73, 107-109, 140; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE A, B. \n \n\n \n3 \n \ntransferring to a four-year university. He graduated with honors and obtained his \nbachelor\u2019s degree.2  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father was openly critical of the Iranian government. When Iraq \ninvaded Kuwait in 1990, he went to Iran to avoid the Iraqi army. Because of his political \nopinions and outspoken criticism of the Iranian government, he was detained and \nincarcerated in Iran. His family lost touch with him for several years. His business in \nKuwait was looted and destroyed by the Iraqi army. Applicant has had very limited \ncontact with his father since Applicant came to live in the U.S.3 \n \n \nApplicant and the remainder of his family applied for political asylum in the U.S. \nin the early 1990s. They were denied asylum but were granted permanent resident \nstatus. Applicant became a U.S. citizen in 2006, and received a U.S. passport shortly \nthereafter.4 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s four siblings are all U.S. citizens and residents. His mother is also a \nU.S. citizen. As discussed below, U.S. citizens who were born in Iran and the children of \nIranian citizens are considered Iranian citizens by Iranian authorities. Under Iranian law, \nApplicant, his mother, and his siblings are considered Iranian citizens. All of his siblings \nare college graduates living in the same state as Applicant. Two of his siblings are \nmarried to U.S. citizens. One of his married siblings has a child who was born in the \nU.S.5 \n \n \nApplicant traveled to Kuwait in 2007. His mother met him in Kuwait a few weeks \nlater. Applicant met his father in Kuwait by happenstance. His father divides his time \nliving in Kuwait and Iran. His father was living in a house that required a lot of repairs. \nApplicant, although not close to his father, worked on his father\u2019s house for about three \nmonths. Applicant paid for many of the repairs on the house.6   \n \n \nAfter several months in Kuwait, Applicant traveled with his mother to Iran to visit \nextended family, sightsee, and for his mother to check on the status of her assets in \nIran. He used his Iranian passport to enter Iran. Upon entry to Iran, Applicant was \nrequired to complete paperwork to establish his exemption from Iranian military service. \nWhile in Iran, Applicant was informed that his entry/exit permit had expired. He was \nunaware before then that he needed an entry/exit permit before he could depart Iran. \nHe was told that he could obtain a one-way temporary permit to leave Iran if he filed the \nappropriate application forms. The application required his military exemption card and \nhis Iranian passport. When he submitted his application, he was informed that his \n                                                          \n2 Tr. at 26-35, 40-41, 48-49; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE C-H. \n \n3 Tr. at 23, 111-113, 131; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2. \n \n4 Tr. at 32-34, 113, 132-134; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3; AE I. \n \n5 Tr. at 42-44; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2. \n \n6 Tr. at 61-70, 96-97, 109-110, 113-118, 126; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3; AE P. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nIranian passport needed to be replaced with a new passport. He applied for and \nreceived a new Iranian passport.7  \n \n \nApplicant and his mother stayed at his mother\u2019s house while they were in Iran. \nHis cousin, who is a citizen and resident of Iran, stayed with them while they were in \nIran. Applicant and his mother left Iran for about two weeks to visit another country and \nthen returned to Iran. Their total time in Iran was about five months. Their stay in Iran \nwas extended to attend a wedding of a cousin and a funeral of a distant relative. \nApplicant was briefed and debriefed by his facility security officer (FSO) before and after \nhis trip.8  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother has been involved in an extended legal dispute with her \nbrother over property in Iran. The assets in the dispute are valued at about $1,000,000. \nThe brother forged some documents to essentially steal her property. Applicant saw \nsome of his uncle\u2019s actions and is a potential witness in the legal case. Applicant\u2019s \nmother has been in Iran for more than a year working on her case. She was still in Iran \nat the close of the record, but hoped to permanently return to the U.S. as soon as \npossible.9   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s cousin has continued to assist Applicant\u2019s mother while she is in Iran, \nwith things such as driving her to see her lawyer and to get her groceries. He is \ninterested in the possibility of a relationship with Applicant\u2019s youngest sister. Applicant \ndoes not believe the potential relationship will develop because of the large cultural and \nlanguage differences between his sister and his cousin.10 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s grandmother is a citizen and resident of Iran. Applicant does not have \ncontact with his grandmother because she has taken his uncle\u2019s side in the legal \ndispute with his mother.11 \n \n \nApplicant has other extended family members who are citizens of and residents \nin Iran. He is not close to any of them. None of Applicant\u2019s family members have any \ndirect connection to the government of Iran.12  \n \n \nApplicant initially indicated that he was keeping his Iranian passport so that he \ncould travel to Iran to be a witness in his mother\u2019s legal case. He decided not to keep \nthe passport. The Iranian passport was given to his FSO, who destroyed it on August 5, \n                                                          \n7 Tr. at 70-76; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3; AE S, U. \n \n8 Tr. at 71-72, 76, 98, 121-124, 144; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3; AE O, T. \n \n9 Tr. at 76-93, 127-128; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3; AE Q, R, V-X. \n \n10 Tr. at 99-104, 126-127; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR. \n \n11 Tr. at 97-98, 125; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1. \n \n12 Tr. at 104-106, 125-127; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n2009. Applicant has no desire to return to Iran. He is willing to renounce his Iranian \ncitizenship.13 \n \n \nApplicant does not own any foreign assets. He has transferred a potential interest \nin a property inherited by him and his siblings to his mother. He has done well financially \nand has substantial assets in the U.S.14  \n \n \nTwo witnesses, including the FSO and a senior executive at Applicant\u2019s \ncompany, testified on his behalf. Numerous character letters and commendatory \nmaterial were also submitted. Applicant is described as an outstanding engineer, \nhonest, trustworthy, intelligent, capable, dependable, dedicated, hardworking, loyal, \nresponsible, and a man of integrity. He is considered a good citizen, who is very loyal to \nthe United States. He is highly recommended for a security clearance.15 \n \nIran \n \n \nIran is a constitutional Islamic republic with a theocratic system of government in \nwhich Shi\u2019a Muslim clergy dominate the key power structures, and ultimate political \nauthority is vested in a learned religious scholar. The U.S. has not had diplomatic \nrelations with Iran since 1980. In 2008, President Bush stated that \u201c[t]he actions and \npolicies of the Government of Iran are contrary to the interests of the United States in \nthe region and pose a continuing unusual and extraordinary threat to the national \nsecurity, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.\u201d The United States has \ndefined the areas of objectionable Iranian behavior as: \n \n \n\u2022 Iran\u2019s efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass \ndestruction (WMD);  \n\u2022 Its support for and involvement in international terrorism; \n\u2022 Its support for violent opposition to the Middle East peace process; and \n\u2022 Its dismal human rights record. \n \n \nThe U.S. has designated and characterized Iran as the world\u2019s leading state \nsponsor of terrorism. Iran provides critical support to non-state terrorist groups. Iran has \nsought to make the United States suffer political, economic, and human costs. Further, \nIran has engaged in efforts to sow violence and undermine stability in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, including lethal support for groups that are directly responsible for \nhundreds of U.S. casualties. \n \n \nThe government of Iran has committed numerous, serious human rights abuses \nagainst the Iranian people. Abuses include political killings and incarceration; summary \nexecutions, including of minors; disappearances; religious persecution; torture; arbitrary \n                                                          \n13 Tr. at 81-83, 93-96, 129, 136-137, 145-155; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2; AE U-X. \n \n14 Tr. at 59-60, 106-107, 129-131; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE N. \n \n15 Tr. at 141-160; AE J-M. \n \n\n \n6 \n \narrest and detention, including prolonged solitary confinement; denial of due process; \nsevere restrictions on civil liberties - speech, press, assembly, association, movement \nand privacy; severe restrictions on freedom of religion; official corruption; violence and \nlegal and societal discrimination against women, ethnic and religious minorities, and \nhomosexuals; trafficking in persons; and child labor.  \n \n \nThe State Department continues to warn U.S. citizens to consider carefully the \nrisks of travel to Iran. U.S. citizens who were born in Iran and the children of Iranian \ncitizens, even those without Iranian passports who do not consider themselves Iranian, \nare considered Iranian citizens by Iranian authorities, since Iran does not recognize dual \ncitizenship. Therefore, despite the fact that these individuals hold U.S. citizenship, under \nIranian law, they must enter and exit Iran on an Iranian passport, unless the Iranian \ngovernment has recognized a formal renunciation or loss of Iranian citizenship. U.S.-\nIranian dual nationals have been denied permission to enter/depart Iran using their U.S. \npassport; they even had their U.S. passports confiscated upon arrival or departure. \nU.S.-Iranian dual citizens have been detained and harassed by the Iranian government. \nIranian security personnel may place foreign visitors under surveillance. Hotel rooms, \ntelephones and fax machines may be monitored, and personal possessions in hotel \nrooms may be searched. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n\n \n7 \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in \nAG \u00b6 9: \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 10. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember. This includes but is not limited to: \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport; and \n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an \nAmerican citizen. \n \nApplicant possessed and used an Iranian passport while a U.S. citizen. AG \u00b6 \n10(a) applied at one point. The renewal of his Iranian passport while a U.S. citizen could \nraise concerns under AG \u00b6 10(b), as an action to obtain recognition of his Iranian \ncitizenship.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \nConditions that could mitigate Foreign Preference security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 11. Three are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; and \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated. \n \n \nIran continued to consider Applicant an Iranian citizen after he was naturalized as \na U.S. citizen. As such, he was required to use an Iranian passport to enter Iran. He has \nsurrendered the passport to his company\u2019s FSO, who destroyed it. To the extent that \nIran considers him an Iranian citizen, he is willing to renounce that citizenship. AG \u00b6 \n11(a) is partially applicable. AG \u00b6\u00b6 11(b) and (e) are applicable. \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 7: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information;  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n(i) conduct, especially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make \nthe individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign \nperson, group, government, or country. \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s grandmother, cousin, and extended family members are citizens of \nand residents in Iran, a country that is clearly hostile to the United States.16 His father is \na citizen of Iran and divides his time living in Kuwait and Iran. His mother is a dual \ncitizen of Iran and the United States. She lives permanently in the United States, but \nhas been in Iran for more than a year. Iran is considered the world\u2019s leading state \nsponsor of terrorism, and the government of Iran has committed numerous, serious \nhuman rights abuses against its people. His family members\u2019 presence in Iran creates a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and \ncoercion. It also creates a potential conflict of interest. Applicant\u2019s travel to Iran and \ninteraction with the government of Iran made him vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, \nand coercion by the Iranian government. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(i) have been raised by \nthe evidence.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate Foreign Influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \n \nApplicant was an Iranian citizen by birth, but he was born and raised in Kuwait. \nHe has been in the United States for more than 20 years and has been a U.S. citizen \nsince 2006. He is not close to his cousin and extended family in Iran. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b), \nand 8(c) are applicable to the security concerns related to those family members. He is \ncurrently estranged from his grandmother because of her siding with his uncle in the \nproperty dispute with his mother. The familial bonds with the uncle are almost certainly \nirrevocably severed. However, the dispute with the grandmother is more likely to be \n                                                          \n16 ISCR Case No. 05-03250 at 5 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2007). \n\n \n10 \n \nresolved. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c) are partially applicable to the security concerns \nrelated to Applicant\u2019s grandmother. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s Iranian passport was destroyed. He is no longer vulnerable to \nexploitation, pressure, and coercion by the Iranian government because of his 2007 trip \nto Iran. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c) are applicable to the security concerns related to that \ntrip.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a dual citizen of the United States and Iran. She has been \nin Iran for more than a year fighting an extensive legal case over more than $1,000,000 \nin assets. His father is a citizen of Iran and splits his time between living in Kuwait and \nIran. Applicant and his father have not been close in many years because of their \nseparation. Applicant chose to spend three months laboring and spending his own \nmoney on his father\u2019s house in Kuwait. They may not be close, but there are still some \nties of obligation. Applicant is clearly a loyal U.S. citizen with no allegiance to the \ngovernment of Iran. However, because of his close family ties to Iran and the nature of \nthe government of Iran, I am unable to find any of the mitigating conditions to be fully \napplicable to the security concerns related to his mother and father.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines C and B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant was born and raised in Kuwait to Iranian parents. He has been in the United \nStates for more than 20 years and has been a U.S. citizen since 2006. He and his \nsiblings have thrived in this country. He is highly regarded personally and professionally.  \n \n\n \n11 \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Iran, a country that is clearly \nhostile to the United States, and the heavy burden an applicant carries when he or she \nhas family members in a hostile country. The nature of a nation\u2019s government, its \nrelationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are relevant in assessing the \nlikelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country \nhas an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent \nupon the government, the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against \nthe United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism. Iran is the \nworld\u2019s leading state sponsor of terrorism and has a dismal human rights record. \nApplicant\u2019s mother is currently in Iran, and his father splits his time between Iran and \nKuwait. Applicant is obviously an intelligent, honest, trustworthy, and loyal U.S. citizen. \nUnfortunately, through no fault of his own, he was unable to mitigate the considerable \nsecurity concerns raised by his family in Iran. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated Foreign Preference concerns, but he has not mitigated \nForeign Influence security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs1.a-1.c: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.d-2.h: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

He failed to take any action to resolve most of the debts listed in\nthe Statement of Reasons (SOR), and his testimony and the evidence he presented give\nlittle reason to anticipate he will resolve those debts in the foreseeable future.\nOn March 11, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.1\nThe SOR alleges a security concern under Guideline F (financial considerations). Applicant\nsubmitted a response to the SOR, dated March 24, 2009, admitted all SOR allegations,\nand requested a hearing.\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nSeptember 24, 2009\n\n In the security clearance application he submitted in March 2008 (GE 1), Applicant listed continuous\n2\nemployment from October 1996 to October 2007. However, he testified he was actually unemployed for about\none year from some time in 1999 until sometime in 2000. (Tr. 47-52)   \n2\nThe case was assigned to me on May 29, 2009. A notice of hearing was issued on\nJuly 15, 2009, scheduling the hearing for August 17, 2009. The hearing was conducted as\nscheduled. The government submitted five documentary exhibits that were marked as\nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1-5 and admitted into the record without objection. Applicant\ntestified and submitted two documentary exhibits that were marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits\n(AE) 1 & 2 and admitted into the record without objection. The transcript was received on\nAugust 25, 2009.     \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In\naddition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 40-year-old man who has been employed as a security officer by a\ndefense contractor since March 2008. From June 2001 until October 2007, he worked as\na corrections officer in the state where he resides. He was fired from that position because\nhe failed to report misconduct committed by another corrections officer as was required of\nhim. Applicant previously worked as a corrections officer in another state from October\n1996, until either June 2001, or sometime in late 1999.2\nApplicant graduated from high school in June 1987. He was awarded a bachelor of\nscience degree in criminal justice in December 2006, and a master of public administration\ndegree through an online program in May 2009. \nApplicant served on active duty in the United States Army from November 1988 until\nAugust 1996. The highest rank he attained was sergeant (paygrade E-5). He was\ndischarged as a private (paygrade E-2). He testified the reduction in rank was solely due\nto him being absent without leave for a week and that he received an honorable discharge.\n(Tr. 90) \nApplicant was first married in July 1988. That marriage ended in divorce in January\n1997. He has been remarried since July 1999. Applicant has three children, ages 20, 13,\nand 5. His oldest daughter is attending college on a full scholarship and he provides her\nwith about $200 per month in financial assistance. The two younger children reside with\nApplicant and his wife.\nApplicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in August 1999. The bankruptcy\nwas dismissed in April 2001, because Applicant failed to comply with the plan that had\nbeen established to repay his creditors. The listed creditors in the bankruptcy included a\n1997 judgment based on a repossessed automobile, student loans, personal loans, a bank\noverdraft, and at least several credit card companies. Applicant never attempted to make\nrepayment arrangements with any of these creditors after the bankruptcy was dismissed.\n\n This amount includes $370.41 that is listed in Applicant\u2019s monthly statement from the IRS (AE 2)\n3\nunder the heading of \u201cLiabilities not shown.\u201d \n3\nApplicant owes delinquent federal income taxes for tax years 2002, 2003, and 2006.\nAs of August 5, 2009, the total amount he owed was $3,746.70.  Applicant contacted the\n3\nInternal Revenue Service shortly before the hearing of this case and entered into a\nrepayment agreement that requires him to make monthly payments of $200 commencing\non August 15, 2009. Applicant testified he placed the first payment in the mail on August\n11, 2009 (Tr. 97), but he did not submit any verification in support of that testimony.  \nThe judgment listed in Applicant\u2019s 1999 bankruptcy as owing in the amount of\n$7,071, and in the SOR as owing in the amount of $7,061, has now risen to approximately\n$11,500 through the accumulation of interest. (Tr. 62-63) The judgment is currently being\nsatisfied through a garnishment of Applicant\u2019s wages.\nThe SOR lists 11 delinquent accounts, totaling $7,957, that have been submitted\nfor collection. The dates of last activity on those accounts range from December 2001 to\nJanuary 2008. Most of the dates of last activity occurred between September 2005 and\nSeptember 2007. Applicant has not made any payment on any of these debts. He also has\nnot contacted any of these creditors in an effort to make repayment arrangements. The\nonly action he has taken to resolve his delinquent debts is to obtain a packet of bankruptcy\ndocuments from a document preparation service and fill them out in contemplation of filing\nfor Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection sometime in the near future. \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to his reported periods of unemployment,\nhis current low wages, and to his wife leaving her employment with the same company for\nwhich he now works. When he was interviewed on July 14, 2008, Applicant stated he and\nhis wife each earned $31,000 annually. (GE 3) He now earns $13.50 per hour working full-\ntime, and his wife earns $11 per hour working about 20-30 hours per week.  \nPolicies\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial decision based upon the relevant and\nmaterial facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in \u00b6\n6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular\ncondition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy\nguidance. Guideline F (financial considerations), with its disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions, is most relevant in this case. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at 2.\n4\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n5\n Department of the Navy v.

The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n4\n5\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,6\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n7\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n8\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n9\nclearance decision.10\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n11\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n12\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n13\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .\n(Adjudicative Guideline [AG] 18)\nApplicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in 1999. The repayment plan\nestablished for him under that bankruptcy was dismissed in 2001 due to his noncompliance\nwith the plan. He owes delinquent federal income taxes for tax years 2002, 2003, and\n2006. He has 11 delinquent collection accounts, totalling $7,957, that have been\n\n A review of Applicant\u2019s credit report (GE 4)  indicates it is possible that some accounts listed in the\n14\nSOR are duplicates of other accounts listed therein. However, it is impossible to make such a determination\nsolely through a review of the credit report with any degree of certainty. Applicant admitted each account in\nhis response to the SOR and thereafter failed to provide any evidence to meet his burden of establishing that\nany account is in fact a duplication of any other account.  \n5\ndelinquent for years.  Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness to\n14\nsatisfy debts; and DC 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations apply.\nApplicant listed continuous employment from October 1996 until October 2007 in\nthe security clearance application he submitted in March 2008, when he obtained his\ncurrent employment. He testified to the contrary that he was actually unemployed for about\none year between 1999 and 2000. He was fired from a job that he held from June 2001\nuntil October 2007, because he failed to abide by a condition of his employment as a\ncorrections officer that he report the misconduct of co-workers. He partly attributes his\nfinancial problems to these periods of unemployment. He also blames his financial\nproblems to low income due partly to his wife voluntarily leaving a job that was paying her\n$31,000 annually.\nThe record establishes that a judgment was entered against Applicant based on a\nrepossessed auto in 1997, long before he ever became unemployed. He owes delinquent\nfederal income taxes for three years during which he was employed as a corrections\nofficer. The date of last activity on most of his delinquent accounts occurred before he was\nfired from his job in October 2007. Accordingly, and regardless if he was unemployed from\n1999 until 2000 or not, his financial problems began before either period of unemployment,\ncontinued through his lengthy period of employment as a corrections officer, and have not\nbegun to be resolved. \n \nI conclude Mitigating Condition (MC) 20(a): the behavior . . . occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; MC 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; MC 20(c): . . . there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control; and MC 20(d): the\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\ndo not apply. \nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nThe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of his acts\nand omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration\nall relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and\nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant failed to mitigate the\n\n6\nfinancial considerations security concern. He has not overcome the case against him or\nsatisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. It is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact DOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owed delinquent debt totaling $15,856 to 16 creditors (SOR 1.a-1.p). Under Guideline E, personal conduct, Applicant was alleged to have deliberately falsified his March 14, 2008, e-QIP by not listing his arrest in January 2008 for assault and breach of peace 1 (SOR 2.a). In his Answer, Applicant admitted the debts excepting the wireless telephone debt in SOR 1.f, although he indicated that he had reduced the balance of the debt in SOR 1.e to $65 and he was paying $65 per month on the debt in SOR 1.k. Applicant denied that he deliberately omitted his assault arrest from his security clearance application. Applicant\u2019s admissions to various delinquencies are accepted and incorporated as findings of fact. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following additional factual findings. Applicant is 34 years old, and has been an employee of a defense contractor since early December 2007 (Ex. 1, A, Tr. 91). He seeks his first Department of Defense security clearance. Applicant started as a welder, but he has worked in the radiology field since February 2009 (Tr. 112).

The\n1\nSF 86 is part of the e-QIP (Ex. 1).\n2\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the\nDepartment of Defense as of September 1, 2006.\nOn July 13, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to me on August 6, 2009, to conduct a hearing and to determine\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant. On August 11, 2009, I scheduled a hearing for September 18,\n2009.\nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Six government exhibits (Ex. 1-6) and\neight Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-H) were admitted into evidence without objection.\nApplicant and his fiancee testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on\nSeptember 25, 2009.\nAt Applicant\u2019s request, I held the record open for additional documentation until\nOctober 2, 2009. On October 1, 2009, Applicant\u2019s fiancee submitted on Applicant\u2019s\nbehalf eight documents that were entered as exhibits I through P without objection.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owed\ndelinquent debt totaling $15,856 to 16 creditors (SOR 1.a-1.p). Under Guideline E,\npersonal conduct, Applicant was alleged to have deliberately falsified his March 14,\n2008, e-QIP  by not listing his arrest in January 2008 for assault and breach of peace\n1\n(SOR 2.a). In his Answer, Applicant admitted the debts excepting the wireless\ntelephone debt in SOR 1.f, although he indicated that he had reduced the balance of the\ndebt in SOR 1.e to $65 and he was paying $65 per month on the debt in SOR 1.k.\nApplicant denied that he deliberately omitted his assault arrest from his security\nclearance application. Applicant\u2019s admissions to various delinquencies are accepted\nand incorporated as findings of fact. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and\ntranscript, I make the following additional factual findings.\nApplicant is 34 years old, and has been an employee of a defense contractor\nsince early December 2007 (Ex. 1, A, Tr. 91). He seeks his first Department of Defense\nsecurity clearance. Applicant started as a welder, but he has worked in the radiology\nfield since February 2009 (Tr. 112).\nApplicant previously worked as an assistant teacher in state X, starting at an\nhourly wage of $6.50 or $7 in October 1995. From August 1997, when he switched\nemployers, he was paid between $8 and $9 hourly (Ex. 1, Tr. 107). Due to low wages\nand poor budgeting, Applicant had problems meeting his financial obligations. In about\n\nIt is unclear whether his daughter was born to Applicant and his first wife or from another relationship.\n2\nApplicant did not list his daughter on his e-QIP (Ex. 1).\nApplicant filed his income tax returns listing his spouse\u2019s address (Ex. D). He reported a different\n3\naddress for himself in state Y on his e-QIP (Ex. 1).\nApplicant testified that the $4,767 balance on his wireless phone account in SOR 1.d was on a family\n4\nplan where someone else ran up the bill. He is still waiting for this person to cover the cost (Tr. 56).\n3\n1996, he defaulted on a student loan that he had taken out for higher education (Tr. 70).\nIn about 1998 and 1999, he satisfied some consumer credit obligations with the\nassistance of a debt resolution firm. Applicant paid the company about $185 per month\nfor two years. He stopped making the payments because he felt that the company was\ntaking more of his money than the firm was paying to his creditors (Tr. 81-82). Applicant\ntook out a loan of $2,000 in 1999 (SOR 1.n) that he used to satisfy some credit card\nbalances (Tr. 77-78), but he then did not make his payments on the loan (Tr. 78).\nIn late September 2000, Applicant had a daughter (Tr. 90).  He married in\n2\nOctober 2000, but he and his first wife were divorced within months. Applicant incurred\nabout $563 in credit card charges (SOR 1.j) for clothing for his daughter. He and the\nmother of his child agreed that he would pay $325 in child support per month. Applicant\nhas been timely in his child support payments (Ex. 3, L, Tr. 90), but he made no\npayments on the credit card account after November 2001 (Ex. 1-5, Tr. 66-67).\nApplicant married his second wife in April 2001 (Ex. 1). Applicant became a\nstepfather to her daughter born in 1997 (Ex. D-G). Applicant and his spouse filed joint\nincome tax returns for tax year 2002, as a nonresident or part-time resident of state X\nwhere Applicant was employed. He and his spouse lived in adjacent state Y (Ex. 1, D).3\nTheir joint wages were $38,999, of which Applicant earned $14,125.64 (Ex. D). For tax\nyear 2003, Applicant and his spouse earned $48,822 with Applicant contributing  about\n$17,706 from his employment in state X (Ex. E).\nIn 2004, Applicant moved to state Z in the southeastern U.S. while his spouse\nremained in state Y. They filed joint income tax returns listing wages of $48,388, with\nApplicant having earned income in states X, Y, and Z of about $23,266 (Ex. F).\nApplicant and his spouse apparently lived apart in 2005, although they filed joint tax\nreturns. Their joint income increased slightly, to $49,563. Applicant earned $20,100\nfrom work with five different employers in state Z (Ex. G). Applicant filed as a single\ntaxpayer in 2006, listing adjusted gross income of $32,579 in state Z (Ex. H). In\nDecember 2007, Applicant and his second wife divorced (Ex. 1).\nApplicant fell behind on several financial obligations, while living in state Y and\nafter he moved to state Z. He incurred credit card charges (SOR 1.e, 1.p), including for\na computer (SOR 1.k), telephone costs (SOR 1.c, 1.d,  1.f, 1.g, 1.m), cable television\n4\nfees (SOR 1.h), and medical debts (SOR 1.b, 1.i) that became delinquent (Ex. 1-6). In\nSeptember 2006, an $875 lien was filed by state X\u2019s tax authority (Ex. 1-4), which\nApplicant indicated was related to his student loan debt that should have been paid\nthrough interception of his tax refunds (Tr. 75). However, it is noted that Applicant\n\n4\napparently did not file a state X return for tax year 2003, even though he earned\n$17,706 in the state that year (Ex. E). In July 2006, Applicant purchased a 2003 model-\nyear vehicle for $19,487. His account was referred for collection for nonpayment as of\nOctober 2006, and in about December 2007, he paid less than the full balance to settle\nthe debt (Ex. 4). He borrowed $9,000 from his father to settle the debt. He is repaying\nthe loan at $200 per month, and he turned over his $800 income tax refund for 2008 to\nhis father in  partial repayment of the loan (Tr. 88-89).\nIn July 2007, Applicant moved to his present geographic locale. From August to\nOctober 2007, he worked about three to four hours a day at $9.50 to $10 an hour in an\noffice. He was unemployed until December 3, 2007, when he started working for his\ncurrent employer at $13/25 an hour (Ex. A, Tr. 105-06). He was given an e-QIP to\ncomplete in December 2007 (Tr. 96-99, 101). He responded negatively to question 23.f\nconcerning any arrests within the last seven years. In response to the debt inquiries, he\nlisted 13 delinquent debts (SOR 1.a, 1.c-1.e, 1.g-1.n, 1.p) as they appeared on a report\nof his credit that he obtained (Ex. 1, Tr. 63).\nAfter he had submitted his initial response to question 23.f on the e-QIP,\nApplicant was arrested for domestic assault and disturbing the peace in early January\n2008. Applicant and his fiancee argued while driving from state Y back to his home, and\nthey stopped in a parking lot while continuing to argue. He put his arms around his\nfiancee, and an observer called the police. Applicant was arrested, and in court he\npleaded no contest on the advice of the district attorney (Ex. 2, Tr. 48).\nOn March 14, 2008, Applicant submitted his signed e-QIP (Ex. 1). He did not\ncorrect his negative response to question 23.f because he mistakenly recalled the\ninquiry as limited to felony arrests and he did not review the form carefully before he\nsigned it (Ex. 2, Tr. 37, 98, 103).\nIn March 2008, Applicant took out a personal loan of $950 with a bank that he is\nrepaying at $43.40 per month (Ex. 5, M). He used some of the funds to obtain a secure\ncredit card account in April 2008 with a $500 credit limit (Ex. 5, Tr. 86-87). On April 30,\n2008, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator about his finances. He\nexpressed his belief that he did not owe state X\u2019s tax authority, the medical debts, which\nshould have been covered by insurance, the computer debt in SOR 1.k or the wireless\nphone debt in SOR 1.f. He indicated that he had been paying on the credit card debt in\nSOR 1.e, so the balance had been reduced from $577 to $386. Applicant did not\ndispute the other debt balances, and he expressed his intent to resolve them. He\nplanned to satisfy the smaller debts (SOR 1.h and 1.p) by December 2008 and the rest\nof his debts by December 2013. Applicant volunteered that he had been arrested in\nJanuary 2008 for domestic assault and disturbing the peace, but the state did not\nprosecute him in return for good behavior for 18 months. He explained that he had not\nlisted the charges on his e-QIP because he thought only felonies needed to be reported\n(Ex. 2).\nIn June 2008, Applicant opened a credit card with a $300 limit that had a balance\nof $331 as of July 2008 (Ex. 5). By February 2009, the lender had closed the account\n\nAfter the hearing, Applicant submitted his three latest pay stubs showing weekly deductions of $80\n5\nand $75 along with annotations identifying the $80 as child support and the $75 going to the bank from which\nhe and his fiancee pay their joint household expenses (Ex. L, M, Tr. 119).\n5\nbecause he was two months behind ($31) in his payments (Ex. 6), although he\nsubsequently caught up in his payments as of August 2009 (Ex. K). As of mid-June\n2008, Applicant had a negative balance of $60.10 in his checking account due in part to\nhis habit of eating in fast food establishments and stopping for coffee. He reduced\nthose expenses at the urging of his fiancee, and had a net positive balance of $337.21\nthe following month (Ex. N). \nDOHA subsequently sent financial interrogatories to Applicant requesting\ndocumentation of any payments on his delinquent debts. Applicant responded on\nDecember 9, 2008, that his monthly income of $1,516 was sufficient only to cover his\ndaily living expenses, including his child support and $245 in loan repayments to his\nfather and the bank. Applicant expressed his intent to repay the debt when his finances\npermitted, hopefully within the next five years (Ex. 3).\nIn mid-June 2009, Applicant stipulated to a judgment in court, agreeing to repay\n$65 per month starting in mid-July (Ex. C) for the computer he purchased for $2,398 in\nabout February 2002 (SOR 1.k). Due to interest, the debt had risen to more than $3,044\n(Ex. 5). He paid $65 on July 16, 2009, August 3, 2009, and August 31, 2009 (Ex. O). On\nJuly 31, 2009, Applicant settled the credit card debt in SOR 1.j, paying about $280 of\nthe approximate $694 balance (Ex. 3, 5, J, Tr. 67-68). He testified that in about August\n2009, he settled the debt in SOR 1.e for about $300, using a credit card to do so (Tr.\n58). As of September 2009, he disputed his liability for the medical debts in SOR 1.b\nand 1.i on the basis that they should have been covered by insurance (Tr. 31), and for\nthe wireless telephone debt in SOR 1.f because the company is his current carrier and\npresumably would not have taken him on as a customer if he had an unpaid balance\n(Tr. 61-62). Applicant did not dispute the debts with the credit bureaus because he was\nunaware of the process (Tr. 62).  He also questioned the validity of the tax judgment in\nSOR 1.l. (Tr. 75). Applicant responded to collection efforts by the creditors in SOR 1.e,\n1.j, and 1.k. He has not contacted those creditors holding undisputed debts who have\nyet to pursue collection (SOR 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.g, 1.m, 1.n, 1.p and 1.o (duplicate of 1.a))\n(Tr. 56, 64, 76-78, 80, 113) because he has been trying to get his life on track (Tr. 54).\nHe learned from the cable company that his debt had been sent for collection so he\nwould have to wait for the assignee to contact him, so that debt also was unpaid (Tr. 64-\n65). Applicant intends to satisfy his outstanding delinquencies within the next three\nyears (Tr. 54-55).\nApplicant\u2019s work performance has been fully satisfactory since he started with the\ndefense contractor. In early September 2009, he passed a certification examination in\nhandling radioactive materials (Ex. P). He received pay raises over time from his initial\n$13.25 hourly base rate to his present $17.07 per hour, supplemented by a shift\ndifferential and overtime pay when available (Ex. A). During the weeks of August 9,\n2009, through September 19, 2009, his weekly take-home pay ranged from $369.87 to\n$472.69 (Ex. L).  He had been residing with his fiancee for the past year (Tr. 109), and\n5\n\n6\nwas contributing $535 per month toward their rent (Ex. O). His fiancee earns about $17\nan hour from her work as a research coordinator (Tr. 109-10). She handles paying the\nhousehold expenses (Tr. 81, 119), and has been working with him to reduce his\nexpenses, especially eating out, and to live within a budget (Tr. 81, 120-22). His\nfinancial situation has improved of late to where he was able to save $100 last month\n(Tr. 114, 136). His fiancee has accumulated $8,000 in savings in an account in her\nname, about $2,000 of which represents contributions from Applicant (Tr. 130-31). She\nhas not given him access to the funds because she wants Applicant to learn to live\nbelow his means and not count on overtime pay to meet expenses (Tr. 129, 132).  In\nAugust 2009, he bought his fiancee a $500 laptop computer for her birthday, putting\n$100 on credit and paying cash for the rest. He had saved the funds from working\novertime on Sundays since May or June 2009 (Tr. 137-42). As of September 2009,\nApplicant was eating out once a week whereas he had been doing so daily about a year\nago (Tr. 140-41, 143).\n \nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive\nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,\nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy\nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a\nsecurity clearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines\n(AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are\nrequired to be considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the\ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\n\n7\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern about finances is set out in AG \u00b6 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nApplicant has had problems meeting his financial obligations for the past decade.\nHe retained the services of a debt resolution firm over the 1998/99 time frame but he\nstopped making his payments over concerns about allocation of his monies paid to the\ndebt repayment plan. He satisfied some credit card debt through a $2,000 loan and then\ndid not repay the loan. During his second marriage, he was timely in his child support\npayments. Yet, he incurred new debt, including $3,903 in wireless telephone charges on\na family plan (SOR 1.d). After he moved to state Z in 2004, he had rent (SOR 1.a and\n1.o, duplicate), cable television (SOR 1.h), and telephone charges (SOR 1.g, 1.m) that\nhe failed to pay. When he submitted his e-QIP in March 2008, his credit record showed\noutstanding delinquent balances totaling about $13,978. AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not\nmeeting financial obligations, and \u201d AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts,\u201d clearly apply.\nAs of September 2009, Applicant had not resolved most of the debts in the SOR.\nOnly those delinquencies in SOR 1.j and apparently SOR 1.e had been satisfied, albeit\nfor less than their full balances,  and with respect to SOR 1.e, by relying on credit that\nwill have to be repaid. AG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d\ncannot reasonably apply where there are ongoing financial issues.\n\n8\nThere is credible evidence that would implicate low wages as a negative\ninfluence on Applicant\u2019s financial situation, certainly before 2002 and perhaps during his\nmarriage. See AG \u00b6 20(b) (stating, \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem\nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d). Joint income tax returns filed\nwith his second wife for tax years 2002 through 2005 show that he earned $14,125.64,\n$17,706, $23,366, and $20,100 over those four years. Their joint income, which was\nmore than $48,000 in each of the tax years 2003, 2004, and 2005, would seem to have\nbeen enough to make some payments on his debts, but it is also not clear whether\nApplicant\u2019s spouse helped him financially. Applicant also had separate living expenses\nafter he moved to state Z in 2004, if not before then, and the ongoing child support\nobligation for his daughter. After he moved to his present locale in 2007, he worked only\npart-time and was unemployed from October 2007 until early December 2007. AG \u00b6\n20(b) applies in part, but it does not extenuate the financial judgment concerns raised\nby his spending habits. He ate out on a daily basis without regard to whether he could\nafford to do so, as evidenced by a negative balance on his bank account as of June\n2008. In August 2009, he bought a laptop computer for his fiancee, spending $400 of\nhis savings when most of his creditors had not been paid.\nApplicant has received no formal counseling since he was involved in the debt\nrepayment plan in 1998/99, although his fiancee has given him good advice about\nreducing his spending and not relying on overtime earnings to cover incurred costs. His\nbank records submitted after the hearing confirm a significant reduction in the frequency\nof his spending on fast food meals from June to July 2008. Yet, while he no longer\noverdraws his bank account, recent reliance on loans and credit cards for debt\npayments tend to indicate that his problems are not yet resolved. He borrowed $9,000\nfrom his father that he used to settle his delinquent car loan in December 2007. In\nMarch 2008, he took out a $950 loan from a bank, in part to acquire a secure credit\ncard. In August 2009, he settled the debt in SOR 1.e by transferring balances from one\nlender to another. A credit card account opened in June 2008 was closed after he fell\nbehind in his payments. Under these circumstances, it would be premature to apply AG\n20(c), \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d\nIn addition to settling the debts in SOR 1.e in August 2009, and SOR 1.j in late\nJuly 2009, Applicant has been repaying a judgment for the computer debt in SOR 1.k\nsince July 2009. However, these efforts to resolve his debts, post issuance of the SOR,\nand in response to collection efforts, are not sufficient to apply AG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to\nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the\nissue,\u201d could apply to the tax lien as it does not appear on his recent credit reports.\nHowever, the wireless phone debt in SOR 1.f and the medical debts were being\n\n9\nreported as outstanding collection balances. Absent any evidence of insurance\ncoverage applicable to the medical debts, or of documentation disproving his liability for\nthe wireless phone debt in SOR 1.f or the tax lien, AG \u00b6 20(e) is not satisfied. Despite\nthe favorable changes in his spending habits, Applicant has not fully mitigated the\nfinancial concerns.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern about personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nApplicant does not dispute that he failed to disclose his January 2008 assault\narrest on his March 2008 e-QIP, but he denies that he intended to conceal the\ninformation. He testified credibly that he was initially asked to complete the form in\nDecember 2007, around the time of his hiring by the defense contractor. He read the\npolice inquiries as limited to felony offenses when he initially reviewed the form. In\nresponse to the financial record inquiries, he made a concerted effort over the next few\nmonths to obtain his credit record and to list his delinquencies on the e-QIP. By the time\nhe signed and submitted his e-QIP in March 2008, the state had agreed not to\nprosecute him on the criminal charges. The evidence does not substantiate that he had\nthe intent to deceive or conceal that is required under AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d\nConcerns about his lack of candor are unsubstantiated (see AG \u00b6 17(f), \u201cthe\ninformation was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability\u201d) because of\nhis disclosures of his financial problems on the e-QIP and his candor during his April 30,\n2008, interview with a government investigator. As reflected in the investigator\u2019s report\nof the interview (Ex. 2), Applicant volunteered the fact of his assault arrest in January\n2008, which is inconsistent with an intent to conceal. AG \u00b6 17(a), \u201cthe individual made\nprompt, good faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before\nbeing confronted with the facts,\u201d is established. \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the conduct\nand all the relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed\nat AG \u00b6 2(a):\n\n10\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant\u2019s inability to remain current in his financial obligations was due in part\nto limited income, but also to poor financial management. He had a habit of  spending\non restaurant meals daily, without regard to whether he had the funds to cover the\ncosts. A family member or friend incurred excessive wireless phone charges on the\nfamily account Applicant had opened in or before March 2006, but Applicant\u2019s ongoing\ndisregard of this and other delinquencies continues to cast doubts about his financial\njudgment. Largely because of his fiancee\u2019s advice and help, he has begun changing his\nfinancial behavior to ensure no new delinquencies. But I cannot conclude that his\nfinancial problems are safely in the past, given he has resolved only a few of his\ndelinquent debts and he was behind as of February 2009 on a credit card account that\nhe had held only since June 2008. If Applicant can establish a payment plan on his\nSOR debts for six months, and no other security concerns arise, he will be a good\ncandidate for a security clearance when again eligible 12 months after the date of this\ndecision.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n11\nParagraph 2, Guideline E: FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

He is a specialist in information technology and is employed as a senior systems administrator (Tr. 7, 24). He has been employed by his current employer since October 2007, and moved from a temporary employee to a permanent employee in April 2008 (Tr. 24). He graduated from high school in 1986, and subsequently attended about a year of college in the 1990s (Tr. 7, 22). He served in the Air Force from 1988 to 1996 (Tr. 23). He was married from 1987 to 2002, and remarried in December 2002 (Tr. 23). He has five children (three are stepchildren) ages 20, 13, 12, 6 and 6 (Tr. 23). He does not pay any child support.

He has \ndemonstrated a meaningful track record of debt repayment. He paid six of nine \nstatement of reason (SOR) debts. One SOR debt is in a current payment plan. One \ndebt is in litigation, and one debt has not yet been adequately addressed. Other debts \nwere paid or are in current payment plans. He credibly promised to pay his debts. \nAccess to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn April 29, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) (SF 86) (Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On February \n11, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR detailing \nthe basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation, citing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nJune 10, 2009\n\n \n \n2 \n \n                                           \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The SOR detailed \nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the \nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his \nsecurity clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \nwhether his clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn February 28, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on April \n14, 2009. The case was assigned to me on April 16, 2009. On April 17, 2009, DOHA \nissued a hearing notice. The hearing was held on May 20, 2009. At the hearing, \nDepartment Counsel offered four exhibits (GE 1-4) (Transcript (Tr.) 16), and Applicant \noffered 12 exhibits (AE A-L) (Tr. 18-21). There were no objections, and I admitted GEs \n1-4 (Tr. 17), and AE A-L (Tr. 21). Additionally, I admitted the SOR, response to the SOR \nand the hearing notice (GEs 5-7). On May 26, 2009, Applicant provided 12 additional \nexhibits (AE M-X). Department counsel did not object to my consideration of AE M-X \nand I admitted these exhibits. I received the transcript on May 28, 2009. I closed the \nrecord on June 1, 2009 (Tr. 86).     \n   \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nIn his SOR response, Applicant admitted responsibility for the SOR debts in \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a, 1.d, and 1.g (GE 7). He essentially denied responsibility for the other debts with \nexplanations (GE 7).    \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor (Tr. 6-7). He is a \nspecialist in information technology and is employed as a senior systems administrator \n(Tr. 7, 24). He has been employed by his current employer since October 2007, and \nmoved from a temporary employee to a permanent employee in April 2008 (Tr. 24). He \ngraduated from high school in 1986, and subsequently attended about a year of college \nin the 1990s (Tr. 7, 22). He served in the Air Force from 1988 to 1996 (Tr. 23). He was \nmarried from 1987 to 2002, and remarried in December 2002 (Tr. 23). He has five \nchildren (three are stepchildren) ages 20, 13, 12, 6 and 6 (Tr. 23).  He does not pay any \nchild support. \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant began working at a large communications corporation in 1997 (Tr. 45). \nBy 2004, Applicant was receiving over $100,000 per year from this employer (Tr. 25). \nHe was laid off in March 2005 (Tr. 25, 45). He received several months of severance \npay and thereafter he received unemployment pay of $1,552 per month until his \nunemployment benefits expired (Tr. 46, 48). Prior to being laid off, he had excellent \ncredit and was able to buy a house without providing a down payment (Tr. 26). During \n \n1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n\n \n \n3 \n \nhis unemployment, he used his 401K and savings to pay living expenses (Tr. 25). Using \nsavings and gifts from his parents, he was able to make payments on many of his debts \nfor 18 months (Tr. 40, 53). He tried to sell real estate and over a six or seven month \nperiod earned about $6,000 (Tr. 47). He had a part-time job from January 2006 to July \n2007, which paid about $1,700 per month (Tr. 48). He was unemployed again from \nAugust to October 2007 (Tr. 51).  When he started with his current employer, he was \nmaking $24 an hour, and he is now making $31 per hour (Tr. 51). The reason his debts \nbecame delinquent was because of unemployment and underemployment (Tr. 52, 68, \n71).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR listed nine debts. He paid the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, \n1.h and 1.i. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g is in a current payment plan. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e \nis in litigation, and the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a has not yet been adequately addressed. The \nsource, status, and amount of his individual SOR debts are more specifically described \nas follows (paragraph letters correspond with the SOR subparagraphs): \n  \n(a) Credit card debt of $10,044 resulted in a judgment filed in October 2007 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a; Tr. 25-27). After the judgment, he made six payments for $25 a month, and \nthen the creditor changed their name to a new name (Tr. 26-29). On June 11, 2008, he \nowed $10,363 (AE P). He declined to make payments to the new collection company \nbecause he was seeking verification that the new collection company owned the debt \n(Tr. 26-28). On September 21, 2008, he wrote the creditor seeking verification; \nhowever, the only response was a demand for payments (Tr. 27-28). His letter included \nsome valid questions, such as asking for proof of the amount of the debt (including \ncharges and previous payments); however, it also included some terms that a \nresponsible creditor should not have to provide as a prerequisite to receiving payment, \nsuch as demanding proof that the statute of limitations had not expired (AE N); \n \n(b) Electrical account of $281 was paid on April 24, 2009 (SOR \u00b6 1.b; Tr. 29-30; \nAE F). He believed it was previously paid, but could not locate a receipt (Tr. 30); \n \n(c) Medical debt of $140 was paid on May 12, 2009 (SOR \u00b6 1.c; Tr. 30-32; AE Q \nat 3). The debt was generated in 2006, and was not paid sooner because it was billed to \nhis stepson\u2019s father (Tr. 30-31). He was unaware of the debt until he received the credit \nreport in connection with processing his security clearance (Tr. 31);   \n \n(d) Credit card debt of $1,693 (SOR \u00b6 1.d; Tr. 33). He stopped making payments \non this account in mid-2006 (Tr. 34). He made two, $40 payments in January and \nFebruary 2009, in an attempt to get a payment plan started (Tr. 35-36). On March 14, \n2009, the balance was $1,735 (AE J). On April 24, 2009, he paid $750, and on May 1, \n2009, the balance was $1,018 (AE I, L). On May 15, 2009, Applicant paid $397 towards \nthis debt (AE K). On May 22, 2009, the creditor indicated the debt was paid (AE U). \n \n(e) Credit card debt of $7,678 (SOR \u00b6 1.e; Tr. 36-38). This debt is in litigation \nbecause creditor added excessive charges to the bill and allegedly engaged in abusive \ncollection practices (Tr. 36; AE V). The lawsuit was filed on April 20, 2009 (AE V). \n\n \n \n4 \n \nApplicant admitted he owed a debt to the creditor and believed the debt should be for \nabout $3,000 (Tr. 38).    \n \n(f) Store credit debt of $538 (SOR \u00b6 1.f; Tr. 38-39). He said he paid this debt \npreviously, and decided to pay it again to get if off of his credit report (Tr. 39). On May \n13, 2009, this debt was settled for $250 and paid (AE C; Tr. 39). \n \n(g) Credit union credit card debt of $13,505 (SOR \u00b6 1.g). Applicant said he paid \n$500 initially, and was supposed to pay $234 monthly on the 15th of the month (Tr. 41). \nOn May 6, 2009, this debt was \u201cpaid\u201d using a re-write of the account (Tr. 42; AE G, Q at \n2). This procedure eliminated the old delinquent debt; however, a new debt was \ngenerated (Tr. 42);  \n \n(h) Medical debt of $100 (SOR \u00b6 1.h; Tr. 32-33, 42-43). On May 2, 2009, this \ndebt was paid (amount shown is $106.95) (AE Q at 2; Tr. 43). \n \n(i) Energy debt of $88 (SOR \u00b6 1.i; Tr. 44). On October 11, 2006, this debt was \npaid (Tr. 44). See letter from creditor, dated May 6, 2009 (AE H). \n \nOn March 10, 2009, a non-SOR creditor offered to settle a debt for $1,009 for a \n30% discount (AE D). The payment schedule for resolution was three payments of \n$235.54 (AE D). Applicant made the first two payments (AE D; AE Q at 4). \n \nApplicant provided a bill from a credit union, dated April 24, 2009, indicating he \nowed $211 (AE E) on a non-SOR debt of $11,251 (Tr. 64-65; AE O). Applicant wanted \nto make monthly payments for about $60 to keep the account current; however, the \ncreditor wanted more money (Tr. 64-65). Applicant signed a settlement agreement and \npromised to pay $155 monthly until the debt was paid (AE S).  His first payment is due \nJune 20, 2009 (AE V).  \n \nApplicant paid several non-SOR debts (Tr. 60-63; GE 2; AE A, X). Applicant \npurchased a model-2008 car in April 2008, and financed $14,454 with monthly \npayments of $240 (Tr. 63; GE 3 at 3). His car payment is current (GE 3 at 3).  \n \nApplicant and his spouse\u2019s current monthly net pay is about $6,000 (Tr. 54, 69). \nIn December 2008, his wife obtained employment (earning about $2,000 per month), as \nan asset recovery specialist at a bank (collects on car loans) (Tr. 69). Prior to obtaining \nthis employment she was essentially unemployed (Tr. 70). \n \nApplicant and his spouse purchased their home in 2004 and their mortgage is \n$136,000 and their monthly mortgage payment is $1,460 (Tr. 55; GE 3 at 3). Other \nmonthly expenses are: clothing-$100; food-$650; phone, cable and internet-$175; \nutilities-$185; vehicle fuel and insurance-$335; medical-$120; entertainment-$100 (Tr. \n56-59). In June 2008, they recently purchased a central air conditioning and heating \nsystem for their residence, which cost $22,800 and has a monthly payment of $225 (Tr. \n\n \n \n5 \n \n58, 61-62). Applicant estimated they have about $1,000 monthly left after paying their \nexpenses (Tr. 59).  \n \nApplicant debt repayment plan is based on Dave Ramsey\u2019s advice. Essentially, \nhis plan is to pay off one debt at a time, and then to use the extra funds saved from \nmaking payments to pay off the next debt. This plan is known as the Dave Ramsey \ndebt-snowball plan (Tr. 60).  \n \nThree character witnesses described Applicant as courageous, honest, loyal, \nprudent, frugal, hard working, capable and/or responsible (Tr. 71, 73-75, 78-81). \nApplicant loves his country, and his family and is loyal to them (Tr. 73-75). Applicant \naggressively sought additional income through part-time employment and applying for \nemployment in the years 2005 to 2007 (Tr. 78-81).  \n   \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \n\n \n \n6 \n \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcern is under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the \nsecurity concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and, \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) provides, \u201cApplicant\u2019s credit \nreport was sufficient to establish the Government\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant had  \n[ ] delinquent [SOR] debts that are of security concern.\u201d Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent \ndebt is documented in his SF 86, his responses to DOHA interrogatories, his SOR \nresponse and at his hearing. He failed to ensure his creditors were paid as agreed. The \n\n \n \n7 \n \ngovernment established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). Further \ninquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is required. \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) or 20(e) \nbecause he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent \ndebts. His delinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal \nBoard\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)).  \n \nApplicant receives full credit under AG \u00b6 20(b) because his financial problems \ninitially resulted because of unemployment and underemployment. He receives \nsubstantial mitigating credit because his delinquent debt \u201coccurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on [his] current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d He established that he paid six SOR \ndebts and several non-SOR debts. He is making payments under a payment plan for \none debt, one debt is in litigation, and one debt needs further resolution. He has a plan \nto keep his debts current, including several substantial non-SOR debts. He has ample \nincome to pay his debts.   \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) applies. Applicant received some financial counseling via the Dave \nRamsey plan, and there are \u201cclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \n\n \n \n8 \n \n                                           \nunder control\u201d for the reasons stated in the preceding paragraph. He understands the \nsecurity implications of delinquent debt and will scrupulously avoid future delinquent \ndebt. He has also established some, but not full mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) because \nhe showed substantial good faith2 in the resolution of his SOR debts.    \n \nApplicant contests the validity of the amount of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e and wants \nbetter documentation of the amount of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a before he starts making \npayments. He provided his court filing contesting the amount owed on the debt in SOR \n\u00b6 1.e, and the letter seeking more information about the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He credibly \npromised to pay these two debts once he establishes their validity.3 His conduct shows \nhe acted responsibly under the circumstances.4 AG \u00b6 20(e) does not fully apply \nbecause he did not provide sufficient corroborating documentation about his efforts to \nestablish his responsibility for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a.   \n \nIn sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts \nsooner to resolve his delinquent debts. Nevertheless, he established the full applicability \nof AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(c). Moreover, security concerns are fully mitigated under the \n\u201cWhole Person Concept,\u201d infra at pages 8-10.  \n \n \n2The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n3 Of course, the government can re-validate Applicant\u2019s financial status at any time through credit \nreports, investigation and/or additional interrogatories. Approval of a clearance now does not bar the \ngovernment from subsequently revoking it, if warranted. Violation of a promise made in a security context \nto pay legitimate debts also raises judgment concerns under Guideline E, and may support future \nrevocation of a security clearance.  This does not imply that this clearance is conditional. \n \n4\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \n\n \n \n9 \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n  \nThere is evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial conduct. Several of \nApplicant\u2019s debts became delinquent in 2004-2006. In October 2007, he began his \npresent employment. In December 2008, his wife began her current employment.  \nHowever, he should have made greater progress on his debts beginning in December \n2008. He received the SOR in February 2009, and he should have aggressively sought \ndebt resolution of his SOR debts, including utilization of debt repayment, and payment \nplans. He should have ensured better documentation of his remedial efforts. These \nfactors show some financial irresponsibility and lack of judgment. His history of \ndelinquent debt raises sufficient security concerns to merit further inquiry.   \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is more substantial. \nThere is no evidence of any security violation. He is a law-abiding citizen. His current \nfinancial problems were caused by his unemployment, and underemployment. He paid \nsix of nine SOR debts. He is making payments on one substantial SOR debt for about \n$10,000; and on an $11,000 non-SOR debt. A SOR debt for $3,000 to $7,000 is in \nlitigation. He is investigating the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a for about $10,000. He is making his \npayments on his mortgage, his car, and on a central air conditioning and heating unit \n(owes about $22,000). He listed several non-SOR debts that he has recently paid (AE \nA). He and his spouse have had ample income to pay their debts since they both \nbecame employed in December 2008. The Appeal Board has addressed a key element \nin the whole person analysis in financial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of \n\n \n \n10 \n \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation \nand his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for \nthe reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6  E2.2(a) (\u2018Available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.\u2019) There is no requirement that a plan provide for \npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable \nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such \ndebts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts \nactually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in \nthe SOR. \n \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted).  \n \nAlthough Applicant is only 41 years old, he has achieved some important \neducational and employment goals, demonstrating his self-discipline, responsibility and \ndedication. He served on active duty for eight years in the Air Force. He is an expert in \nnetworks and information technology. His financial problems were caused by his \nunemployment and underemployment from March 2005 to October 2007, rather than by \nhis misconduct or irresponsible spending. Before his employment problems in March \n2005, he did not have any delinquent debts. Applicant is clearly an intelligent person \nand he understands how to budget and what he needs to do to establish his financial \nresponsibility. His wife works in a bank, and is involved in vehicle repossessions. He \nuses the Dave Ramsey plan, and pays off a debt, and then moves to the next debt. \nClearly, he could have acted more aggressively to resolve his debts, after receiving \nemployment with a government contractor. There is, however, simply no reason not to \ntrust him. Moreover, he has established a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt re-payment. \nHe has promised to pay his valid debts. I found his statement to be candid, forthright \nand credible. Applicant has demonstrated his loyalty, patriotism and trustworthiness \nthrough his service to the Department of Defense as a contractor and to the U.S. Air \nForce. These factors, especially his past government service, show sufficient \nresponsibility and rehabilitation to mitigate security concerns.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the \nfinancial considerations security concerns.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \n\n \n \n11 \n \nhas mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nhe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.i:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nMark W. Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant repaid some of his delinquent debt, but did not demonstrate his ability\nto repay more than $90,000 in remaining delinquent debt. He provided insufficient\nevidence to mitigate resulting security concerns. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on February 12, 2008. On February 4, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F.  The action was taken under Executive Order\n1\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \nJune 19, 2009\n\nItem 3.\n2\nThe Government submitted six items in support of the allegations.\n3\nItem 4.\n4\nItem 3.\n5\nAnswer to FORM at 1-2; Item 5 at 4.\n6\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 18, 2009, and requested that\nhis case be decided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing.2\nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on April 8, 2009. A\ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)  was provided to Applicant, and\n3\nhe was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation,\nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM. \nApplicant signed the document acknowledging receipt of his copy of the FORM\non April 14, 2009, and returned it to DOHA. He timely submitted additional material\nconcerning repayments toward his debts, and made no objection to consideration of any\nevidence submitted by Department Counsel, in a letter dated May 11, 2009, that was\nreceived by DOHA on May 13, 2009. On May 15, 2009, Department Counsel indicated\nthat he did not object to the admissibility into evidence of anything submitted by\nApplicant. I received the case assignment on May 28, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is married, with\nno children. He has been employed in his present capacity since January 2008. He has\nno prior military service.  In his response to the SOR, he admitted the truth of all\n4\nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h, without further explanation.

He continued to seek IT\nemployment until 2005, when he was finally offered a temporary position at $30,000 per\nyear. He decided to accept this position despite the 50% reduction in salary that was\ninvolved, because his manufacturing job lacked any upward mobility.

His mortgage loan was never\ndelinquent, but he was unable to repay many unsecured debts on time. He did make\nsome partial payments toward some of them, but continues to owe substantially more\nthan he can afford to repay. Particulars concerning the SOR-listed debts are as follows:\nSOR \u00b6 1.a involves a credit card account that was charged off by the original\ncreditor in April 2006, in the amount of $38,461, and transferred to another creditor. The\ndebt grew to $39,680 by December 5, 2008, despite Applicant\u2019s periodic payments of\n$100 to $200 toward the debt between November 2006 and May 2009. After his latest\npayment, the amount due is $35,111, and he is being charged 23.99% interest.  \n7\nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.f involve the same credit card debt as\nreported on two different credit bureau reports (CBRs). As of December 5, 2008, this\ndebt was $16,946. It was charged off and placed for collection by the original creditor\nafter it became delinquent in August 2005. Applicant made three $100 payments to the\ncollection agency toward this account in January, February, and April 2009.8\nSOR \u00b6 1.c describes a consumer loan account that was placed for collection after\nit became delinquent in September 2005. The balance due as of December 5, 2008,\nwas $14,176. Applicant offered no evidence of any payments toward this debt.9\nApplicant had two delinquent student loans as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and e.\nThese loans, incurred in connection with Applicant\u2019s second bachelor\u2019s degree, were\ncombined for an original total loan amount of $12,597. On December 5, 2008, both\nloans were reported 150 days past due in the total amount of $9,028, as alleged and\nadmitted. Since January 2009, Applicant has made four payments toward this debt,\ntotaling $1,650. These payments have brought the loan into a current status, with $145\nmonthly payments due going forward toward the remaining $7,608 balance.  \n10\nApplicant owed $16,390 on another charged-off credit card debt as alleged in\nSOR \u00b6 1.g. This debt also became delinquent in August 2005, and was charged off in\nJune 2006. Applicant documented no payments toward this debt, but in January 2009,\nhe retained an attorney for $950 to negotiate a repayment agreement for him. He\nreported no progress toward resolution, however.   \n11\n\nItem 5 at 5; Answer to FORM at 5 and Entry H. \n12\n4\nFinally, Applicant defaulted on another educational loan from a bank in the\namount of $7,948. His last payment toward this loan was in March 2006, and it was\ncharged off by the creditor in October 2006. Applicant submitted an IRS Form 1099-C\nfrom a bank with a different name showing cancellation of $7,624 in debt on October 2,\n2008, implying that this reflected cancellation of this obligation. However, the account\nnumber does not match the one shown on the CBR, and neither the creditor\u2019s name nor\nthe debt amount match either. Accordingly, it does not establish extinguishment of this\ndebt.12\nIn sum, the evidence establishes that Applicant still has five outstanding\ndelinquent debts totaling at least $90,271, not including the formerly delinquent student\nloan debt of which $7,608 remains outstanding. He provided no information concerning\nhis current monthly income or expenses from which to determine whether he will\ncontinue to spend more than he earns or have any legal means by which he could\nreduce his outstanding debt. He showed no evidence of financial counseling or other\nefforts to learn better financial management, and offered no other evidence concerning\nhis character, trustworthiness or responsibility. I was unable to evaluate his credibility,\ndemeanor or character in person since he elected to have his case decided without a\nhearing. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n5\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides: \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to an\napplicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense\nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set\nout in AG \u00b6 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not\nmeeting financial obligations,\u201d are potentially disqualifying. Department Counsel cited\nboth of these conditions in his argument, and both are supported on this record.\nApplicant documented a few payments toward some of his delinquencies. However, he\ndid not demonstrate the ability to pay these debts going forward, and has a lengthy\nhistory of not meeting his financial obligations. More than $90,000 in delinquent debt\nremains outstanding as of date the record closed. The evidence supporting these\ndisqualifying conditions requires a closer examination and balancing of resulting security\nconcerns with any potentially mitigating matters, and shifts the burden to Applicant to\nrebut, explain, extenuate or mitigate those concerns.\n\n6\nThe guideline includes several conditions that could mitigate security concerns\narising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), disqualifying conditions may be\nmitigated where \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s financial\nirresponsibility is both long-standing and continues to date. He remains substantially in\ndebt and his current financial situation precludes a finding that delinquent indebtedness\nis unlikely to recur. The evidence does not support application of this potentially\nmitigating condition. \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(b), it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Applicant did not\ndemonstrate that any of his delinquent debt arose from circumstances that were beyond\nhis control, that the debts were unavoidable, or caused by anything other than spending\nmore than he earned. Applicant has not established mitigation of any of his debts under\nthis provision.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under AG \u00b6 20(c). Similarly, AG \u00b6 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\u201d There is no evidence of financial counseling, but some\nmitigation under these provisions was established by his recent and commendable\nefforts to resolve some of his delinquencies and bring his student loans into current\nstatus. However, the record is devoid of evidence supporting his ability to follow through\non repayment of more than $90,000 in outstanding debts, and insufficient responsible\nperformance has occurred to date to alleviate the substantial security concerns raised\nby the length and degree of financial irresponsibility that continues in large part to date. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n7\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature individual who\nis responsible for his choices and conduct. He presently has at least $90,000 in  debt,\nand did not meet his burden to prove an ongoing ability to repay it. None of his debt was\nshown to have arisen for reasons beyond his control. His actions in repaying some\ndebts were commendable, but insufficient on balance to support a finding that such\nfinancial irresponsibility will not recur. His debts continue to create substantial potential\nfor pressure, coercion, or duress. The record contains insufficient other evidence about\nhis character or responsibility to mitigate these concerns, or tending to make their\ncontinuation less likely. Overall, the record evidence creates substantial doubt as to\nApplicant\u2019s present eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these\nreasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his\nhistory of not meeting his financial obligations and inability to satisfy his current debts. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nSeptember 17, 2010\n______________\nDECISION\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on March 5, 2007. (Government Exhibit 1.) On June 10, 2009, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on June 25, 2009, and requested a\nhearing before an administrative judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\non October 25, 2009. I received the case assignment on November 5, 2009.  DOHA\nissued notices of hearing on November 6 and November 24, 2009. I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on December 3, 2009. The Government offered Government\n\n2\nExhibits 1 through 4, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his\nown behalf, called two additional witnesses, and submitted Applicant Exhibits A through\nE, which were also admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the\nhearing on December 10, 2009. The record closed on December 3, 2009. Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is 46 and married.  He is employed by a defense contractor and seeks\nto retain a security clearance in connection with his employment. Applicant admitted all\nof the allegations in the SOR. Those admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement)\nThe Government alleges under Guideline H that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has used illegal drugs.\nApplicant has been employed in the defense industry since 1981. (Government\nExhibit 3, Section 11.) He first began using marijuana in 1979. He used it until\napproximately 1990. While marijuana was his drug of choice, he also used hashish,\nmushrooms, cocaine and crystal methamphetamine during the period 1979 through\n1988. He used marijuana, cocaine and crystal methamphetamine after being granted a\nsecurity clearance by the Department of Defense in 1981.\nIn August 1989 the Directorate for Industrial Security Clearance Review\n(predecessor agency to the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals) issued an SOR to\nthe Applicant proposing to revoke his security clearance. The SOR stated that the\nApplicant\u2019s drug abuse was one of the reasons he was not eligible for a security\nclearance. After a hearing, the Applicant was found ineligible for a security clearance in\na decision dated April 23, 1990. (Government Exhibit 1.)\nApplicant applied to have his security clearance renewed in 1994. In a letter\ndated May 28, 1994, Applicant gave various reasons about how his life has changed. In\nthis letter he said, \u201cI will not argue against any conclusions made in the determination,\nbut I will only state that I no longer consume alcohol or drugs, or participate in the\ntrafficking of any drug related products.\u201d (Government Exhibit 2 at 3.) Based on this\nstatement, and other evidence, the Applicant\u2019s security clearance was reinstated in\n1995. (Government Exhibit 2 at 1.)\nBeginning in approximately February 2001 and continuing to approximately\nSeptember 2008, the Applicant used marijuana again. According to the Applicant, his\nuse of marijuana was very infrequent. The last time the Applicant used drugs was\nSeptember 2008, with his brothers. (Transcript at 33-34.) (See Government Exhibit 4.)\nThe decision to begin using marijuana again, despite his prior history and knowledge\nthat it was inappropriate for security clearance holders, was his alone. (Transcript at\n\n3\n69.) He maintains that, on at least one occasion since then, he has turned down an\nopportunity to use marijuana. (Transcript at 41-44.) Applicant\u2019s last use of marijuana\noccurred after he filled out his last security clearance questionnaire, in March 2007.\nApplicant submitted a written statement, which states that he has not used any\nmarijuana since September 2008, he intends not to use illegal substances in the future,\nand he agrees that any future use of illegal substances will result in the automatic\nrevocation of his security clearance. (Applicant Exhibit A.)\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has engaged in conduct which displays questionable judgment,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.\nAs part of this allegation, the Government states that the Applicant\u2019s conduct in\nusing illegal drugs after initially being granted a clearance in 1981, and subsequent to\nhis security clearance being reinstated in 1995 (SOR 1.f. and 1.h.), is cognizable under\nthis paragraph as well. Accordingly, the findings entered under Paragraph 1 concerning\nthese allegations will be considered in determining the issues under this paragraph as\nwell.\nApplicant further admits that he was arrested for Indecent Exposure in December\n1999. He was convicted in April 2001 and sentenced to pay a fine, 30 days public\nservice, complete sex offender counseling and register as a sex offender. Applicant\nsuccessfully completed the sex offender counseling. He remains registered as a sex\noffender. (Transcript at 76-77.)\nMitigation\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor testified on his behalf. The witness testified that he has\nworked with the Applicant for almost two years, trusts the Applicant, and would like to\npromote him to positions of higher authority. The witness was particularly impressed\nwith the Applicant\u2019s forthrightness after receiving the SOR. The witness made the\ndecision that Applicant was still employable and could be trusted with classified\ninformation. (Transcript at 56-58.)\nThe alternate COSEC (Communication Security) manager for Applicant\u2019s\nemployer submitted a letter. He discussed the Applicant\u2019s job performance, stating\n\u201c[Applicant] is a valuable member to our division,\u201d and \u201cI have no reason to question his\nintegrity or job ethics in any way.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit A.)\nApplicant\u2019s mother testified on his behalf. She stated that the Applicant is honest\nand a man of integrity. He has been forthcoming with her about his problems and she\nbelieves that he has overcome them at this point in time. (Transcript at 60-66.)\nApplicant\u2019s wife also submitted a letter on the Applicant\u2019s behalf. (Applicant Exhibit C.)\n\n4\n \nApplicant submitted documentary evidence showing that he is a highly respected\nemployee. He was \u201cEmployee of the Quarter\u201d for the third quarter of 2009. (Applicant\nExhibits D and E; Transcript at 78-80.)\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are to be used as appropriate in evaluating an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.  In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his or her own common\nsense, as well as knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the world, in\nmaking a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\n\n5\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by the President in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865,\n\u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nParagraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement)\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in\nAG & 24:      \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both\nbecause it may impair judgment and because it raises questions about a\nperson's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nDrugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include:\n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed\nin the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or\ncannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2)\ninhalants and other similar substances; Drug abuse is the illegal use of a\ndrug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved\nmedical direction.\nI have considered the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 and especially find\nthat the following apply to this case:  \n(a) any drug abuse; \n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance; and\n(h) expressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and\nconvincingly commit to discontinue drug use. \nThe Applicant used marijuana on an infrequent basis, from 1979 until 1990, and\nagain from 2001 until approximately September 2008. During both periods he held a\nsecurity clearance, and knew his use of marijuana was inappropriate. Indeed, he used\nmarijuana after losing his security clearance in 1990, and having it restored in 1995. \n\n6\nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 and especially\nconsidered the following: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent or happened\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, and \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1)\ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or\navoiding the environment where drugs are used; (3) an appropriate period\nof abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of\nclearance for any violation. \nThe evidence is clear that the Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana were the actions of a\nmature person. Applicant stated several times that he would not use marijuana in the\nfuture, and submitted a signed statement to that affect. However, based on the facts of\nthis case, his statements do not carry much weight. Enough time has not passed for me\nto say with any degree of confidence that he will not use marijuana in the future. None\nof the mitigating conditions apply to this case.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nThe security concern relating to Personal Conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty or unwillingness to comply with rules or regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.\nThe entirety of the Applicant\u2019s conduct set forth under Paragraph 2, brings into\nplay disqualifying condition \u00b6 16(c) under Guideline E: \ncredible adverse information in several adjudicative areas that is not\nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline,\nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person\nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard\nprotected information.\nThe following mitigating conditions under Guideline E \u00b6 17 arguably apply to his\nconduct:\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment, and\n\n7\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\nApplicant\u2019s drug use, as described under Paragraph 1, above, is clearly\ninappropriate and cognizable under this Guideline. While it has been ten years since his\nsexual misconduct, Applicant still must register as a sex offender. He did discuss his\ncoping strategies, but the record is simply too thin on this point for me to find that his\nconduct was unique and in the past. It is the Applicant\u2019s burden to show that the\nmitigating conditions apply. He failed to do so. This guideline is found against the\nApplicant.\n \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination\nof whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person\nconcept. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.      \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. My findings under Paragraphs 1 and\n2, above, are also relevant to this discussion. The Applicant is a hard-working,\nrespected, professional who has engaged in occasional marijuana use for many years,\nand has a single arrest for indecent exposure in 1999. His drug use ended in the recent\npast, after he lost and regained his security clearance over that very issue. In viewing all\nthe facts of this case, I find that the Applicant has not mitigated the security significance\nof his prior conduct. I further find that there have not been permanent behavioral\nchanges under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6). In addition, I find that there is still potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b62(a)(8)), and that there is likelihood of recurrence\n(AG \u00b62(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude the Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his drug\n\n8\ninvolvement and personal conduct as expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the\nGovernment's Statement of Reasons.  \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.h:\nAgainst the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a. through 2.c:\nAgainst the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Hoffman, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant mitigated the government\u2019s financial considerations security concern.\nClearance is granted.\nOn February 13, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 1, 2009, admitting SOR subparagraphs\n1.a through 1.c and 1.f, and denying SOR subparagraphs 1.e and 1.g. He requested a\nhearing, and the case was assigned to me on April 2, 2009. On April 9, 2009, a Notice\nJuly 17, 2009\n\n2\nof Hearing was issued scheduling the case for May 5, 2009. The hearing was\nconducted as scheduled. I received five government exhibits, one Applicant exhibit, and\nthe testimony of six Applicant witnesses. At Applicant\u2019s request, I left the record open at\nthe conclusion of the hearing to allow him to submit additional exhibits. Within the time\nallotted, he submitted eight additional exhibits that I marked and received as Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits B through I. The transcript was received on May 15, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 53-year-old married man with one adult son. Applicant has earned\nsome college credits. He served in the U.S. Army from 1975 through his retirement in\n1997. He was honorably discharged. He is a Gulf War veteran.\nSince retiring from the Army, Applicant has worked as a cabling technician (Tr.\n163). He installs copper cables and fiber optic cables on unsecure and secure systems\nfor a government agency (Tr. 33). According to his supervisor, his character and work\nethic are above reproach (Tr. 136,140).\nIn 2003, Applicant experienced a work slowdown that resulted in a cut in pay (Tr.\n169). For the next three years, he made approximately $400 per month less than he\nhad earned previously (Id.). Since 2006, Applicant\u2019s income has gradually risen to the\n2003 level.\nIn 2004, Applicant\u2019s wife retired from her federal government job and began\ntraining to be an insurance agent. She financed her start-up costs by withdrawing\nmoney from her thrift savings plan (Tr. 122). She underestimated the income tax\nconsequences, and incurred a tax debt of approximately $24,000, as listed in SOR\nsubparagraph 1.g. Because Applicant and his wife filed income taxes jointly, this debt\nbegan appearing on his credit reports.\nApplicant\u2019s wife operated as an independent contractor for several insurance\ncompanies. Her income was based solely on commissions. As a fledgling business\nowner, she continued to struggle with income tax issues over the first two years of the\noperation (Tr. 53, 111). Consequently, her tax debt grew. Moreover, she struggled to\nbuild a client base, and did not begin to earn a profit until approximately 2006.\nAs Applicant\u2019s wife struggled to build her business, he grew increasingly\nresponsible for their debts, and gradually began falling behind (Tr. 111). At or about the\ntime Applicant\u2019s pay was cut and his wife\u2019s nascent business was struggling, their\nparents became disabled (Tr. 42). They then had to divert some of their income to\nassisting their parents with miscellaneous costs and occasional mortgage payments (Tr.\n122). \nBy 2006, Applicant and his wife had accrued approximately $66,000 of unpaid,\ndelinquent debt (Tr. 38). That same year, however, Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s business began to\nbecome profitable (Tr. 44). Since then, her success has been extraordinary. She has\n\n3\nearned as much as $40,000 monthly in commissions. Her client base has expanded to\ninclude high-net worth individuals and small business owners (Tr. 113). Her business\nnow includes financial counseling, and she has earned money from speaking\nengagements. Also, she has published a book. In 2006, her company honored her for\nbeing in the top five of its highest-producing insurance agents out of 4,000 nationally\n(Tr. 111).\nAs Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s business improved, they began addressing their debts.\nNearly $61,000 of their debt is owed to two creditors, the federal government, as\ndescribed earlier in the Decision, and a bank, as listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.d and\n1.f. By the end of 2007, the federal tax debt had reached $35,000, and the government\nhad begun garnishing Applicant\u2019s wages (Tr. 111). In late 2008, Applicant\u2019s wife paid\n$9,000 toward its satisfaction using a commission earned from retaining a client (Tr.\n60). Applicant and his wife then negotiated a release of the lien (Tr. 61). In February\n2009, the federal government released the lien and stopped garnishing Applicant\u2019s\nwages (Answer, Attachment 8). Consistent with their agreement, Applicant and his wife\npay $415 monthly toward the tax debt. Applicant\u2019s wife now works with an accountant to\nensure that her past tax problems do not recur (Tr. 107).\nThe bank debt as listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.d and 1.f was originally two\nseparate accounts. SOR subparagraph 1.d was a credit card, and SOR subparagraph\n1.f was a home equity credit line that Applicant and his wife used, among other things,\nto finance their son\u2019s college education (Tr. 121). After the creditor filed suit, Applicant\nand his wife negotiated a settlement whereupon they agreed to pay $33,000 in monthly\n$750 increments, beginning in February 2009, to be completed in September 2009.\nUnder the agreement, the last payment will constitute approximately $27,000.\nApplicant\u2019s wife intentionally structured the settlement to have a disproportionately high\nfinal payment. She anticipates receiving a particularly high commission the month the\nfinal payment is due (Tr. 99, 110). Applicant and his wife have been making payments\nas scheduled (Exhibit I at 3). \nSOR subparagraph 1.a is a delinquent cell phone bill in the amount of $633.\nApplicant satisfied this debt in full in March 2009 (Answer, Attachment 3). \nSOR subparagraph 1.b is a credit card account with a delinquent balance of\napproximately $3,800, and a past due monthly payment of $598. In February 2009,\nApplicant contacted the creditor and arranged a payment plan whereupon he will pay\n$200 per month until the entire balance is satisfied. Since then, he has been making\npayments of between $200 and $250 per month (Answer, Attachment 4; Exhibit H; Tr.\n84). The account is no longer past due.\nSOR subparagraph 1.c is a delinquent debt owed to a credit card company in the\namount of $844. By December 19, 2008, Applicant had satisfied this debt entirely\nthrough monthly payments (Exhibit A).\n\nAt the height of the real estate market, they had $750,000 of equity in the home.\n1\n4\nSOR 1.e, a $2,000 debt owed to a towing company, is not Applicant\u2019s\nresponsibility. Instead, his son, who shares his name, accrued this debt. Nevertheless,\nApplicant contacted the creditor in February 2009, negotiated a settlement, and satisfied\nthe debt, consistent with the settlement terms, by March 2009 (Answer, Attachment 7;\nExhibit G).\nBoth of Applicant\u2019s parents, and his father-in-law are now deceased (Tr. 42, 126).\nApplicant and his wife contacted an elder advocacy group to negotiate a decrease in his\nmother-in-law\u2019s monthly mortgage payments so that she could handle it herself (Tr.\n127).\nApplicant and his wife earn approximately $180,000 annually (Tr. 44). They have\n$500,000 of equity in their home (Tr. 120).  Recently, he inherited a home worth\n1\napproximately $80,000 with a remaining $3,000 mortgage (Tr. 97). Also, his wife\nrecently inherited a home worth approximately $80,000 that is not encumbered with a\nmortgage (Id).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common-sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information (AG\n\u00b6 18). Here, Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6\n19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s finances were strained by a 2003 pay cut and difficulties in supporting\nelderly relatives. Also, his financial struggles corresponded with his wife\u2019s struggle to\nbuild a new business at or about the time he experienced the pay cut.\nApplicant\u2019s income has returned to the 2003 rate. His wife\u2019s business has\nbecome exceedingly profitable. In the past three years, they have either satisfied their\ndelinquencies or negotiated payment plans to which they have been adhering. The\nfollowing mitigating conditions apply: AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d 20(c), \u201c. . . there are\nclear indications that the problem is being resolved, or is under control,\u201d and 20(d), \u201cthe\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts.\u201d\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant did not accrue the most significant debt, the income tax delinquency.\nInstead, it was accrued by his wife after she underestimated the income tax\nconsequences of withdrawing money from her thrift savings plan. Now that her business\n\n6\nhas grown profitable, she has retained an accountant to ensure that she has no more\nincome tax problems.\nApplicant has addressed the financial challenges posed by his elderly relatives\nby consulting an elder advocacy group to help them manage their finances. He and his\nwife are satisfying the tax debt and the home equity credit line debt through negotiated\nagreements. Although Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s business is lucrative, I found Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s\nincome projections for the remainder of the year to be overly optimistic. Consequently, I\nam somewhat skeptical of their projected final payment, toward the satisfaction of the\nhome equity line of credit, of between $25,000 and $30,000. However, they own three\nhomes with a combined equity of nearly $700,000. If Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s income proves to\nbe less than anticipated, they have ample resources in reserve which they could use to\nsatisfy the debt.\nUpon evaluating this case in the context of the whole person concept, I conclude\nApplicant has mitigated the financial considerations security concern.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Finding\nno harmful error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following findings of fact: Applicant is an imagery intelligence analyst\nemployed by a federal contractor.  He is married and has four adult children, one of whom lives with\nApplicant while attending college.  Applicant has four grandchildren.  One of the grandchildren has\na father who provides some support.  Applicant contributes to his grandchildren\u2019s households.  \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts, including one for over $24,000 for an automobile.\nThe Judge found that Applicant and his wife have experienced periods of unemployment and have\nsuffered from medical problems, all of which have contributed to Applicant\u2019s financial condition.\nApplicant was discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1997, which resulted from his being held liable\nfor $20,000 in a dispute over a real estate transaction.  Applicant lost a second house in 2000, due\nto diminished income when his work hours were reduced.   He lost a government job in 2004, when\n1\nhe failed to qualify for a security clearance.  He was laid off from another job in 2007, when the\ncontract he was working on was terminated.  \nIn addition to the automobile debt, Applicant and his wife have approximately $4,850 in\nundisputed debt which they have not yet addressed.  Applicant has become more involved in the\nfamily\u2019s finances recently, and he and his wife have consulted a financial counselor.  They have\ndevised a budget, which includes funds for payments on the automobile debt.  \u201cTheir current budget\nreflects that Applicant\u2019s current position provides him with a higher compensation package than he\nreceived in prior years . . . The majority of progress made by Applicant and his wife toward their\ndelinquent debts and credit report was made possible by Applicant\u2019s acquisition of his current\nposition and recent financial guidance.  \nThe Judge acknowledged that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were due in large measure to\ncauses outside his control.  However, the Judge stated that Applicant had not demonstrated a track\nrecord of actual debt repayment.  See ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008); ISCR\nCase No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999).  He noted, for example, that Applicant\u2019s financial\nplan is at least partially dependent on contingent future income such as overtime pay and a possible\ntax refund, which may not materialize.  The Judge concluded that Applicant had not met his burden\nof persuasion as to mitigation.\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in some of his findings.  For example, Applicant\nchallenges the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant\u2019s diminished income in 2000 caused him to lose a\nhouse.  Applicant states that it was his wife, not he, who experienced that problem.  The record\nevidence demonstrates that Applicant\u2019s contention is correct.  See Applicant Exhibit E, Time-line\nof Events, at 1.  The Judge\u2019s finding is in error.  However, as Applicant himself acknowledges in his\nbrief, this error did not likely affect the outcome of the case.  Therefore, it is harmless.  See ISCR\n01-23362 (App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006); ISCR Case No. 03-09915 (App. Bd. Dec. 16, 2004); ISCR Case\nNo. 01-11192 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2002).  Applicant also challenges the Judge\u2019s statement that his\ncurrent job is more lucrative than his previous ones have been.  Applicant contends that the Judge\u2019s\n\nstatement does not take into account the fact that his wife no longer works, with the result that his\noverall disposable income is less than he believes the Judge understood it to be.  The Board has\nexamined this finding.  It was based on an exhibit provided by Applicant, the household budget.\nViewed in that light and in the context of Applicant\u2019s presentation of his many financial setbacks,\nthe Judge\u2019s finding is not an unreasonable interpretation of Applicant\u2019s current financial situation.\nHowever, even if the Judge erred, we conclude that the error is also harmless.\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, both as to the mitigating conditions and\nthe whole-person factors.  The decision draws  \u201ca \u2018rational connection between the facts found and\nthe choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.

Applicant lost a second house in 2000, due to diminished income when his work hours were reduced. He lost a government job in 2004, when 1 he failed to qualify for a security clearance. He was laid off from another job in 2007, when the contract he was working on was terminated. In addition to the automobile debt, Applicant and his wife have approximately $4,850 in undisputed debt which they have not yet addressed. Applicant has become more involved in the family\u2019s finances recently, and he and his wife have consulted a financial counselor. They have devised a budget, which includes funds for payments on the automobile debt. \u201cTheir current budget reflects that Applicant\u2019s current position provides him with a higher compensation package than he received in prior years . . . The majority of progress made by Applicant and his wife toward their delinquent debts and credit report was made possible by Applicant\u2019s acquisition of his current position and recent financial guidance. The Judge acknowledged that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were due in large measure to causes outside his control. However, the Judge stated that Applicant had not demonstrated a track record of actual debt repayment. See ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999). He noted, for example, that Applicant\u2019s financial plan is at least partially dependent on contingent future income such as overtime pay and a possible tax refund, which may not materialize. The Judge concluded that Applicant had not met his burden of persuasion as to mitigation. Applicant contends that the Judge erred in some of his findings. For example, Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant\u2019s diminished income in 2000 caused him to lose a house. Applicant states that it was his wife, not he, who experienced that problem. The record evidence demonstrates that Applicant\u2019s contention is correct. See Applicant Exhibit E, Time-line of Events, at 1. The Judge\u2019s finding is in error. However, as Applicant himself acknowledges in his brief, this error did not likely affect the outcome of the case. Therefore, it is harmless. See ISCR 01-23362 (App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006); ISCR Case No. 03-09915 (App. Bd. Dec. 16, 2004); ISCR Case No. 01-11192 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2002). Applicant also challenges the Judge\u2019s statement that his current job is more lucrative than his previous ones have been. Applicant contends that the Judge\u2019s statement does not take into account the fact that his wife no longer works, with the result that his overall disposable income is less than he believes the Judge understood it to be. The Board has examined this finding. It was based on an exhibit provided by Applicant, the household budget. Viewed in that light and in the context of Applicant\u2019s presentation of his many financial setbacks, the Judge\u2019s finding is not an unreasonable interpretation of Applicant\u2019s current financial situation. However, even if the Judge erred, we conclude that the error is also harmless. After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, both as to the mitigating conditions and the whole-person factors. The decision draws \u201ca \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.

The Judge\u2019s decision that \u201cit is not clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance\u201d is sustainable on this record.

On April 30, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) enumerating security concerns arising under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended,\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005,\nwhich are effective for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nIn a June 8, 2009, response, Applicant admitted four of the 11 allegations,\ndenied six of the allegations, and declined to admit or deny one of the allegations set\nforth in the SOR. Each allegation concerned a different delinquent debt attributed to\nApplicant. He requested a hearing on the matter. DOHA assigned the case to me on\nJune 26, 2009. Department Counsel and Applicant agreed to a hearing date of July 15,\n2009. A notice of hearing was issued to that effect on July 6, 2009. I convened the\nhearing as scheduled. Applicant confirmed his desire to proceed with the hearing and\nSeptember 30, 2009\n\n Tr. 11.\n      1\n Department Counsel initially objected to Ex. F on the basis of relevance, but stated no objection to it being\n      2\nadmitted if given limited weight. The exhibit was admitted on that basis. Tr. 64-66.\n Tr. 82.\n      3\n Tr. 44. Applicant\u2019s youngest child, who provides significant day care on weekends, described Applicant\u2019s\n      4\nwife\u2019s care for the grandchildren as \u201cmy mom\u2019s full-time job.\u201d Tr. 57.\n2\nwaive the 15-day notice requirement.  Applicant was accompanied by his wife, who,\n1\nalong with three others, gave witness testimony. Applicant offered seven exhibits (Exs.),\nwhich were admitted without objection as Exs. A-G.  He was initially given through July\n2\n31, 2009, to submit any additional documentation, then given leave to request an\nextension to August 7, 2009, if needed.  Department Counsel offered seven documents\n3\nadmitted as exhibits (Exs.) 1-7 without objection. The transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding\nwas received on July 23, 2009. On July 24, 2009, Applicant sent Department Counsel\nfour additional documents by facsimile transmission. They were forwarded to me on\nAugust 4, 2009, and received on August 5, 2009. Those additional documents were\nadmitted without objection as Exs. H-K. The record was closed on August 10, 2009.\nBased on a review of the testimony, submissions, and exhibits, I find Applicant failed to\nmeet his burden regarding the financial security concerns raised. Security clearance is\ndenied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 47-year-old imagery intelligence analyst who has worked for the\nsame defense contractor for approximately two years. Applicant earned a high school\ndiploma and completed some college courses. Married, Applicant has three adult\nchildren who live independently. A fourth child, his 19-year-old daughter, remains at\nhome and attends college. Applicant also has four grandchildren by his adult children.\nOnly the father of one of the grandchildren provides any financial support. Although all\nof his children work, two experienced layoffs between January and about June 2009.\nApplicant\u2019s wife left the workforce about a year ago so she can provide day care and\nmeals for her grandchildren, whose single mothers work in low-paying positions.4\nApplicant chooses to financially contribute to his grandchildren\u2019s care and households. \nApplicant and his wife met when they were 20 and 19 years of age, respectively.\nBoth were serving in the United States (U.S.) military at the time. They married in 1981.\nApplicant was medically discharged in 1989. It took him nearly a year to find\nemployment. He started a government job at the GS-9 level. While he was\nunemployed, however, his first child was born. Lacking health insurance coverage,\nApplicant and his wife expended the $18,000 he received as military severance pay on\nthe baby\u2019s birth and to cover their daily cost of living. \nIn 1994, Applicant started a different job within the defense industry. Between\n1995 and 1996, Applicant put down all his available funds toward a house for his\ngrowing family of six. It was obtained under a lease-purchase agreement. At the time,\n\n Tr. 87-88.\n      5\n Ex. E (Critical Times Timeline); Tr. 88.\n      6\n Ex. E, supra, note 6.\n      7\n Id.\n      8\n Tr. 73. Applicant was interviewed by investigators about his finances in 2005 and 2008. \n      9\n At the time, Applicant\u2019s wife was earning approximately $14 per hour. Tr. 74.\n      10\n3\nhe was unaware as to how such agreements work. When the family moved in, they\nfound the house had so many structural problems, they would have to take a second\nmortgage to make necessary repairs.  Consequently, Applicant expressed a desire to\n5\nend the arrangement, thinking that would end matters. The owner eventually sold the\nhouse for less than agreed upon price, however, and Applicant was deemed liable for\nthe discrepancy of close to $20,000. Unrepresented, Applicant failed to understand\nsome of the court documents and failed to execute his case properly. When he lost the\ncase, his appeal was denied.  As a result, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy,\n6\nwhich was discharged in about 1997.\nIn 1998, Applicant shattered his wrists and broke his elbow in three places after\nfalling 15 to 20 feet through an attic floor. After two surgeries, he still had nerve\ndamage. He spent nearly a year in rehabilitative braces and therapy. As a result, he lost\nhis job, incurred extensive medical bills, and was unemployed for about six months.\nBy April 2000, Applicant was gainfully employed and bought a house. Due to the\nearlier bankruptcy, the mortgage rate was high. The month after they moved in, his\nemployer\u2019s company was bought out and he was reduced to 20 hours of work per\nweek.  With his pay proportionately reduced, Applicant could not make timely mortgage\n7\npayments. He lost the house soon thereafter.\nAlthough he started government service as a GS-9 employee in around 1990,\nApplicant had risen to the GS-14 level by the early 2000s. Owing to his then-existing\nfinancial problems, however, he was severed from his position in April 2004 for failing to\nqualify for a security clearance. He then faced a significant period of unemployment of\nabout half a year before finding work within the defense contracting industry toward\nmid-autumn of 2004. While unemployed, the family lived off his wife\u2019s salary and her\nretirement savings.  Applicant was ultimately laid off from his next position in May 2007\n8\nwhen the contract he was working on was terminated.  He remained unemployed for at\n9\nleast four months, during which time he and his wife lived off her salary  and money\n10\nleft to Applicant through his late father\u2019s estate.\nApplicant\u2019s wife exclusively maintains the family\u2019s accounts, pays their bills, and\nprovides pocket money for her husband and children. She has endeavored to minimize\ntheir acquisition of additional delinquent debt. Until recently, Applicant was not informed\n\n See, e.g., Tr. 28.\n      11\n This purchase was made in order to acquire transportation for their growing family that was safe and more\n      12\nreliable than their  two 15-year-old vehicles.\n Ex. C (Payment History); Tr. 32-33, 59.\n      13\n W hen asked whether they had evidence that the car was paid off, Applicant\u2019s wife stated: \u201cIf we do, it\u2019s\n      14\nin storage where we couldn\u2019t find it, but we have had numerous - - we had stuff going back and forth. They\ndon\u2019t contact us. . . . It\u2019s just something that I can\u2019t seem to get off my credit report.\u201d Tr. 34-35. Prior disputes\nwere directly with the creditor. It was formally disputed with Equifax in July 2009. Ex. H (Dispute Screen\nCapture, Equifax, dated Jul. 23, 2009).\n Tr. 37; Post-Hearing Submission Cover Letter. W hen Applicant tried to dispute the matter with Equifax\n      15\nin July 2009, it was discovered the account, described in Ex. 4 (Credit Report, dated Dec. 28, 2007) as having\nan activity date of July 2007,is no longer on their credit report. See, e.g., Ex. 3 (Credit Report, dated Mar. 20,\n2009).\n Post Hearing Submission Cover Letter; Ex. I (Credit Report Negative/Closed Accounts). It is notable that\n      16\nthis disputed entry was removed within the past two years, indicating it was not removed as a stale entry  of\nseven years or older. \n For original obligation with the telecommunications entity, see Ex. 4 (Credit Report, dated Dec. 28, 2007)\n      17\nat 8, noting the account as having a date of last activity in June 2008.\n Tr. 41-42.\n      18\n4\nas to the status of the family finances unless circumstances became truly dire.  In the\n11\npast, she worked to minimize the acquisition of new debts. With Applicant\u2019s latest\nposition, however, there was a rise in salary. Now, she is attempting to sort through\ntheir old debts with the goal of addressing them. She is currently focusing on paying off\ntheir most significant debt first, a 2006 automobile-related obligation noted as SOR \u00b6\n1.d for approximately $24,800.  Toward that debt, bi-weekly payments of $300 have\n12\nbeen directly paid from their household account since about mid-May 2009.  They are\n13\nhoping to pay the credit card debts noted at SOR \u00b6 1.a ($823) and \u00b6 1.b ($1,216) with\nthe overtime Applicant expects from out-of-town work in August 2009 and October\n2009. \nWhile committed to honoring all legitimate debts, Applicant and his wife disputed\nand continue to dispute the account noted at SOR allegation \u00b6 1.e ($4,928), an account\nthey previously paid off.  They were prepared to dispute the account noted at SOR \u00b6\n14\n1.h ($314) for insurance coverage charged for a month following their cancellation of\nthe policy in 2007.  As of March 20, 2009, however, that account entry is no longer\n15\nnoted on their credit report.  \n16\nApplicant also disputed the allegation noted at SOR \u00b6 1.k ($166) for a\ntelecommunications balance with a 2007 activity date and which was subsequently held\nby a collection agency.  Applicant and his wife both deny having used this company.\n17\nApplicant\u2019s wife affirmed that the debt was disputed a few years ago.  It no longer\n18\nappears on their credit report under either the telecommunications entity\u2019s name nor the\n\n See Ex. 3 (Credit Report, dated Mar. 20, 2009).\n      19\n Tr. 38.\n      20\n Ex. K (Clinic Statement); Tr. 38.\n      21\n Tr. 39. Applicant was previously told he had no balance owed, but provided no evidence to that effect.\n      22\nTr. 40.\n Applicant\u2019s wife testified that this debt is earmarked for payment with their next tax refund in February\n      23\n2010. Tr. 42.\n Tr. 43. Applicant does possess a company credit card, but it is reserved for business related expenses.\n      24\n Tr. 48-50.\n      25\n5\ncollection agent\u2019s name.  Inasmuch as the entry was removed in under seven years, it\n19\nmay be concluded the dispute was successful.\nAnother disputed account concerns a debt owed to a bank cited at SOR\nallegation \u00b6 1.g ($261). Applicant\u2019s wife complained to the bank that it was not crediting\nher deposits before first entering her debits, triggering overdrafts. The bank is no longer\nin existence. She is willing to pay the balance, but is unsure whether she should pay the\nsuccessor bank or the collection agent noted in her credit report.  She seeks to clarify\n20\nthe situation through dispute.\nWithin the past two years, Applicant began experiencing soreness in his\nshoulder. During what was initially thought to be a routine surgery, it was discovered he\nhad multiple bone spurs, a torn rotator cuff, and a torn bicep tendon. Rather than\nrecovering with the use of a sling for three days, his recuperation kept him from work for\nabout a week and limited his dexterity and general ability to perform manual functions\nfor about seven weeks. SOR allegation \u00b6 1.i ($140) is for medical services rendered to\nApplicant related to that procedure. Evidence was submitted showing that this clinic\naccount has a zero balance.  SOR allegation \u00b6 1.j ($312) is also for related or\n21\nconcurrent medical obligations, but has yet to be paid.22\nIn sum, Applicant confirms that they have yet to address and do properly owe\nthose debts cited at SOR allegations \u00b6 1.c ($1,180)  and \u00b6 1.f ($1,666), along with the\n23\npreviously referenced debts noted at \u00b6 1.a ($823) and \u00b6 1.b ($1,216). Consequently,\nApplicant concedes approximately $4,850 in undisputed debt has yet to be addressed.\nNeither Applicant nor his wife have any other personal credit card balances outstanding\nand do not currently use personal credit cards.  They have no outstanding loans or\n24\nobligations except for monthly payments of $119 for their youngest daughter\u2019s braces,\ntoward which their daughter contributes financially.\nApplicant\u2019s employer has no concerns regarding Applicant\u2019s suitability, noting\nApplicant \u201chas been a very trusted guy on a fairly important program.\u201d  In stating that\n25\nhe has no qualms concerning any of his employees, he noted that \u201cif I have qualms\n\n Tr. 48.\n      26\n Tr. 51-53.\n      27\n Exs. A-B (References).\n      28\n Tr. 67. \n      29\n Id.\n      30\n Id.\n      31\n  Post Hearing Submission Cover Letter.\n      32\n Ex. A (Budget).\n      33\n Given the low pay earned by his three eldest children, Applicant referred to himself as supporting a\n      34\nhousehold of 10, to include his wife, children, and grandchildren. Tr. 77.\n Tr. 83. Department Counsel correctly notes that the automobile loan remained largely unaddressed until\n      35\nmid-spring 2009.\n6\nabout [people], I don\u2019t hire them.\u201d  Applicant has also earned the trust and confidence\n26\nof his security officer, who noted that Applicant has been \u201cvery up front\u201d with regard to\nhis financial issues.  Other professional references are equally positive.  \n27\n28\nToday, Applicant now takes an active role in the management of his family\u2019s\nfinances.  He and his wife received financial counseling, where they learned to be\n29\npersistent and consistent in their debt payments.  As a result, he and his wife have\n30\nactively discussed \u201chow we can strap down and tighten things up\u201d financially.  It is their\n31\nintent to honor all legitimate obligations. In the past year, they devised a detailed\nmonthly budget which includes payments on their largest delinquent debt, their car loan\nobligation. That plan appears to have been implemented in about May 2009. They also\nuse two highly popular personal finance guides \u201cas guidelines to improve [their]\nfinancial situation.\u201d  Their budget reflects the fact that Applicant\u2019s current position\n32\nprovides him with a higher compensation package than he received in prior years. He\ncurrently earns approximately $95,000 per year with a net monthly salary of\napproximately $4,690. After rent, insurance, automobile debt payments (regarding the\naccount noted at SOR \u00b6 1.d), electric, telephone, internet/cable, water, and sewage,\nApplicant has a net remainder of approximately $1,850 a month or $462.50 a week to\ndevote to their household expenses, meals, and, potentially, their payments toward\ntheir thus far unaddressed delinquent debt of approximately $4,850.  It also serves as\n33\nthe financial basis from which Applicant chooses to contribute toward his children and\ngrandchildren.  \n34\nThe majority of progress made by Applicant and his wife toward their delinquent\ndebts and credit report was made possible by Applicant\u2019s acquisition of his current\nposition and recent financial guidance. As noted by Department Counsel, Applicant and\nhis wife have recently \u201cbegun to address some of the debts the government has\nconcerns with . . .\u201d  Applicant\u2019s wife has devised a financial plan to be executed over\n35\n\n Ex.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n      39\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n      40\n7\nthe next two to three years that aims to address their remaining delinquent debt and,\nultimately, buy a house.  In the past year or two, they made some gains clearing up\n36\ninaccuracies and paying off some minor debts not at issue on their credit reports.37\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions. These guidelines are not\ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these\nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process.\nThe administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and\ncommonsense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge\nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in\nthe SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n38\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n39\n40\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information.

Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b). \u201cThe clearly consistent\nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on\nthe side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be\n41\nallowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting that\ninformation.42\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) to be the most pertinent to this case. Conditions pertaining to this\nadjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as\nwell as those which would mitigate such concerns, are set forth and discussed below.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations\nUnder Guideline F, failure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or an\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.43\nThe Directive sets out several potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline. \nOwing to a string of mishaps over the past 15 to 20 years, Applicant acquired a\nnumber of debts. Eleven of those debts became delinquent. Although most of those\ndebts are relatively modest, one is approximately $24,800. They are presently making\nprogress on this highly significant debt and only four of their smaller debts remain\nunaddressed. Despite this progress, these facts are sufficient to raise financial\nconsiderations disqualifying condition (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts\u201d) and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d).\nWith such conditions raised, the burden shifts to Applicant to overcome the case\nagainst him and mitigate security concerns. \nApplicant\u2019s most recent delinquent debt was the result of several significant\nevents that occurred between 1998 and 2007. In 1998, Applicant was physically injured\nin a fall that required extensive rehabilitation. As a result, he lost his job and faced a\nperiod of unemployment. In 2000, his work hours were cut in half shortly after taking\n\n In addition, three of Applicant\u2019s children, who work in near-minimum wage jobs, bore children they could\n      44\nnot afford. Applicant chose to provide them with financial assistance. W hile generously paternal and highly\nlaudable, this choice was made with full knowledge of his own financial difficulties. For scrutiny under this\nguideline, this volitional act cannot be considered a condition \u201cbeyond his control.\u201d\n The overtime pay accrued in August and October 2009 is earmarked for application to those debts\n      45\nidentified at SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b.\n9\npossession of a new home. As a result, he lost the home and was forced to live on a\nsubstantially reduced income. In 2004, he was terminated from a position due to his\ninability to maintain a security clearance because of his financial situation. He then\nfaced a significant period of unemployment lasting about a half of a year. This only\nworsened his then-current financial situation and prohibited him from making any\nprogress toward his past debts. In 2007, he was laid off from his job when the contract\non which he was working was terminated. Again, a period of several months of\nunemployment followed. Throughout, Applicant and his wife have tried to minimize the\nacquisition of additional debt. Such facts give rise to financial considerations mitigating\ncondition (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d).  \n44\nUnbeknownst to Applicant, Applicant\u2019s wife was doing her best to meet their\nexpenses, but she chose not to inform her husband of their often precarious financial\nsituation. After 2004, he became aware his finances were an issue. Before progress\ncould be made, he was laid off and experienced a period of unemployment in 2007.\nShortly thereafter, his wife left the workforce to provide daycare for her grandchildren in\norder to eliminate day care expenses. When Applicant assumed his current position in\nlate 2007, he found himself in a more lucrative position than in the past. Having\nreceived financial counseling and with the aid of two popular personal finance books,\nthey have since endeavored to dispute suspected inaccuracies on their credit report.\nWith those inaccurate entries identified, they then focused on the one obligation that\nrepresents the great majority of their debt: the automobile debt. They negotiated a\nrepayment plan and commenced monthly payments toward that debt in about mid-May\n2009.\nFurthermore, with their newly found financial knowledge, Applicant and his wife\nalso developed a firm, but flexible, budget that fully integrates their automobile debt\u2019s\npayments. It appears to have been implemented with their first car-related debt in May\n2009. Depending on the amount of funds Applicant chooses to contribute to his children\nand grandchildren, it has the ability to leave him with sufficient funds leftover each\nmonth to make modest, but regular, progress on his remaining debts. Moreover, they\nhave anticipated significant periods of overtime to be acquired between August 2009\nand the spring of 2010, earmarking those potentially increased pay checks for satisfying\nspecific debts.  They have also identified which debt will be paid off with an anticipated\n45\nFebruary 2010 tax refund. Further, the couple devised and submitted a comprehensive\n\n10\nplan to be implemented over the next two to three years. Under that plan, and\nassuming their projections are correct, they aim to become solvent within the next year. \nAs of today, progress is being made toward the automobile debt and some\ndisputed credit report entries have already been successful. The overtime anticipated\nfrom August may already be acquired and Applicant should be poised for an\nopportunity to undertake overtime work in October. If such overtime is paid, it could\nprepare them to satisfy the first two debts at issue in the SOR.\nAlong with the initial payments made on the automobile debt, Applicant\nsuccessfully disputed two account entries, is awaiting action on two disputes, and has\nsatisfied one medical debt. The only debts upon which progress remains uninitiated are\nfour in number, representing a combined total just under $5,000. These accounts are\nincluded in the couple\u2019s immediate solvency plan, but that plan remains highly\ncontingent on the unguaranteed expectation of future overtime and a tax refund.\nConsequently, while FC MC \u00b6 20(d) (\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d) may apply, FC MC \u00b6 20(c) (\u201cthe person\nhas received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d) does not. No other\nmitigating conditions apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance\nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the\nguidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors. Speaking in Applicant\u2019s favor is the fact that he is a mature man with a well\nregarded and professionally acknowledged skill in his particular field. He is a devoted\nfamily man who continues to care for his children and their off-spring. Indeed, to his\n\n, See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a).\n      46\n11\nown detriment, he has further extended himself by laudably providing financial\nassistance to his adult children and their children despite his own monetary problems.\nWhile he experienced a string of ill luck over the years, he is no longer in the position of\nacquiring new debt, delinquent or otherwise. Applicant and his wife have given up their\nuse of credit cards and employed economizing measures at home never before\nimplemented. More importantly, Applicant is now in a more lucrative position than ever\nbefore. \nApplicant\u2019s current salary gives him the financial resources to finally begin\naddressing his old delinquent debts in earnest, just as his new found understanding of\npersonal finances has helped him identify the many inaccuracies on his credit report.\nWhat he makes of this opportunity remains to be seen, particularly since much of their\nfuture financial planning is dependent on income which is thus far unrealized (ie.\novertime and a tax refund). At present, of the 11 delinquent debts at issue, he recently\nstarted repayment on his largest obligation. Two disputed accounts were removed from\nhis credit report while two remain in dispute. One of two medical accounts was shown\nto have a zero balance. All that remains to be demonstrated is an established track\nrecord of continued, timely payments on his auto loan repayment plan, and the income\nto actually honor the debts identified in SOR allegations \u00b6 1.a ($823), \u00b6 1.b ($1,216),\u00b6\n1.c ($1,180) and \u00b6 1.f ($1,666). Assuming his budget and financial plan continue as\nnow directed, he should be able to address these issues within the next year. \nSpeaking against Applicant is the fact that financial problems have dogged him\nfor the past 15 to 20 years. He was forced to declare bankruptcy after finding he was\nout of his element regarding his handling of a 1995-1996 lease-purchase agreement on\na home and in defending himself in the subsequent litigation. While bankruptcy gave\nhim a clean slate, several legitimate and unavoidable intervening events impeded his\nprogress toward maintaining financial fitness. It is true that events have turned around\nin the past two years and the family has employed genuine economizing measures.\nCases from the appeal board, however, have intimated that evidence of only three or\nfour months on a repayment plan, especially when involving such a large obligation as\nthe one identified at SOR allegation \u00b6 1.d, is generally several months short of\nestablishing a true track record of timely payment. Such cases also state that future\nexpectations of income are not substitutes for actual payment or genuine and\nmeasured progress. \nThere is no doubt that progress has been made, nor is there doubt that more\nprogress remains to be made. In this process, however, the benefit of a doubt cannot\nbe substituted for a genuine track record of increasing success. Here, Applicant\nsuccessfully halted his downward financial spiral. He is now making strides to regain his\nfooting and work his way back to solvency. In these proceedings, the administrative\njudge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation, as well\nas his or her actions, in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for debt\nreduction is credible and realistic.  Here, Applicant presented a credible and realistic\n46\n\n An adverse determination does not necessarily speak ill of an applicant\u2019s loyalty, integrity, or diligence.\n      47\nAs here, it only indicates that the applicant failed to meet his or her burden in mitigating the security concerns\nat issue.\n12\nbudget. His financial plan at this point, however, is too contingent on unrealized income.\nTherefore, whether it is realistic remains to be seen. As noted above, the clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should\n47\nbe allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting that\ninformation. Consequently, I find that Applicant failed to mitigate financial\nconsiderations security concerns. With security concerns regarding his finances\ncurrently remaining, I conclude it is not clearly consistent with national security to grant\nApplicant a security clearance. Clearance is denied. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance is denied.\nARTHUR E.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On April 30, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On September 30, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Arthur E.\nMarshall, Jr., denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of\nfact were based upon substantial record evidence; whether the Judge erred in his application of the\npertinent mitigating factors; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis was erroneous.  Finding\nno harmful error, we affirm.\n\nSee discussion below.  \n1\n2\nThe Judge made the following findings of fact: Applicant is an imagery intelligence analyst\nemployed by a federal contractor.  He is married and has four adult children, one of whom lives with\nApplicant while attending college.  Applicant has four grandchildren.  One of the grandchildren has\na father who provides some support.  Applicant contributes to his grandchildren\u2019s households.  \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts, including one for over $24,000 for an automobile.\nThe Judge found that Applicant and his wife have experienced periods of unemployment and have\nsuffered from medical problems, all of which have contributed to Applicant\u2019s financial condition.\nApplicant was discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1997, which resulted from his being held liable\nfor $20,000 in a dispute over a real estate transaction.  Applicant lost a second house in 2000, due\nto diminished income when his work hours were reduced.   He lost a government job in 2004, when\n1\nhe failed to qualify for a security clearance.  He was laid off from another job in 2007, when the\ncontract he was working on was terminated.  \nIn addition to the automobile debt, Applicant and his wife have approximately $4,850 in\nundisputed debt which they have not yet addressed.  Applicant has become more involved in the\nfamily\u2019s finances recently, and he and his wife have consulted a financial counselor.  They have\ndevised a budget, which includes funds for payments on the automobile debt.  \u201cTheir current budget\nreflects that Applicant\u2019s current position provides him with a higher compensation package than he\nreceived in prior years . . . The majority of progress made by Applicant and his wife toward their\ndelinquent debts and credit report was made possible by Applicant\u2019s acquisition of his current\nposition and recent financial guidance.  \nThe Judge acknowledged that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were due in large measure to\ncauses outside his control.  However, the Judge stated that Applicant had not demonstrated a track\nrecord of actual debt repayment.  See ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008); ISCR\nCase No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999).  He noted, for example, that Applicant\u2019s financial\nplan is at least partially dependent on contingent future income such as overtime pay and a possible\ntax refund, which may not materialize.  The Judge concluded that Applicant had not met his burden\nof persuasion as to mitigation.\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in some of his findings.  For example, Applicant\nchallenges the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant\u2019s diminished income in 2000 caused him to lose a\nhouse.  Applicant states that it was his wife, not he, who experienced that problem.  The record\nevidence demonstrates that Applicant\u2019s contention is correct.  See Applicant Exhibit E, Time-line\nof Events, at 1.  The Judge\u2019s finding is in error.  However, as Applicant himself acknowledges in his\nbrief, this error did not likely affect the outcome of the case.  Therefore, it is harmless.  See ISCR\n01-23362 (App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006); ISCR Case No. 03-09915 (App. Bd. Dec. 16, 2004); ISCR Case\nNo. 01-11192 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2002).  Applicant also challenges the Judge\u2019s statement that his\ncurrent job is more lucrative than his previous ones have been.  Applicant contends that the Judge\u2019s\nstatement does not take into account the fact that his wife no longer works, with the result that his\n\n3\noverall disposable income is less than he believes the Judge understood it to be.  The Board has\nexamined this finding.  It was based on an exhibit provided by Applicant, the household budget.\nViewed in that light and in the context of Applicant\u2019s presentation of his many financial setbacks,\nthe Judge\u2019s finding is not an unreasonable interpretation of Applicant\u2019s current financial situation.\nHowever, even if the Judge erred, we conclude that the error is also harmless.\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, both as to the mitigating conditions and\nthe whole-person factors.
