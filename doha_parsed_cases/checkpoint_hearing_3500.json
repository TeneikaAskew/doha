The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on \nFebruary 6, 2023, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on February 23, 2023. \nThe Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 6, which were admitted into evidence \nwithout objection.

DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 7, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations, with explanations. His admissions are \nadopted as findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the \nadditional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 46 years old. He has worked for his current employer, a defense \ncontractor, since November 2006, as an x-ray technician. He has an associate degree. \nHe is divorced and he has eight children. (Tr. 6, 19-20; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file his 2000-2002 and his 2005-2019 \nfederal income tax returns as required (SOR \u00b6 1.a). It further alleged that he failed to file \nhis 2000-2002 and his 2005-2019 state income tax returns as required (SOR \u00b6 1.b). \nApplicant admitted these allegations in his security clearance application, his \nbackground investigation, his response to interrogatories, his SOR answer, and during \nhis hearing testimony. Applicant admitted that he has not filed any of these past federal \nand state tax returns. He admitted he just did not put forth the effort to file his tax \nreturns. He explained that when he paid for a tax preparation service to file his returns \nin the late 1990s and he did not receive a refund, he could not see the point in \ncontinuing to file his returns if he was not going to receive a refund---so he did not file. \nHe only filed his 2003 and 2004 tax returns because he needed to do so in order to \nenroll in college. He also admitted he did not file his federal tax returns out of spite \ntoward the IRS. He claims to have recently contacted another tax preparation service to \nhelp him file his past tax returns, but he provided no further information about this \narrangement. His tax-filing issues remain unresolved. (Tr. 23-27, 40-42; GE 1-3) \nThe SOR also alleged Applicant owed two delinquent accounts totaling \napproximately $4,000. (\u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.d) Applicant admitted owing these debts in his SOR \nanswer. In his hearing testimony, he indicated that he had either settled or paid both \ndebts. His most recent credit report in February 2023, supports his assertions because \nneither debt is listed therein. These debts are resolved. (Tr. 33-35; GE 5, SOR answer) \nApplicant\u2019s annual salary is approximately $81,000. He has approximately \n$7,000 in his checking accounts. (Tr. 38, 42) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concerns for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially applies: \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nThe record evidence supports that Applicant failed to timely file his 2000-2002 \nand his 2005-2019 federal and state income tax returns as he was required to do. The \nevidence also supports that he incurred two delinquent debts. I find the above \ndisqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant has failed to take any meaningful action to address his delinquent tax-\nfiling issues regarding his federal and state income tax returns for the years alleged. \nNeither of the above listed mitigating conditions apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. Applicant \nstated he paid the two delinquent debts. His assertions are corroborated by his \nFebruary 2023 credit report, which shows an absence of those two debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) \napplies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s federal contractor employment. However, his non-filing \nof his federal and state tax returns over a multi-year period causes me to question his \ntrustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment, especially because he cited as his \nreasons for not filing that it was not important enough for him to do so, and that he did \nnot file out of spite toward the IRS. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a - 1.b  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs: 1.c - 1.d   \nFor Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admits to all allegations in the SOR with some explanations. Applicant is a 36-year-old employee of a DOD contractor who seeks a security clearance. He has held a security clearance since 2009. He has been employed with his current employer since January 2021. He was employed by other defense contractors prior to this position. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in the spring 2022. He married in 2011, but separated from his wife in 2013. They have a ten-year-old son who lives with his wife. He has lived with a cohabitant since 2018. From 2009 to 2014, he served on active duty in the United States Army. He was separated for medical reasons due to a shoulder injury.

(SOR \u00b6 1.a: Gov 1 at 1; Gov 2 at 42) In his response to the SOR, he admits to using marijuana on a couple occasions. In response to Section 23, Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity, on his January 21, 2020 security clearance application, he listed using marijuana between March 2018 and August 2018, on 10 occasions.

Based \nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admits to all allegations in the SOR with \nsome explanations. \nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a DOD contractor who seeks a security \nclearance. He has held a security clearance since 2009. He has been employed with his \ncurrent employer since January 2021. He was employed by other defense contractors \nprior to this position. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in the spring 2022. He married in \n2011, but separated from his wife in 2013. They have a ten-year-old son who lives with \nhis wife. He has lived with a cohabitant since 2018. From 2009 to 2014, he served on \nactive duty in the United States Army. He was separated for medical reasons due to a \nshoulder injury. (Gov 2, Gov 3, Tr. 19-26) (Note: The facts in this decision do not \nspecifically describe employment, names of witnesses, or locations in order to protect \nApplicant\u2019s and his family\u2019s privacy. The cited sources contain more specific \ninformation.) \nDrug Involvement \nUnder the drug involvement concern, the SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana \nfrom March 2018 to August 2018. (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Gov 1 at 1; Gov 2 at 42) In his response \nto the SOR, he admits to using marijuana on a couple occasions. In response to Section \n23, Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity, on his January 21, 2020 security clearance \napplication, he listed using marijuana between March 2018 and August 2018, on 10 \noccasions. He indicated he used marijuana for relaxation and pain. During the hearing, \nhe testified that he used marijuana to help with pain in his shoulder. He injured his left \nshoulder while in the Army. He was ultimately medically boarded and discharged from \nthe U.S. Army as a result of this injury. \nHe stopped using marijuana when the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) prescribed him a long-term pain medication that \nwas effective in controlling his pain. (Tr. 26-27; Gov 2 at 27) \nApplicant states he never used marijuana before this time and has not used \nmarijuana since August 2018. He is aware that use of illegal drugs is not consistent with \nholding a security clearance. He provided the results of numerous drug tests taken on \nMay 14, 2019; October 22, 2019; February 3, 2020; and September 30, 2021, which \nindicate he tested negative for marijuana and other illicit substances. He tested positive \nfor his prescribed pain medication. He also provided a statement of intent to refrain from \nillegal drug use acknowledging any future use of illegal drugs would be grounds for \nrevoking his security clearance.

Use of a drug or controlled substance \nincludes injecting, snorting, inhaling, swallowing, experimenting with or otherwise \nconsuming any drug or controlled substance.\u201d Applicant failed to list his marijuana use \nbetween March 2018 and August 2018. (Tr. 28; Gov 3 at 41) \nApplicant admits he failed to list his marijuana use on his 2019 security clearance \napplication, but it was not intentional. He said it did not cross his mind. He completed \nthe 2019 security clearance in a hurry. He testified 2019 was not a great year for him \nand he had a lot of other stuff on his mind. He honestly does not know why he did not \nlist his 2018 marijuana use on the 2019 security clearance application. He did not intend \nto provide false or misleading information. (Tr. 28-30; Gov 1 at 1) About nine months \nlater, he was asked to submit a security clearance application for a top secret \nclearance. He completed another security clearance application on January 21, 2020. \nApplicant listed his marijuana use on this application in response to Section 23. (Tr. 29; \nGov 2 at 42) \nFinancial Considerations \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant has a history of financial irresponsibility. The \nSOR alleged 26 delinquent accounts, an approximate total balance of $71,891. Three of \nthe accounts were for student loans, totaling $25,697. The remaining 23 debts were \nconsumer/credit card accounts, totaling approximately $46,194. Applicant purchased a \nhouse in 2017. He started to purchase furniture and other items for his house and \nbecame financially over-extended. (Tr. 16-18, 32, 52) \nIn 2019, Applicant entered into an agreement with a debt company to help \nresolve his accounts. The debt company advised Applicant to stop paying towards his \ndebts. They wanted the debts to go delinquent. They would then negotiate settlement \nagreements for their clients. Applicant paid the debt company money twice a month. \nThe debt company was to use the money for negotiating settlements on the debts. \nApplicant did not realize that his debts would default if he did not make payments \ntoward the accounts. After several months, he did not think the debt company was \nmaking sufficient progress satisfying his debts. He quit doing business with the debt \ncompany in December 2019 and began to resolve the accounts on his own. Some of \nthe accounts were charged off and sent to collection. He said it was his mistake to enter \ninto an agreement with the debt company. He is now slowly working to resolve his \ndelinquent debts. He claims that he is not living outside his means. He was able to pay \nall of his accounts before he entered into an agreement with the debt company. Over \nthe past year, he has been able to raise his credit score almost 100 points as a result of \nworking to get his debts in good standing.

The counseling service was able to locate the \ncurrent creditors of the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.g, 1.h and 1.z.  These debts \nwere added to Applicant\u2019s payment plan which is to last for a period of 40 months. \nApplicant agreed to pay a first payment of $1,142 a month on January 15, 2023, and \nsubsequent payments of $1,117 due on the 15th  of each month. He intends to make \npayments by monthly allotment from his checking account. (AE B at 1-11) It appears \nthat all of Applicant\u2019s unresolved debts were included in the counseling service payment \nplan.  \nThe status of the debts alleged in the SOR are as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 3.a: $7,047 delinquent student loan account placed for collection. \nApplicant claims this account was a mistake on his credit report. He disputed it online \nand it was removed from his credit report. During the hearing, he said he would look for \nthe documentation that he disputed this debt. (Tr. 13-14, 30-31; Gov 1 at 3) \nSOR \u00b6 3.b: $2,721 charged-off credit card account. During the hearing, Applicant \ntestified he was unable to find the current owner of the account and said he would pay \nthe account if he locates them. After the hearing, the counseling service was able to \nlocate the current creditor and the debt was added to the new payment agreement \nApplicant has with the counseling service. (Tr. 14, 32-34; Gov 1 at 3; AE B at 2, 11) \nSOR \u00b6 3.c: $4,107 charged-off credit card account.

He hopes \nto have the account paid off in March 2023. (Tr. 14, 36-40; Gov 1 at 3, 24-26) This \naccount is likely included in the new payment agreement Applicant has with the \ncounseling service.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nDOD and Federal Government Policy on Marijuana Use \nOn October 25, 2014, the Director for National Intelligence, issued a \nmemorandum titled, \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use\u201d addressing \nconcerns raised by the decriminalization of marijuana use in several states and the \nDistrict of Columbia. The memorandum states that changes to state and local laws do \nnot alter the existing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines. \u201cAn individual\u2019s \ndisregard for federal law pertaining the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations.\u201d \nOn May 26, 2015, the Director of the United States Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) issued a memorandum titled, \u201cFederal Laws and Policies \nProhibiting Marijuana Use.\u201d The Director of OPM acknowledged that several \njurisdictions have decriminalized the use of marijuana, allowing the use of marijuana for \nmedicinal purposes and/or for limited recreational use but states that Federal law on \nmarijuana remains unchanged. Marijuana is categorized as a controlled substance \nunder Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. Thus knowing or intentional \nmarijuana possession is illegal, even if the individual has no intent to manufacture, \ndistribute, or dispense marijuana. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \nAG & 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of  \nprescription drug and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other \nsubstances that cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a \nmanner inconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find the following drug involvement disqualifying conditions apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case. \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse; and \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia.  \nThe SOR alleges and Applicant admits he used marijuana on at least 10 \noccasions between March 2018 and August 2018. There is sufficient evidence to \nconclude that Applicant used and possessed marijuana during this six-month period. \nAG \u00b6 25(a) and AG \u00b6 25(c) apply. \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement. The burden shifted to Applicant \nto produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. \n(Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and \nthe burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. September 22, 2005))  \nGuideline H also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from drug involvement. The following mitigating conditions potentially \napply to the Applicant\u2019s case: \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) applies because four years have passed since Applicant\u2019s last \ninvolvement with marijuana. While Applicant\u2019s illegal use of marijuana raises questions \nabout his judgment, he stopped using marijuana in August 2018. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) applies because Applicant acknowledged his illegal drug use and \nsigned a statement of intent indicating he will not use marijuana in the future. He \nacknowledged any future illegal use could result in the revocation of his security \nclearance. \nOverall, Applicant met his burden to mitigate the security concerns raised under \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b615: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during the national \nsecurity or adjudicative processes.  \nThe following disqualifying conditions potentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case: \nAG \u00b6 16(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national \nsecurity eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities  \nApplicant omitted his 2018 marijuana use on his April 2019 security clearance \napplication. He claims that his past marijuana use did not cross his mind and that he \nrushed when he completed the first security application. On his January 2020 security \nclearance application, Applicant listed using marijuana on ten occasions between March \n2018 and August 2018. I find his assertion that he forgot about this marijuana use when \ncompleting his earlier security clearance application lacks credibility.

This occurred nine months after he \ncompleted his April 2019 application, so his disclosure cannot be considered \u201cprompt.\u201d \nHowever, he revealed his marijuana use before being confronted about it. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) applies because Applicant acknowledged he omitted his illegal \nmarijuana use on his April 2019 security application. I took into consideration that \nApplicant he used marijuana to alleviate his shoulder pain, but do not consider it an \nexcuse for illegal drug use. However, Applicant has not used marijuana in over four \nyears. He signed a statement of intent to refrain from illegal marijuana use in the future \nacknowledging any future use would result in the revocation of his security clearance. It \nis unlikely that Applicant will repeat this conduct in the future. \nAG \u00b6 17(e) applies because Applicant fully disclosed his marijuana use. As a \nresult, he reduced his vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nPersonal Conduct Security Concerns are mitigated. \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations  \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns. \nThe disqualifying conditions that are relevant to Applicant\u2019s case include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a long history of financial problems. He incurred 26 delinquent \ndebts with an approximate total balance of over $71,000. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply \nto Applicant\u2019s case. \nAn individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or careless in his obligations to protect classified information. Behaving \nirresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in \nother aspects of life. A person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until \nevidence is uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to pay debts under \nagreed terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations. \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \n\u00b6E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nAG \u00b6 20 includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. \nApplicant is working on resolving these delinquent accounts. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies because Applicant\u2019s financial situation was adversely\naffected by his separation from his wife and likely pending divorce.  These \ncircumstances were beyond Applicant\u2019s control and adversely affected his ability to pay \nhis bills. However, this mitigating condition is given less weight because Applicant has \nnot demonstrated he acted responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant over-\nextended himself after purchasing a new house in 2017. For this reason, AG \u00b6 20(b) is \ngiven less weight.      \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) applies. Applicant initially entered into an agreement with a debt \ncompany who failed to make progress resolving the debts to Applicant\u2019s satisfaction. He \nterminated that agreement and resolved some of the debts on his own. In December \n2022, he entered into a counseling agreement with CCCS, a legitimate credit \ncounseling service. Not all of Applicant\u2019s debts are resolved, but CCCS is assisting \nApplicant with resolving his remaining debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applies towards the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.d, 3.f, 3.m \u2013 3.q, and \n3.s \u2013 3.y.  Applicant provided proof that he resolved these accounts. He is attempting to \nresolve his remaining outstanding accounts. He first sought the assistance with a debt \ncompany that did not really help him.  In December 2022, he sought the assistance of \nCCCS. They counseled Applicant on his finances and budget and drew up a repayment \nagreement for Applicant to follow to resolve his remaining delinquent debts.  Applicant is \nmaking a good-faith effort towards resolving his delinquent debts. It will likely take a few \nyears, but Applicant met his burden of proof to mitigate the concerns under Guideline F.  \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n13 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n          \n    \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n I considered Applicant\u2019s performance evaluations and favorable character \nreferences. I also considered his active duty service in the United States Army.  \nI find Applicant mitigated the security concerns under Guideline H because it has \nbeen more than four years since he last used marijuana and he signed a statement of \nintent to no longer use marijuana in the future. \nWhile Applicant\u2019s failure to list his 2018 marijuana use on his April 2019 security \nclearance application raised a concern under Personal Conduct about his judgment and \ntrustworthiness, he provided full disclosure about his marijuana use on a January 2020 \nsecurity clearance application. While not essentially prompt, he disclosed his marijuana \nuse before being confronted about it. The security concerns under Personal Conduct \nare mitigated. \nAs the debts in the SOR show, Applicant is financially over-extended. He has \nworked on resolving his delinquent debts for several years now. He initially entered into \nan agreement with a debt company who Applicant felt was not helpful in resolving his \naccounts. He started to resolve the accounts on his own. In December 2022, he \nconsulted CCCS who helped him prepare a budget and repayment plan that includes \nhis remaining unresolved accounts. While it will take several years to resolve these \ndebts, Applicant demonstrated he is making a good-faith effort to resolve his debts. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions as well as the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. All security concerns are mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a - 3.z:  \nFor Applicant \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Transcript (Tr.) at 11, 22-25, 55, 105; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE A, F) \nApplicant served on active duty in the U.S. military from 1991 until he was \nhonorably discharged in 1999. He reported that he served in the Iraq War when he \ndeployed with his unit to Kuwait in 1992 as a deterrent to Iraq\u2019s aggressive behavior. \n(Tr. at 11-21, 106-108, 114-115; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1; AE A-C) \nApplicant deployed to Bosnia in 1994 as part of a NATO force. He reported that \nhe rendered first aid to his platoon leader who was shot by a sniper. In a separate \nincident, a mine exploded as his platoon sergeant attempted to disarm it, killing the \nplatoon sergeant. The mine wounded Applicant and knocked him unconscious.

Applicant stated that he was told that he was not eligible for a Purple Heart for his \ninjuries because they were inflicted in a peacekeeping operation. Finally, he reported \nthat he stepped on a mine, but it did not explode. His command sergeant major came to \nhim and wrapped him in protective explosive gear and heroically remained with him \nwhile EOD attempted to disarm the mine. The mine did not have a fuse, which is why it \ndid not detonate. (Tr. at 16-22, 108-110; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1; AE A-C) \nDuring his military service, Applicant received the NATO Medal, three Army \nCommendation Medals, four Army Achievement Medals, the Armed Forces\nExpeditionary Medal, the Armed Forces Service Medal, and other badges and ribbons.\nHe is rated as 100% disabled by the Department of Veterans Affairs for among other\nthings, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury. (Tr. at 76, 105-\n106, 109; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE B, C) \n \n \n \nApplicant worked for a defense contractor and then as a civilian employee of the \nArmy after his discharge. He transferred to a new location in 2008. He was counseled in \nMarch 2009 for \u201cinappropriate behavior of either making suggestive comments to other \nfemale employees or making them feel uncomfortable with his comments.\u201d (Tr. at 12, \n22; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 3; AE A) \nIn January 2010, Applicant received a notification of a proposed suspension for \n14 days for sexual harassment and causing a disturbance. In April 2010, Applicant \nreceived another notification of a proposed suspension for sexual harassment, \ninappropriate touching, and false statements. This notice was issued by a different \nsupervisor and superseded the January 2010 notice. (GE 3) The alleged conduct was: \na.

On or about 14 December 2009, without justification or invitation, you \nsat on Ms. [A\u2019s] lap in an attempt to \u201cget her excited.\u201d During this incident \nyou were asked to stop. \nc. After the 14 December 2009 incident, you discussed a recent \nvasectomy with Ms. [A], stating to her that you \u201conly have 10 more times \nto ejaculate\u201d to be able to have sex, and asking her, \u201cAre you going to help \nme?\u201d You were told after this incident that this behavior was not \nappreciated and asked to stop. (GE 3) \nIn late June 2010, Applicant and his command reached a settlement agreement \nfor the suspension in which Applicant \u201cagreed to accept a five day suspension (5 \nconsecutive calendar days) from his position, two of which days [were] duty/work days \nand the other three days of which [were] non-duty/work days.\u201d The command agreed to \nremove the suspension documents from Applicant\u2019s Official Personnel File (OPF) within \ntwo years if there were no further infractions, \u201cthereby purging the OPF of this evidence \nof an adverse personnel action.\u201d The suspension took place in August 2010. Applicant \ntransferred to a different job on the same installation in December 2011. (Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 3; AE L) \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor prepared a letter of counseling in about September 2013. \nThe letter is included in a later command investigation (see below). The letter is undated \nand not signed by the supervisor or Applicant. It reported that Applicant made \ninappropriate \u201c[c]omments and gestures (licking).\u201d (GE 3) While unsigned, the letter was \na factor in the investigation discussed below. \nApplicant provided a statement in July 2015 in which he admitted that he took a \ntest for another employee who was having difficulty passing the test. He used the \nemployee\u2019s common access card (CAC) and personal identification number (PIN) to \ntake the test. (GE 4) He wrote: \nI felt pressured to assist, but didn\u2019t have time to sit down with him to go \nthrough each module and provide mentorship. I informed him that I didn\u2019t \nhave time to help until after all my current field tests have been completed. \n[Employee] then stated he was running out of time in order to meet the \ncourse deadline. I told him to request an extension, and I would then be \nable to assist in a mentor role maybe by mid-September 2015. [Employee] \nstated that he already was on an extension and need[ed] this completed \nASAP. I told [Employee] that I could only do that on the weekend on my \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nown time, but I prefer to wait until after my field tests were completed. \n[Employee] again explained he couldn\u2019t wait, so I felt pressured into just \n\u201cdoing\u201d it myself on the weekend. (GE 4) \nApplicant provided a different version at his hearing. He stated that his supervisor \ntold him to help the other employee pass the test. He admitted that he helped the other \nemployee while the employee took the test, but he did not take the test for him. He \nstated that he did not remember the 2015 statement, and he believes the statement \nmay have been altered. (Tr. at 72-75, 103-105, 111-113; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR) I \ndid not find his testimony on this and other matters credible. I find that the statement is \nthe more accurate description of what occurred, and that Applicant used another \nemployee\u2019s CAC and PIN to take a test for him. \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nMarch 2017. Under Section 13A \u2013 Employment Activities, he reported the job that \nended in December 2011. He answered \u201cNo\u201d to the following question, \u201cFor this \nemployment, in the last seven (7) years have you received a written warning, been \nofficially reprimanded, suspended, or disciplined for misconduct in the workplace, such \nas a violation of security policy?\u201d He failed to report the five-day suspension in late June \nor July 2010. (GE 1) \nApplicant denied intentionally providing false information on the SF 86. He \nexplained that he did not believe he had to report the suspension because in \naccordance with the settlement agreement, it had been officially removed from his OPF. \nHe stated that he asked the chief of security on his installation how he should answer \nthe question, and he was told to not report the suspension. (Tr. at 38-42, 76-77; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR) \nIn December 2018, a Commander\u2019s Inquiry was ordered into allegations of \nmisconduct by Applicant. A supplemental order was issued in January 2019. The report \nof the investigation was issued in February 2019. The commander and the \ncommander\u2019s attorney-advisor reviewed the investigation and found the investigation \nlegally sufficient, the findings and recommendations supported by sufficient evidence, \nand the recommendations consistent with the findings. The commander summarized \nparts of the investigation: \nThe investigating officer, Dr. [A], interviewed a total of 12 women about \nunwanted attention. Three of the women confirmed stating that [Applicant] \nhad given unwanted attention to them. The attention ranges from \ncomments about his sex life to asking them personal questions about their \nsex life, and even soliciting sex. Six of the women did not encounter any \nunwanted attention from [Applicant]. Two told Dr. [A] that they \nencountered inappropriate comments from [Applicant] but did not find \nthem offensive, and one said that if there was any inappropriate \ncomments by [Applicant], \u201cshe would tell [Applicant] that he was going too \nfar\u201d and he would stop. Dr. [A] found that [Applicant\u2019s] behavior violated \nAR 690-12, Appendix D, prohibiting all forms of harassments, including \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsexual harassment. Dr. [A] also found that [Applicant\u2019s] conduct was \npervasive enough as to create a hostile work environment. \nRegarding the allegation about potential threats in the workplace, Dr. [A] \nfound that [Applicant] had told numerous employees that he has PTSD. \nMr. [B] a co-worker, also told Dr. [A] that [Applicant] had talked to him \nopenly about active shooter on numerous occasions. . . . Although \n[Applicant] denies ever telling anyone that he has PTSD, Dr. [A] found his \ndenial not credible. Dr. [A\u2019s] finding is supported by statements he has \nfrom witnesses he interviewed. \nDr. [A] also investigated allegations by [Applicant] against Mr. [B]. The \nallegations are that Mr. [B] stabbed, threatened to beat up, intimidated \n[Applicant]; and shoved a Mr. [C] during a verbal altercation. Dr. [A] found \nthat the alleged stabbing was an accident which at the time [Applicant] \nrefused to seek medical attention or to file a police report. Dr. [A] also \ninterviewed Mr. [C] who admitted that Mr. [B] pushed him out of his space \nwhen he approached Mr. [B]. This was confirmed by another witness. Both \nparties reported the incident to their supervisors who felt that no further \naction was required. As to the alleged verbal intimidation, Dr. [A] found no \nevidence that the alleged statement was made at [Applicant]. [Applicant] \nconceded that he did not know who the statement was directed at. (GE 3) \nExcept for some minor admissions, Applicant has consistently denied committing \nany of the alleged workplace misconduct that led to his 2010 suspension and as \nreflected in the 2018 Commander\u2019s Inquiry. He stated that he believes multiple \nindividuals lied, and that they were either biased against him, coerced into lying, or \noffered some compensation such as a promotion for lying. He also felt that some other \nemployees\u2019 misconduct against him was \u201cswept under the rug.\u201d He submitted \ndocuments and letters in support of his position. (Tr. at 27-38, 42-72, 75-103, 117-118; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2; AE H-K, M, N, P) I considered Applicant\u2019s \ndocuments and his testimony, but I did not find his testimony credible. I adopt the \ninformation in the April 2010 notification of a proposed suspension and the findings in \nthe Commander\u2019s Inquiry, as reviewed by the commander and the commander\u2019s \nattorney-advisor. \nApplicant resigned from his position and received a deferred retirement in March \n2019. He was barred from entering the installation the same day based on allegations of \nunwanted sexual attention. (Tr. at 53-55; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 5; AE A, \nO) \nApplicant stated that he has learned from the experience, and that \u201chorseplay \nand banter and joking [are] not appropriate in the work environment.\u201d He also pledged \nto be more diligent when completing security clearance applications.

(GE 2; AE D, E, G, H) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process.

According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during the national \nsecurity investigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of:  \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other\nemployer\u2019s time or resources; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges the March 2009 counseling letter and the inappropriate \nconduct referenced in the letter. That conduct reflects questionable judgment and an \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and it created vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d) and 16(e) are applicable. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges the January 2010 notification of a proposed suspension. The \nnotice was superseded by a later notice alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. SOR \u00b6 1.b does not \nallege any conduct that is not also alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. When the same conduct is \nalleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations \nshould be resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. \nSep. 21, 2005). SOR \u00b6 1.b is concluded for Applicant. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges the April 2010 notification of a proposed suspension and the \ninappropriate conduct referenced in the notice. That conduct reflects questionable \njudgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and it created \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d) and 16(e) are \napplicable. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges the June 2010 settlement agreement. SOR \u00b6 1.d does not \nallege any conduct that is not also alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. SOR \u00b6 1.d is concluded for \nApplicant. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges that in February 2019, Applicant was \u201cfound culpable by a \nCommander\u2019s Inquiry for giving three female employees unwanted attention with \nsexually-themed comments.\u201d That conduct reflects questionable judgment and an \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and it created vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d) and 16(e) are applicable. \nThe SOR did not allege the other conduct discussed in the Commander\u2019s Inquiry, \nand that conduct will not be used for disqualification purposes. Any matter that was not \nalleged in the SOR will not be used for disqualification purposes. It may be used to \nassess Applicant\u2019s credibility, in the application of mitigating conditions, and in the \nwhole-person analysis. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges that Applicant was barred from entering the installation \u201cfor \n[his] improper conduct toward female employees.\u201d SOR \u00b6 1.f does not allege any \nconduct that is not also alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. SOR \u00b6 1.f is concluded for Applicant. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges that Applicant\u2019s security clearance was suspended by the \nDirector of the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency. This allegation does \nnot allege conduct by Applicant. It alleges a result of his conduct. SOR \u00b6 1.g is \nconcluded for Applicant. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleges Applicant intentionally falsified Section 13A of his March 2017 \nSF 86 when he answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question that asked if in the last seven years he \nreceived a written warning, been officially reprimanded, suspended, or disciplined for \nmisconduct in the workplace, such as a violation of security policy. He failed to report \nthe five-day suspension in late June or July 2010. \nApplicant denied intentionally providing false information on the SF 86. He \nexplained that he did not believe he had to report the suspension because in \naccordance with the settlement agreement, it had been officially removed from his OPF. \nHe stated that he asked the chief of security on his installation how he should answer \nthe question, and he was told to not report the suspension. While I do not believe much \nof Applicant\u2019s testimony, I believe this conversation took place. I am not convinced by \nsubstantial evidence that he intentionally falsified this question. AG \u00b6 16(b) is not \napplicable. This allegation is not established, and it is concluded for Applicant. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nI accept that Applicant committed the misconduct identified in the April 2010 \nnotification of a proposed suspension and in the Commander\u2019s Inquiry. I am also \nconvinced that he used another employee\u2019s CAC and PIN to take a test for him. Finally, \nhe has been dishonest for years, including at his hearing. Applicant\u2019s conduct casts \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Personal conduct \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated under any of the mitigating conditions. \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology  \nThe security concern for use of information technology is set out in AG \u00b6 39: \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \nand information. Information Technology includes any computer-based, \nmobile, or wireless device used to create, store, access, process, \nmanipulate, protect, or move information. This includes any component, \nwhether integrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, \nsoftware, or firmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations. \nAG \u00b6 40 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) unauthorized entry into any information technology system; and \n(e) unauthorized use of any information technology system.  \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant used another employee\u2019s CAC and PIN to \ncomplete a course for the employee. Applicant admitted that he helped the other \nemployee while the employee took the test, but he did not take the test for him. His \n2015 statement contradicts that testimony. I did not find his testimony credible. I find \nthat the 2015 statement is the more accurate description of what occurred, and that \nApplicant used another employee\u2019s CAC and PIN to take a test for him. AG \u00b6\u00b6 41(a) \nand 41(e) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the use of information technology systems security \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 41. The following are potentially applicable: \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment;  \n(b) the misuse was minor and done solely in the interest of organizational \nefficiency and effectiveness; \n(c) the conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a \nprompt, good\u00adfaith effort to correct the situation and by notification to \nappropriate personnel; and \n(d) the misuse was due to improper or inadequate training or unclear \ninstructions. \nThe incident happened in 2015, almost eight years ago. If Applicant had been \nhonest and accepted responsibility for the conduct, it would have been mitigated. \nHowever, he did neither. His conduct continues to cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. None of the mitigating conditions are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E and M in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s honorable military service and favorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the personal conduct and use of information technology security concerns. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.h: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline M: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

He was convicted of the lesser \noffense and sentenced to 12 months in jail. He served eight months and was released \nearly. (Tr. 24, 39-45) \nAfter Applicant\u2019s release from jail, he would purchase small amounts of marijuana \nfrom friends for personal use, and he used marijuana with varying frequency from 1994 \nto 2001. He stopped using marijuana when he applied for a job in 2001 that required a \nsecurity clearance. He said he did not receive the clearance. He testified he also stopped \nusing marijuana because he wanted to pursue a different path for his life. He became \ninvolved with his church and turned his life to God. In approximately 2006, he applied for \nanother job that required a security clearance. He was denied the clearance after going \nthrough the adjudicative process, including a hearing with an administrative judge from \nDOHA. In 2009, Applicant reapplied for a security clearance and it was granted in 2010. \nAll of his jobs since 2010 have required a security clearance. (Tr. 23-26, 45-52) \nIn about 2011, Applicant and his wife purchased undeveloped property in the \ncountry on which they spent years clearing brush and trees, erecting fences and \nrenovating buildings. Six years later, after his stepson graduated from high school, he \nand his wife moved to their tiny house, planted gardens, fruit trees, berry orchards, and \nlearned to care for livestock. Applicant was also in a position to invest more time into his \nhobby of cycling that he pursues three to four times a week for two to three hours at a \ntime. Applicant also continued to work hard at his job. In 2019, after years of working \nevery day and every weekend, he and his wife planned a vacation. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nApplicant and his wife planned their vacation for months. They intended to fly to \nColorado and rent a recreational vehicle and then drive to various locations where they \ncould hike and bike and enjoy the mountains. They purchased one-way tickets, as when \nthey completed their mountain trip, they intended to drive home. In order to leave their \nfarm, they required someone who was experienced in caring for animals. Their farm is \nnot for profit, but intended for a degree of self-sufficiency. They arranged for a person to \ncare for the farm animals while they were gone. He was to come to the farm the day \nbefore they were to leave for vacation so they could do a last-minute walk through. The \nfarm hand failed to show up the day before and could not be contacted. He had gotten \nthe days wrong. (Tr. 26-30; Answer to the SOR) \nThe plane tickets were non-refundable, so Applicant\u2019s wife suggested that \nApplicant take the trip without her, rent a bike, and cycle through the Rockies. Applicant \nalready had approved leave. He did not want to go on vacation without his wife, but at her \ninsistence and to give him a much-needed vacation, he took the trip. (Tr. 26-30; Answer \nto the SOR) \nApplicant arrived in Colorado and checked out bike shops. There were numerous \ncannabis shops. Use and possession of marijuana is legal in Colorado. He testified that \nhe was curious because there were cannabis stores everywhere and since it was legal in \nthe state, he went into one and on impulse purchased a small amount of marijuana. He \nwent back to his hotel room and used a small amount. About ten minutes later, he realized \nhis mistake and did not like the way the drug made him feel. He disposed of the marijuana, \ncalled his wife, told her what he did, and said he wanted to come home immediately. He \ndid not want to vacation without his wife and felt guilty for his actions. He checked out of \nthe hotel at 4:00 a.m. the next morning and drove home. (Tr. 30-33, 52-53, 55; Answer to \nthe SOR) \nApplicant credibly testified that this one-time use in 2019 was the only time since \n2001 that he used marijuana or any illegal drug. His wife and his stepson are aware of \nhis use. In July 2020, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) as part \nof his reinvestigation for his security clearance. In the SCA, he disclosed his one-time use \nof marijuana in October 2019, while he held a security clearance. He indicated his intent \nnever to use it again because it jeopardized all that he had worked for. Applicant provided \na signed statement swearing that he does not intend to use marijuana again and \nunderstands revocation of his security clearance would be immediate if he did. Applicant \ncredibly testified that he never considered lying on his SCA and not disclosing his \nmarijuana use. He felt it was his duty and obligation to disclose the information. (Tr. 23, \n34-36, 53, 58-59; GE 1; AE I) \nIn September 2020 Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. He \ndisclosed his purchase of marijuana in Colorado while on vacation and his one-time use \nbefore discarding the remaining marijuana. He told the investigator that he regretted his \nactions and the risk was not worth jeopardizing his livelihood. He made a full disclosure \nto the investigator.

(Tr. 35-37, 56-57-58) \nApplicant\u2019s wife testified on his behalf. She confirmed that she and Applicant had \nworked tirelessly on their farm, and they were looking forward to a second honeymoon \nbecause they were unable to take a first one. When their farm hand failed to show up, \nshe had insisted Applicant go on the trip without her because he deserved a break.

She wanted him to put the incident behind him and enjoy the rest of the vacation, \nbut he wanted to come home. She testified he was angry with himself and remorseful. \nShe stated that he has a set of ethics that he lives by, and he is brutally honest. He is \ndevoted to his faith and it is an integral and cornerstone part of his life. She believes she \nknows him better than anyone and acknowledges his past and that he has evolved. (Tr. \n64-76) \nApplicant\u2019s former supervisor testified on his behalf. She has known him since \n2003 and supervised him for four to five years. He does excellent work and is honest to \na fault. She is aware of his marijuana use in 2019. She was somewhat aware that he had \nissues in his background, but he had overcome them. She considers him trustworthy. She \nacknowledged he used bad judgment when he used marijuana, but he was honest when \nhe disclosed it. She has no concerns about him holding a security clearance. (Tr. 76-83) \nA coworker, who is retired from the military and has worked with Applicant since \n2009, testified on his behalf. He noted that Applicant\u2019s work was detailed and excellent. \nHe stated that Applicant is very honest, and he has integrity. He is aware of Applicant\u2019s \n2019 marijuana use and he did not have concerns with him having a security clearance. \n(Tr. 84-89) \nApplicant provided a copy of an award, letters of appreciation, certificates of \nexcellence, letters of outstanding performance in support of a military program, certificate \nof excellence for exceptional service to the military, and a chronological list of \naccomplishments since August 2018. (AE A-H) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse;  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacturing, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and  \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position.  \nApplicant purchased and used marijuana with varying frequency from 1994 to \n2001. In 1994, he was arrested and charged with felony trafficking cannabis. He was \nconvicted of the lesser included offense of possession of marijuana. In October 2019, \nApplicant purchased and used marijuana. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) apply to these facts. \nApplicant held a security clearance at the time he used marijuana in October 2019, \nbut there is no evidence that he had access to classified information at the time. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information and the granting of access to classified information \nare not synonymous concepts. They are separate determinations. The issuance of a \nsecurity clearance is a determination that an individual is eligible for access to classified \nnational security information up to a certain level. Security clearance eligibility alone does \nnot grant an individual access to classified materials. In order to gain access to specific \nclassified materials, an individual must not only have eligibility (i.e., a security clearance), \nbut also must have signed a nondisclosure agreement and have a \u201cneed to know.\u201d See \nISCR Case No. 20-03111 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2022). I find that AG \u00b6 25(f) does not \napply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The \nfollowing mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing\na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and\nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is\ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n \n \n \nThe evidence supports that Applicant regularly used marijuana from 1994 to 2001. \nAfter his conviction for possession of marijuana in 1994, he continued to use marijuana. \nIn 2001, he was denied a security clearance. At this point, he decided to change his life, \nand did. He married and found his faith. He and his wife work hard on their family farm. \nApplicant and his wife intended to take a vacation together and despite their best efforts \nof planning, the farm hand failed to show up. Applicant did not want to go alone, but at \nthe insistence of his wife, he went to Colorado. While there he used marijuana one time. \nBefore 2001, Applicant had an extensive drug history. He readily acknowledged \nhis transgressions. I found Applicant\u2019s testimony to be candid and remorseful. I do not \nhave any concerns about Applicant using illegal drugs in the future. I believe his use in \nOctober 2019 was under unique circumstances, and is unlikely to recur, but it does not \nnegate poor judgment in knowingly using marijuana. \nApplicant was previously denied a security clearance, and had gone through the \nadjudication process, so he was aware and on notice of the ramifications drug use would \nhave on his security clearance. He has acknowledged his transgressions and except for \nthis one-time occurrence in 2019, he has been abstinent. He signed a letter of intent not \nto use illegal drugs in the future. I find both mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concerns for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standards; . . . . \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR allegations under the drug involvement guideline were cross-alleged \nunder the personal conduct guideline. Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency \nfrom 1994 to 2001. In 1994, he was convicted of possession of marijuana. In October \n2019, he used marijuana. The above disqualifying condition applies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom personal conduct. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n17: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or otherwise inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is \nunlikely to recur. \nThe same analysis under the drug involvement guideline applies under the \npersonal conduct guideline. In addition, I conclude the offense was not minor because \nApplicant was aware of the prohibition of illegal drug use while working for a federal \nemployer. However, it happened under unique circumstances, and I do not believe \nApplicant will use illegal drugs in the future. Applicant acknowledged his behavior and \ndisclosed it on his SCA. Although he was required to disclose any illegal drug use, it is \nunlikely his October 2019 use would have otherwise been detected if he had not been \nhonest. The above mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nI do not believe Applicant will use illegal drugs in the future. The question is \nwhether his most recent drug use in 2019 raises questions about his judgment, reliability \nand trustworthiness. Applicant clearly exercised poor judgment when he decided to use \nmarijuana in 2019 while holding a security clearance, but not access to classified \ninformation. After 2001, he changed his life, married, found his faith, and he and his wife \ndevoted their time to their farm. Applicant was obligated to disclose his 2019 marijuana \nuse on his SCA. I have given considerable weight to the fact that although he was required \nto disclose this information, no one would have been aware of this use had he not been \nhonest about it. The security clearance process is not meant to punish, but is to make a \ndetermination about whether there are legitimate security concerns about applicants. \nAlthough, Applicant has had issues in the past and succumbed to temptation in 2019, \nwhich is aggravated because he held a security clearance at the time, I do not believe \nthis one time occurrence rises to the level of a current security concern. I have considered \nthat he was given a second chance when he was granted a security clearance in 2010. I \nobserved him and believe he is overwhelmed with guilt for his conduct and is remorseful. \nHe was candid when he testified, and I found him credible. After considering the whole-\nperson, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline H, drug involvement \nand substance misuse, and Guideline E, personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCarol G.

The DCSA CAS acted under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense (DOD) 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines effective June 8, 2017 (AG). \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 2, 2022, and elected to have her case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s File of Relevant Material on August 24, 2022. The evidence included in \nthe FORM is identified as Items 2-6 (Item 1 includes pleadings and transmittal \ninformation). The FORM was received by Applicant on September 13, 2022. Applicant \nwas given an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. She did not file objections to the Government\u2019s evidence, or \nsubmit any exhibits. Items 2-6 are admitted into evidence. The case was assigned to \nme on July 24, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations in her answer to the SOR. Her \nadmissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review of the pleadings and \nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 40 years old. She has worked for her current government-contractor-\nemployer since 2020. She has a full employment history dating back to 2007. She holds \na bachelor\u2019s degree. She has never married and has no children. (Item 2) \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged Applicant failed to file her 2015-2019 federal \nincome tax returns, and accrued 18 delinquent debts totaling approximately $76,000. \nThe debts are comprised of collections and charged-off accounts (student loans, credit \ncard, and consumer debt). Some of the delinquency dates relate back to 2009. The \nunfiled tax returns are established by her security clearance application (SCA) \nadmissions and her SOR admissions. The debts are established by her admissions in \nher answer, security clearance application (SCA), and during her background interview, \nand credit reports from October 2020 and August 2022. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.s) (Items 2-3, 5-\n6) \nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleged that Applicant was arrested in February \n2016 for driving with a suspended license. It also alleged that she was arrested in July \n2010 and charged with one count of theft and one count of failure to appear. It also \nalleged that she was arrested in June 2003 and charged with one count of theft and was \nplaced on probation for 24 months. Her admissions in her SOR response, with no \nfurther explanations, support the allegations. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.c) (Item 1-Answer to SOR) \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant deliberately falsified material \nfacts in her September 2020 SCA when she failed to disclose her February 2016 arrest, \nas described in SOR \u00b6 2.a, in Section 22 of the SCA. It also alleged that Applicant \nfalsified material facts in her September 2020 SCA when she failed to list her July 2010 \narrest, as described in SOR \u00b6 2.b, in Section 22 of the SCA. However, that arrest was \nover seven years old, and did not need to be listed on her SCA. As to this part of the \nallegation, I find in favor of Applicant.

In her October 2020 background interview with an investigator, she \naffirmed not filing her federal income tax returns for those years. Her reason for not \nfiling was that she started having financial problems because of her spotty employment. \nIn order to continue paying her immediate bills, such as rent, she stopped filing her \nfederal income tax returns. She also stated that now that she had her current job, she \nwould contact an accountant by the end of the year (2020) and file her returns. In her \nSOR answer, after admitting not filing those tax returns, she stated that she was \n\u201cworking on having 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 filed by September 2022.\u201d She \nfailed to produce any evidence that those filings were made. (Items 1-3) \nAppellant listed some of the delinquent debts in her 2020 SCA, but not all. During \nher background interview, she admitted all her SOR debts when the investigator \nconfronted her with them, including her 14 delinquent student loans. Regarding her \nconsumer and credit-card debts, she asserted that now that she had a good job, she \nwould look at her credit reports, contact the creditors, and pay the bills. There is no \nevidence that she took any of those actions. She claimed she was unaware that her \nstudent loans were delinquent. She asserted she would contact her financial aid office \nand take care of these loans. There is no evidence that she took that action. She \nclaimed that her financial situation is a work in progress, but she was in a better state \nthan she had been in a long time. She did not produce any evidence of debt payment, \npayment plans reached, contact with any of the creditors, or any other actions she took \nto resolve these debts. (Items 1-3, 5-6) \nCriminal Conduct \nIn her SOR answer, Applicant admitted to the alleged three criminal arrests in \n2016, 2010, and 2003. She did not provide any explanation for the arrests in her SCA, \nher background interview, or her SOR answer. The source of the arrest information \ncomes from an FBI identification record, which lists the arrests. There is no evidence of \nany criminal arrests after 2016. (Items 1, 4) \nPersonal Conduct \nIn her SOR answer, Applicant admitted deliberately omitting her 2016 arrest on \nher 2020 SCA as she was required to list in response to Section 22. She failed to \nprovide any explanation for this omission during her background interview or her SOR \nanswer. (Items 1-2) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b618 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b619 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nThere is no evidence showing that Applicant filed her 2015-2019 federal income \ntax returns. All of her delinquent debts remain unpaid and unresolved. She has a history \nof unpaid debts. I find the above disqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant has a history of financial difficulties. She failed to take action to file her \ndelinquent federal income tax returns. The SOR debts are ongoing and therefore \nrecent. All of her debts are unresolved. She did not provide sufficient evidence to show \nthat her financial problems are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. While she \nclaimed low paying and sporadic employment as the cause of her financial distress, \nwhich is a condition beyond her control, she failed to present evidence that she acted \nresponsibly in an effort to resolve them. I find AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. No information \nwas provided that she sought financial counseling, has made a good-faith effort to \nresolve her delinquent debts, or has made arrangements to file her relevant tax returns. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), 20(d) and 20(g) do not apply. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for criminal conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted.  \nApplicant was arrested and charged for various criminal offenses in 2016, 2010, \nand 2003. The above disqualifying condition applies. \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for criminal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 32 and considered the following relevant: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. \nApplicant\u2019s last arrest occurred in 2016. There is no evidence in the record that \nany additional arrests have occurred since that time. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) applies. The criminal \nconduct security concerns are mitigated. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant\u2019s bare admission in her SOR answer to deliberately providing false \ninformation on her September 2020 SCA by failing to list her 2016 arrest satisfies this \ndisqualifying condition. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 17 and found the following relevant: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and   \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur.  \nApplicant failed to address any explanation for not listing her 2016 arrest on her \nSCA. Since an applicant has the burden to establish mitigating conditions, Applicant did \nnot meet that burden here. AG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply. \nDeliberately providing false information on an SCA is not a minor offense and it \noccurred as recently as 2020. Providing deliberate false information on her SCA casts \ndoubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. \nThere is insufficient evidence to indicate that such behavior is unlikely to recur. \nAG \u00b6 17(d) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not established a \ntrack record of financial stability, and deliberately provided false information on her 2020 \nSCA. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations, and Guideline E, personal conduct. She mitigated the criminal \nconduct concerns under Guideline J. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.s: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant [Except the \nlanguage in SOR \u00b6 3.a that refers \nto SOR \u00b6 2.b.] \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Since August 2020, he has worked for a government contractor as a software \nengineer. This is his first application for a DOD security clearance. (Item 3) \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant had used marijuana from 2010 \nto June 2020, and that he sold marijuana in 2014. It also alleged he used psilocybin \nmushrooms from 2014 to February 2020, and that he sold psilocybin mushrooms from \nJuly 2017 to May 2019 (on two or three occasions, and no more than six ounces on each \noccasion). (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.h, and 1.j.) It also alleges he used LSD (on three \noccasions) from 2016 to 2017, and he used cocaine (on two occasions) in November \n2016 and February 2019. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d.) The SOR also alleges that he used \nmedications not prescribed to him, such as Hydrocodone (once) in July 2015, and \nAdderall (about ten times) from December 2013 to November 2015. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f.) \nAlso alleged is that in April 2012, he was charged with possession of marijuana and \npossession of paraphernalia. (SOR \u00b6 1.g.) It is alleged that in August 2016, he was \ncharged with felony possession of a controlled substance, and that he was convicted of \nthree misdemeanors \u2013 possession of marijuana, possession of paraphernalia, and \ningestion of an intoxicant other than alcohol.

In his Answer, he \nlisted that he is remorseful for his past illegal drug use. He also believed a significant \namount of time had passed since he last used any illegal drug, which was marijuana in \nJune 2020. He explained that he is more mature and has consistently demonstrated good \njudgment in his career as a software engineer. He no longer associates with friends who \nuse illegal drugs. (Item 2) \nApplicant was in high school when he was charged in 2012 with possession of \nmarijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia. He was not convicted of these charges. \nHe abstained from using marijuana for about two years after this incident. In August 2016, \nApplicant, the driver of the car, and two other passengers were pulled over by the police \nfor speeding. All four occupants were arrested for possession of a controlled substance, \n(hashish brownies), a felony, less than two ounces of marijuana, ingestion of intoxicant, \nother than alcohol, and drug paraphernalia (bong and pipe with residue). Applicant was \n22 years-old at the time of this arrest. He pleaded guilty to three misdemeanor offenses. \n(Item 2 Exhibits D and E, Item 3, Item 4) \nIn May 2021, Applicant participated in a drug abuse evaluation and submitted \ndocumentation with his Answer. The record showed that he started smoking marijuana at \nage 16, and he progressed to daily use of marijuana from approximately age 17 to 18. \nAfter his 2016 offense, he smoked marijuana about two or three times a year until June \n2020. He used Adderall without a prescription on about ten occasions during college to \nhelp him study. He took psilocybin mushrooms five to ten times, and LSD three times. He \ningested unprescribed Hydrocodone one time. The counselor found Applicant to be very \ncredible and noted that he fit the criteria for cannabis use disorder, mild, in remission. \nApplicant is considered to be in a low-risk category. (Item 2 Exhibit E) \nApplicant was completely candid about his illegal drug use and drug-related arrests \non his August 2020 SCA. He understands marijuana use is against federal law, and it is \nunacceptable for individuals possessing DOD security clearances to smoke marijuana, \neven if the state law makes it legal to do so. He signed a letter of intent declaring that that \nhe had no intention of using any illegal drug in the future. (Item 2, Item 3) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.

AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances . . . can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 25 \nand the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of substance abuse disorder. \nApplicant used marijuana from about 2010 to June 2020, and other illegal \nsubstances from about 2014 to February 2020. He sold marijuana in 2014 and sold \npsilocybin (he cultivated in college) on two or three occasions. His May 2021 substance \nabuse evaluation showed that he was diagnosed with cannabis use disorder, mild, in \nremission. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26. The following are \npotentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed a statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nApplicant used marijuana and other illegal substances over a long period of time, \nfrom about 2010 to at least June 2020. He tapered off using marijuana after his arrest in \n2016 because he had matured, and he wanted to make positive changes in his life to be \nsuccessful in his career. He has not used marijuana in nearly three years. His May 2021 \nsubstance abuse evaluation showed his disorder was in remission and is in a low-risk \ncategory. Applicant provided a letter of intent to never use marijuana again. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was candid with his history of illegal drug use and his involvement with \nlaw enforcement when he completed the SCA in August 2020. I find he is sincere in his \ncommitment to remain drug-free, and he is unlikely to resume his use of marijuana or any \nother illegal substance. He stopped associating with friends who use illegal drugs, and he \nhas abstained from using marijuana for nearly three years. Mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n26(a) and 26(b)(1)(2) and (3) apply. Drug involvement and substance misuse security \nconcerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline H and the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. \nThe government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in \npersons granted access to classified information. In deciding whether to grant or continue \naccess to classified information, the government can take into account facts and \ncircumstances of an applicant's personal life that shed light on the person's judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. Furthermore, security clearance decisions are not limited \nto consideration of an applicant's conduct during work or duty hours. Even if an applicant \nhas a good work record, his off-duty conduct or circumstances can have security \nsignificance and may be considered in evaluating the applicant's national security \neligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s illegal use of marijuana and other controlled substances occurred \npredominantly during his high school and college years. He has matured and he is \nremorseful about his past involvement with illegal drugs. He was forthright about his drug-\nrelated offenses and provided full details about his illegal drug use history on his August \n2020 SCA. He has made positive changes in his life and is aware that future illegal drug \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \nuse may jeopardize his career. Given the entirety of the record evidence, I conclude that \nApplicant mitigated the drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.j.:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings \nand exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 38 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2010. He married his \nwife in 2012, and they have twins, age 10. Since September 2014, he has been \nemployed by a federal contractor as a quality assurance analyst. Applicant currently \npossesses a DOD security clearance. (Tr. 14-17; GE 1) \nIn his August 2020 SCA, Applicant disclosed that he used marijuana daily from \nJune 2019 to November 2019, while he possessed a DOD security clearance. He listed \nthat he did not intend to use marijuana in the future because it is unhealthy. He \npurchased marijuana on a monthly basis from June 2019 to November 2019. He also \nlisted that he was arrested in November 2019 for felonious possession of marijuana and \nfelonious distribution of marijuana. He was still awaiting trial for these charges at the \ntime he completed his SCA. (Tr. 18-21; GE 1) \nIn December 2020, Applicant participated in a background interview with an \nauthorized DOD investigator. Applicant provided details about his use of marijuana and \nstated that he would smoke about one or two puffs a day, approximately half of a gram \nof marijuana. He used marijuana to relieve his stress. He told the investigator that he \nwould purchase marijuana from \u201cpop up\u201d parties near his residence. These events were \nheld in a market setting where customers could purchase an item and then the \nindividual was \u201cgifted\u201d with free marijuana. Applicant estimated that he spent $200 a \nmonth for marijuana, and he had no intention of using marijuana again in the future. He \nresearched other ways to relieve stress, and he currently uses meditation and binaural \nbeats, that have significantly reduced his tension. (GE 2; Tr. 23-25, 41) \nDuring the hearing, Applicant admitted that, when he was stopped by police in \nNovember 2019, he had about one-and-a-half ounces of individually packaged \nmarijuana and several smoking devices in his backpack.

He admitted that he smoked marijuana more frequently on the weekends, and \nsometimes he added the concentrated THC to his marijuana. The police also found that \nApplicant possessed a large amount of cash in large denominations, approximately \n$900. Applicant stated that his parents taught him to always carry a large amount of \nmoney. He normally carries around $200 to $300 cash on him, but he had extra money \nin his possession because he had just won approximately $500 from a sports bet. He \ndenied that he was selling marijuana. He admitted that he was aware marijuana was \nillegal under federal and state law and violated the requirements for individuals \npossessing security clearances. He reported his arrest to his employer\u2019s security officer. \nHe attended Narcotics Anonymous for six months, participated in drug screenings, and \nhe completed over 180 hours of community service. The court dismissed the charges \nagainst him. (Tr. 26-37, 39-42; GE 3, GE 4, GE 5) \nApplicant testified that he stopped using marijuana in November 2019 only after \nhe had been arrested. He admitted that if he had not been arrested, he most likely \nwould have continued using marijuana. The arrest was a wake-up call. Although he \npossessed a DOD security clearance, he did not report his previous use and \npossession of marijuana to his security officer until after his arrest. (Tr. 36-37; GE 1) \nApplicant provided a character reference letter from his team manager, who \ndescribed Applicant as an effective leader of the team. He has no reservations about \nApplicant\u2019s character, responsibility, or patriotism. The team manager did not state in \nhis letter whether he was aware of Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use. Applicant also submitted \nan April 20, 2023, drug screen certificate which showed no drugs were detected in his \nurine. (AE A and AE B) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 an \u201capplicant is responsible \nfor presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant used marijuana daily from June 2019 to November 2019, while \npossessing a DOD security clearance, and he was arrested on drug-related charges in \nNovember 2019. The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(f). \nDNI Memorandum ES 2014-00674, \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting \nMarijuana Use,\u201d October 25, 2014, states: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining\nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative\nGuidelines . . . . An individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the\nuse, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in\nnational security determinations. As always, adjudicative authorities are\nexpected to evaluate claimed or developed use of, or involvement with,\nmarijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. The adjudicative authority\nmust determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana raises\nquestions about the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and\nwillingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, including federal\nlaws, when making eligibility decisions of persons proposed for, or\noccupying, sensitive national security positions. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from drug involvement and substance misuse. The following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, \nand has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were being \nused; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s last use of marijuana \noccurred in November 2019 while he possessed a DOD security clearance. He failed to \nabstain from marijuana involvement despite acknowledging doing so was in violation of \nstate and federal laws, and in contravention of the requirements for security clearance \nholders. He candidly admitted that if not for his 2019 arrest, he most likely would have \ncontinued to use marijuana. His marijuana use was daily, and he used marijuana more \nfrequently on the weekends. He reported his marijuana use to his employer\u2019s security \nofficer only after he had been arrested for drug-related misconduct. Overall, his use of \nillegal substances while possessing a security clearance continues to cast doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Applicant failed to mitigate the drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse security concerns. \nCriminal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 30 describes the security concern about criminal conduct: \u201cCriminal activity \ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very \nnature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant possessed and used marijuana (and a concentrated THC derivative) \non multiple occasions from June 2019 to November 2019. Each time he used and \npossessed marijuana he committed a federal and state criminal offense. He was \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \narrested in November 2019 on felonious drug-related charges. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b) \nare established. \nAG \u00b6 32 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant presented some evidence of rehabilitation and mitigation. He has an \nexcellent employment history while working for his employer for nearly nine years. The \nevidence against mitigation of criminal conduct security concerns is more persuasive. \nAs discussed previously, the criminal conduct security concerns are not mitigated for \nthe same reasons that the drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns \nare not mitigated. Applicant\u2019s frequent marijuana use, despite knowing such use \nviolated laws and security regulations, continues to cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. This arrest \noccurred three and one-half years ago. More time without criminal activity involving \nmarijuana must elapse before criminal conduct concerns will be fully mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines H and J in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana while holding a security clearance places a heavy \nburden on him to establish mitigation. It is well settled that once a concern arises \nregarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption \nagainst granting a security clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable \nclearance decision means that the record discloses no basis for doubt about an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case No. 12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nAfter considering the record as a whole, to include the circumstances \nsurrounding Applicant\u2019s use and purchase of marijuana, I conclude that Applicant has \nnot met his heavy burden of proof and persuasion due to the recency of his last use of \nmarijuana while holding a DOD security clearance. His decision to use marijuana \ndespite knowing he was violating laws and security regulations continues to cast doubt \non his reliability, trustworthiness, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. It was only after he was detected by law enforcement that he made the \ndecision to abstain from using illegal drugs and report his misconduct to his security \nofficer. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline H and Guideline J. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his answer, Applicant denied the SOR allegations. After review of the pleadings, testimony, and evidence submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 36 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2012. He was first granted a security clearance in 2010. His most recent SCA was submitted in June 2017. For over ten years, he has worked for government contractors in a national security related information technology field. He possesses specialized knowledge, skills, and experience in this field. (Tr. 19-21; GE 1, 2) The SOR alleges that Applicant was terminated or resigned in lieu of termination from the government contractor in 2015 for timecard fraud (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and from the bank in 2010 for falsification or fraud (SOR \u00b6 1.b). It also alleges that he deliberately falsified his 2017 SCA about why he left these two jobs and failed to disclose that he was terminated or resigned in lieu of termination. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d). Applicant stated that his first real job was as a personal banker with a national bank chain. Prior to this job, he worked part-time jobs while going to school. He reported that his job at the bank was to assist customers with their accounts, and to encourage them to open new accounts. He asserted that newly opened accounts were an important metric for management compensation. He stated that he was paid a flat salary and did not earn a bonus.

It also alleges that he deliberately falsified \nhis 2017 SCA about why he left these two jobs and failed to disclose that he was \nterminated or resigned in lieu of termination. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d). \nApplicant stated that his first real job was as a personal banker with a national \nbank chain. Prior to this job, he worked part-time jobs while going to school. He reported \nthat his job at the bank was to assist customers with their accounts, and to encourage \nthem to open new accounts. He asserted that newly opened accounts were an important \nmetric for management compensation. He stated that he was paid a flat salary and did \nnot earn a bonus. (Tr. 27-36, 68-92, GE 1, 2, 3) \nIn the eight months that Applicant worked at the bank, he reported that he was \ntrained by a more experienced banker on how to open accounts for customers. He claims \nthat he was told that a way to improve his monthly performance metrics was to contact \ncustomers about their existing accounts, and without their explicit approval open new \naccounts in their names for 30 days, and then close them at the end of that time period. \nHe asserted that no money needed to be moved. He testified that he watched his trainer \ndo this on several occasions, but did not do it himself. (Tr. 27-36, 68-92, GE 1, 2, 3) \nIn the summary report of his 2018 background interview with a government \ninvestigator, Applicant reported that he used this tactic to open accounts for customers \nthat he knew, such as family members or friends. He reported that he did this on about \nfour occasions. At the hearing, he denied opening the accounts himself. He testified that \nthe summary report was incorrect.

(Tr. 27-36, 68-92, GE 1, 2, 3)    \nIn early 2010, Applicant stated that his manager informed his team that there was \na customer complaint about an account that was opened without the customer\u2019s approval, \nand the bank chain was going to conduct an investigation. He reported that he quit his \njob before the investigation started. He asserted that he had already been looking to leave \nthis job to go into the government-contracting world, and he did not want to be in a position \nwhere he could be fired. He stated that he wanted to leave the door open to work in the \nbanking industry again in the future, if the government contracting career path did not \nwork out. He asserted that he was not personally confronted by the manager or told that \nhe would be fired or disciplined. He stated that he feared having a blemish on his \nemployment record, and this caused him to make the quick decision to quit that job. His \nnext two jobs were in government contracting. On his 2017 SCA, he stated that he left \nthis job to transition from commercial banking to government contracting, and that he was \nnot fired and did not quit after being told that he would be fired. (Tr. 27-36, 68-92, GE 1, \n2, 3)  \nThe way that these unapproved accounts were opened was not unique to the \nbranch that Applicant worked in. In 2020, the bank chain agreed to pay $3 billion to \nresolve criminal and civil investigations into opening customer accounts without \nauthorization. The Department of Justice stated that the bank pressured employees \nnationwide to meet unrealistic sales goals, which led to employees providing products or \naccounts under false pretenses or without consent. (AE F) \nIn June 2015, Applicant started working for a government contractor in a \nspecialized information technology field. He reported that when he started this position, \nthe deputy program manager (DPM) of the project told him that he needed to bill \u201cstraight \neights\u201d on his time card, but that if he worked longer hours, he could stockpile that time \nand use it as compensatory time off. He claimed that he would work out the time off \narrangements informally with the DPM. He stated that the work slowed shortly after he \nstarted working there, because they had already depleted most of the funding for the \ncontract, and later the company had lost the bid for contract renewal. During his \nemployment, he found other job openings in a similar practice area with a large \ngovernment contractor. A friend employed by that contractor referred him for one of these \npositions, and he had submitted applications for new employment to them by September \n27, 2015. (Tr. 19-27, 31-34, 39-68, 73, 88-105; GE 1, 2, 4, 5; AE B, C, D, E, G) \nOn October 7, 2015, Applicant was informed by his program manager (PM) that \nan audit was being conducted of employee time cards, and that the auditors wanted to \nmeet with him. He stated to the PM that he did not want to be involved in an audit. The \nPM told him that he could avoid the audit if he resigned, or he could meet with the auditor \nand find a new position with the company when the contract for his current position ended. \nApplicant stated that he had no reason to believe that he would be fired because of the \naudit, and his PM gave him no indication that was the case.

His resignation took effect \nimmediately. He reported that in this type of work, two weeks\u2019 notice was not necessary, \nbecause when an employee states that they are leaving, they are removed from the \nproject immediately for security reasons. The day after he resigned, he received an out-\nprocessing letter from company HR, which asked him to stay in touch and connected with \nthe company, and asked him to refer family and friends to work for them. There was no \nnegative language about his resignation in the out-processing letter. Later that month, he \nstarted working for the large government contractor with which he applied in late \nSeptember. On his 2017 SCA, he stated that he left this job because of minimal workload \nand that he was recruited for other work with a government contractor, and that he was \nnot fired and did not quit after being told that he would be fired. (Tr. 19-27, 31-34, 39-68, \n73, 88-105; AE D) \nIn 2019, Applicant was informed by his security officer at another employer that \nthere was an incident report about him from October 15, 2015, but they were not allowed \nto show it to him. In April 2019, he filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to \nobtain information about the report. It was not provided to him until Department Counsel \nsent him the report in January 2022. The report claims that in October 2015, he resigned \nin lieu of termination for violating company time-charging policy. It states that an \ninvestigation found that he mischarged 30.5 hours in the period of a week in late \nSeptember 2015, and it described instances of erratic behavior that month. Applicant \ndenied the allegations in the report. He stated that when he resigned he had no reason \nto believe that he would be terminated. His specialized knowledge, skills, and experience \nwould make termination unlikely for a timecard issue from one week of employment. He \nargued that it would not be possible to mischarge 30 hours in a week, as someone would \nimmediately notice that he had missed almost an entire week of work. In mid-September \n2015, he had oral surgery and a follow-up visit in late September. He stated that he did \nnot have enough leave banked to use for his recovery, and he was not permitted to take \nleave in advance of earning it. He reported that he had to come into work while still taking \nprescribed pain medications. The Government submitted 65 pages of employment \nrecords from this time period, and none corroborates the information in the incident report. \nThe one page that the Government cited as support is illegible.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal conduct \nApplicant sufficiently refuted the falsification allegations that he deliberately lied \nabout why he left his bank job in 2010 and government contactor job 2015.

Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for personal conduct under AG \u00b6 16 \nand the following are applicable: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of \nsensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's time or \nResources. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; \nApplicant disputes that he was involved in fraudulent activity in 2010 at his \njob with the bank, or that he resigned in lieu of termination.

These are unusual circumstances that are unlikely to recur, and it does \nnot cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Applicant\u2019s \nclaim that he quit his job to ensure that there was no blemish on his employment \nrecord is credible. AG \u00b6 17(c) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. \nApplicant disputes that he falsified his time card in September 2015 or that \nhe resigned in lieu of termination from the government contractor. Applicant \nprovided sufficient documentation to find that he had already been referred to \nanother employer, and submitted applications for new employment prior to his \nresignation from this job. His specialized knowledge, skills and experience allowed \nhim to easily obtain new employment with other government contractors. \nApplicant\u2019s narrative that he resigned because he did not want to participate in the \naudit and he believed that new employment was imminent is credible. \nAlthough it is possible that there could have been discrepancies on his \ntimecard from late September, the reason for such discrepancies would not be \nlimited to fraud. His descriptions of the DPM\u2019s instructions for billing \u201cstraight \neights\u201d on his timecard and compensatory time off are commonplace in \ngovernment contracting. The incident report only cites one week that Applicant \nmischarged time; it does not allege a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. The \nfact that Applicant had oral surgery six days prior to the time alleged, and a follow-\nup appointment during the week in question, shows great possibility for confusion \nand mistake. The conduct alleged occurred over seven years ago under \ncircumstances that are unlikely to reoccur, and it does not cast doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 17(c) and (f) applies to SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I considered his service to the government as a contractor. I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. \nI had the chance to observe Applicant\u2019s demeanor and asses his credibility. Under \npressure from extensive questioning by Department Counsel, his narrative was consistent \nand he more than adequately explained the circumstances surrounding the SOR \nallegations and the corollary issues in the record. I found his testimony and explanations \nto be credible, and the documentation that he submitted in the record was sufficient to \nsubstantiate his story. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant \nmitigated the personal conduct security concerns \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interest of the United \nStates to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He served honorably in the U.S. Army for 13 years. After leaving active duty he continued to work as a communications contractor with U.S. military forces overseas in various locations. He took evident pride in supporting the \u201cwar fighter\u201d in austere locations. (Tr. at 28.) He owned his U.S. residence from 2011 until 2018, when he lost the property due to foreclosure.

He submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) \nA through I, which were admitted without objection. I kept the record open until June 7, \n2023, to enable the parties to submit additional documentary evidence. At the request of \nApplicant\u2019s counsel, I extended the time without objection from the Government. In three \nsubmissions, Applicant submitted AE J through AE P; AE Q through AE R, and AE S \nthrough AE V, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) \nelectronically on May 15, 2023. The record closed on June 14, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted SOR \u00b6 1.a and denied the remaining \nallegations, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.h, with explanations. His admissions are incorporated in my \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He served honorably \nin the U.S. Army for 13 years. After leaving active duty he continued to work as a \ncommunications contractor with U.S. military forces overseas in various locations. He \ntook evident pride in supporting the \u201cwar fighter\u201d in austere locations. (Tr. at 28.) He \nowned his U.S. residence from 2011 until 2018, when he lost the property due to \nforeclosure. (GE 2 at 13.) He worked as a contractor in two areas of operation (AO) (AO \n-A and AO-B) where he was entitled to \u201chazardous and dangerous pay.\u201d In AO-A he \nresided in country from 2009 to 2014. He resided in AO-B 2014 to 2016. (GE 1 at 9-12.) \nHe stated he had a 70% decrease in his pay because of the differences in \u201chazardous \nand dangerous pay\u201d when he moved from AO-A to AO-B. (Tr. at 33.) From 2016 to 2018 \nhe resided in AO-C. When he was interviewed in November 2019 for his security \nclearance, he had been working and residing in a European country since January 2017. \nHe was required to file tax returns for the European country. (GE 1; GE 2 at 13; GE 7.) \nHe had been updating the IRS regarding his presence in a combat zone since 2015. The \nIRS responses to his emails provided details on when he would be required to file his tax \nreturns. (GE 6.) His January 10, 2019 email informed the IRS he was \u201cstill deployed in a \ncombat zone.\u201d (GE 6 at 5.) The IRS response to his email indicated the IRS was \u201cunable \nto update [his] account to show the Combat Zone Extension.\u201d (GE 6 at 6.) \nApplicant offered Exhibit U in his post-hearing submissions indicating his intention \nenroll in a debt management program (DMP) in May 2016. He listed over $56,000 of \nunsecured consumer debt in the DMP. The agreement estimated it would take 60 months \nto liquidate the debt and there would be an additional interest of over $14,000. He \nprovided no documentation of any transaction history of payments into the DMP, and he \nindicated he dealt with the debts himself.

(Tr. at 79.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: Applicant failed to file, as required, Federal income tax returns for \ntax years 2014 through at least 2019 and has an outstanding Federal tax liability of \napproximately $102,000. Applicant admits this concern. In August of 2019, the IRS \ncontacted him because of his failure to file tax returns. He acknowledged his failure to file \nhis tax returns in his security clearance interview and told the investigator he thought he \nwas tax exempt because he was overseas. He told the investigator in the November 2019 \nsecurity clearance interview he was in process of filing his Federal tax returns and that \nhe would \u201cfile his taxes in the future.\u201d (GE 2 at 15.) He testified \u201cI was in the impression \nthat I had six months to become compliant once I reached back to the United States for \neverything.\u201d He acknowledged in his testimony he had arrived in the European country in \n2018. He continued to claim the combat zone status as of January 2019. (Tr. at 69; GE 6 \nat 6.) He testified he hired an attorney in October or November of 2022, who was qualified \nto handle the complex tax issues he was facing due to taxes being withheld by a European \ncountry. (Tr. at 43; AE J.) He stated he was working with an accountant and an attorney \nto resolve his tax issues. (GE 2 at 10; Tr. at 42; AE J.) He indicated he had signed some \nforms but was not sure if he had filed tax returns for the relevant years. (Tr. at 64.) \nA May 2023 letter to DOHA from Applicant\u2019s tax preparer stated: \u201c[a]s of the date \nof this letter the un-filed returns for [Applicant] have been prepared to bring the account \ninto tax filing compliance. The request has been sent to IRS for a resolution of the \noutstanding balances, we are awaiting the determination of the assigned Revenue \nOfficer.\u201d (AE J.) In his post-hearing submission, Applicant offered AE V, consisting of the \nsecond page of an IRS Form 1040 that listed the tax year in parentheses for tax years \n2016 (refund $14,432), 2017 (owed $28,836), and 2019 (owed $1,661). The 2018 IRS \n1040 Form appeared to be a single page. It shows that he owed $15,734. All of the \ndocuments were signed on May 15, 2023. He also offered the IRS Form 8879 (e-file) for \ntax years 2020 and 2021 along with the second page of the IRS Form 1040. These \ndocuments were also dated May 15, 2023. \nApplicant testified he had made almost $65,000 in payments last year to the IRS. \n(Tr. at 42.) He documented four processed payments in January 2022 for: $4,989 (Tax \nYear 2005), $10,000 (Tax Year 2014), $10,000 (Tax Year 2016), and $5,000 (Tax Year \n2017) as well as a pending payment made in February 2022 of $9,611 (Tax Year 2002). \n(AE F and AE J.) He stated tax years 2020, 2021, and 2022 had not been filed but were \nin progress because of the concern about taxes being withheld by a foreign country. (Tr. \nat 65-66.) In explaining his delayed action, he also cited the complexity of his situation \ncaused by also being fully taxed by the European country where he had been living and \nworking. (Tr. at 63, 64, 65-66; AE O; AE P.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: Applicant is indebted to his employer in the approximate amount \nof $3,750.48, for an overseas income tax debt, which the employer paid for \nApplicant.

It was instead a debt related to a homeowners\u2019 association \n(HOA). He was unaware of the issue with his HOA until the garnishment action, and after \nhe investigated the matter he said, \u201cokay, go ahead and give it to them.\u201d (Tr. at 45; GE 5; \nAE D.) He believes the problem arose because the automatic payments to the HOA from \nhis credit card had stopped. The debt was \u201cgarnished from his paycheck with the \nagreement of [Applicant].\u201d The debt was resolved with one direct payment (Tr. at 45.) \nApplicant provided the email traffic with his employer to support his Answer. (AE D; Tr. at \n45-46.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: Applicant is indebted to a bank for loan that has been charged off \nin the approximate amount of $41,330. As of the date of the SOR the account \nremains delinquent. Applicant denied the debt and states in his Answer it was a disputed \ndebt that had been removed from his credit report. (AE C.) He had obtained a personal \nloan to put an extension on the back of his house. (Tr. at 47.) When he switched countries, \nhe testified he took a pay cut, which triggered financial hardships for him (Tr. 48, 49.) He \nstated \u201conce you get into a hole, it's hard to get out of a hole. It's a balancing act. And I \nwas trying to balance everything, and I was in over my head.\u201d (Tr. at 48.) He contacted \nthe bank recently and determined the account was inactive and closed. Because the \naccount was closed, he explained the bank did not \u201chave a mechanism for [him] to repay \nit.\u201d (Tr. at 49.) He acknowledged that his reason for denying the debt was because it was \nso old that it should not be on his credit report. (Tr. at 70-71; GE 3 at 6; GE 4 at 2; AE E.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: Applicant is indebted to a bank for a credit card account that has \nbeen charged off in the approximate amount of $11,488. As of the date of the SOR\nthe account remains delinquent.\n \n In his Answer Applicant denies this debt. He states it \nwas paid off in 2021 or 2022 and that it was removed from his credit report. (Tr. at 71; GE \n3 at 5; AE B.) He testified that he had documentation stating that the debt had been paid \nand that he verified that fact the day before the hearing by phone. He stated the bank \nwould send him correspondence to that fact because they could not provide it to him \nelectronically. (Tr. at 49.) He blamed the delinquency on a reduction in hazardous and \ndangerous pay when he moved countries. (Tr. at 50-51.) Applicant provided a February \ntransaction document dated February 28, 2022, showing a $7,000 payment to an attorney \nand a letter dated June 15, 2023, and faxed to him the same day stating: \u201cNow that you've \ncompleted your payments, we'll report the account to the consumer reporting agencies \nas settled for less than the full balance.

As of the date of the SOR the \naccount remains delinquent.\n \n In his Answer Applicant denied the allegation and disputed \nit on the basis the debt had been removed from his credit report. (GE 3 at 6; GE 4 at 2; \nAE E.) He opened the account in 2011 and the account was charged off in 2015. He \naffirmed that it was a legitimate debt and that he denied the debt because it was so old \nthat it should not be on his credit report. (Tr. at 72.)

An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony and the evidence admitted establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent taxes and unresolved debts \nare numerous and recent and ongoing. His inaction casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant\u2019s reason for failing to file tax returns for \nfive years was a misunderstanding of the tax law. Even considering this reason most \nfavorably for him as a condition beyond his control, he did not act responsibly. He had \nbeen in contact with the IRS informing the IRS of his status in a combat zone since 2015. \nThe IRS in January 2019 noted a discrepancy. He was aware of the problem in 2019. He \nfiled his tax returns for tax years 2016 through 2019 nine days before the hearing. His \nissues with foreign taxes only relate to his time working and residing in the European \ncountry, not his time in the different AOs. He was or should have been aware of the \nchanges in hazardous pay rates in each AO. He has been continually employed, so his \nfinancial circumstances were within his control. On the delinquent credit card debts and \nloans he has not addressed, he has relied on the fact they have fallen off his credit report. \nThe absence of the debts on Applicant\u2019s most recent credit report proves nothing about \nthe status of the debts except their age. Furthermore, merely waiting for a debt to drop \noff a credit report by the passage of time is not a factor in an applicant's favor. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001). \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is partially established. Applicant has sought assistance from an \nattorney and an accountant to resolve his issues. His issues have been ongoing since at \nleast 2019 and he believed he hired the attorneys in October or November of 2022. He \nstill has at least two tax years unresolved and an outstanding Federal tax liability. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. He did not take action to resolve his delinquent taxes \nor his debts until he began the security clearance process. Evidence of past \nirresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of debts only under pressure of qualifying for \na security clearance. While he made tax payments for different tax years in early 2022, \napplicants who begin to address their security-significant conduct only when their \npersonal interests are at stake may be lacking in judgment and reliability. ISCR Case No. \n16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018). A security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of \nan individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection \nprocedure. ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010.) Even if an applicant has \npaid his or her debts, an administrative judge may still consider the circumstances \nunderlying the debts for what they may reveal about the applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nclearance. ISCR Case No. 14-02394 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, 2015.) \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is not established. In regard to Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file his \nFederal income tax returns for tax years 2014 through 2019, the DOHA Appeal Board \nhas commented: \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd.

Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. \nBd. Dec. 20, 2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). The \nAppeal Board clarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has purportedly \ncorrected [his or her] Federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated \nto prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of \n[a]pplicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility\u201d including a failure to timely file Federal income tax returns. \nSee ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 & n.3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno \nharm, no foul\u201d approach to an applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employing an \u201call\u2019s well \nthat ends well\u201d analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified \ninformation with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-01031 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board explained \nthat in some situations, even if no taxes are owed when tax returns are not timely filed, \ngrant of access to classified information is inappropriate. In ISCR Case No. 15-1031 (App. \nBd. June 15, 2016) the applicant filed his 2011 Federal income tax return in December \n2013, his 2012 Federal tax return in September 2014, and his 2013 Federal tax return in \nOctober 2015. He received Federal tax refunds of at least $1,000 for each year. \nNevertheless, the Appeal Board reversed the administrative judge\u2019s decision to grant \naccess to classified information. \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal Board \nreversed the grant of a security clearance, discussed how AG \u00b6 20(g) applied, and noted: \nThe timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who \nbegins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that \nhis clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat \nto his own interests. In this case, applicant\u2019s filing of his Federal income tax \nreturns for 2009-2014 after submitting his SCA, undergoing his background \ninterview, or receiving the SOR undercuts the weight such remedial action \nmight otherwise merit. \nIn this instance, Applicant in his post-hearing submission provided evidence he \nfiled his overdue Federal income tax returns nine days before the hearing for tax years \n2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. He has not established a payment plan to address the \nFederal tax debt but has made some payments. However, the Appeal Board clarified that \neven in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [his or her] Federal [or \nstate] tax problem, and the fact that [a]pplicant is now motivated to prevent such problems \nin the future, does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant\u2019s security worthiness \nin light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility\u201d including a \nfailure to timely pay Federal income taxes when due. See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 \n& n.3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d approach to an \napplicant\u2019s course of conduct and employing an \u201call\u2019s well that ends well\u201d analysis as \ninadequate to support approval of access to classified information with focus on timing of \nfiling of tax returns after receipt of the SOR). \nApplicant has documented payments totaling over $39,000 to the IRS of a Federal \ntax liability of approximately $102,000. He should have been more diligent in monitoring \nhis tax obligations while residing overseas. Under all the circumstances, Applicant\u2019s \nfailures to timely file his Federal income tax returns for tax years 2014 through 2019 are \nnot mitigated at this time. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n       \n \n  \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).

DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on December 19, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.e., and 2.a. He \ndenied SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 2.b. and 2.c. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been \nemployed with the defense contractor since 2008. He is separated from his spouse, and \nhas four children, three of whom are adults. (TR at page 15 line 22 to page 17 line 15, \nand GX 1 at pages 7, 10, 14 and 17~18.) \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct & Guideline E: Personal Conduct \nAlthough it is not specifically alleged, most, if not all, of Applicant\u2019s Criminal and \nPersonal Conduct can be attributed to his addiction \u201cto Crystal Methamphetamines.\u201d \n(GX 2 at pages 4, 7 and 8.) His spouse, whose whereabouts are unknown, also has \nthis addiction problem. Applicant has been clean and sober since February 21, 2007, for \nabout 15 years, and actively helps others with their sobriety. (TR at page 25 line 7 to \npage 30 line 23.) \n1.a. and 2.c. Applicant admits that in April of 1999 he violated a protection order \nvis-\u00e0-vis his now, separated spouse. He was sentenced to \u201c30 day(s) incarceration,\u201d \npursuant to a guilty plea. (GX 3 at pages 1~3.) \n1.b., 2.a. and 2.c. Applicant admits that in April of 1999 he was also charged with \nAssault, a felony. Pursuant to his \u201cNo Contest\u201d plea, Applicant was initially sentenced to \nsix months of confinement and five years of probation. However, in May of 2002, he \nviolated that probation, which was revoked, and Applicant was sentenced to five years \nof confinement. While incarcerated he joined a prison street gang. (TR at page 20 line 2 \nto page 22 line 19, at pages 24 line 23 to page 25 line 6, and GX 3 at pages 4~9.) \n1.c. and 2.c. Applicant admits that in January of 2004, he was charged with \nresisting arrest, was convicted, and sentenced to 30 days confinement. (TR at page 22 \nline 20 to page 23 line 4.) \n1.d., 1.e. and 2.c. Applicant admits that in February of 2007, he was charged with \nUnauthorized Entry of a Dwelling, a felony; and in March of 2007, he was arrested and \ncharged with criminal contempt of court. In October of 2007, Applicant was sentenced to \none year of confinement (suspended) and placed on five years\u2019 probation.

Applicant denies that he falsified his 2019 SCA, in answer to \u201cSection 23 \u2013 \nIllegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity,\u201d by failing to disclose his participation in drug \nprograms in 2007. He avers, credibly, that he \u201cmisunderstood the question,\u201d and \n\u201cinadvertently answered it incorrectly.\u201d (Answer at page 3.) Applicant has since become \n\u201ca manager of the program.\u201d (TR at page 35 line 23 to page 36 line 14, and Answer at \npage 3.) His character and credibility in this regard are supported by those who know \nApplicant in the workplace. (AppX A.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \n\u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 sets forth the security concerns pertaining to criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted. \nApplicant has a history of criminal conduct, stretching from 1999~2007. As a \nresult, he spent five-plus years in confinement. The evidence establishes the above two \ndisqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 32 provides two conditions that could mitigate the above security concerns \nraised in this case: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant\u2019s Criminal Conduct ceased about 15 years ago. It can be attributed, for \nthe most part, to his drug abuse and addiction, from which he has been clean and \nsober, also for about 15 years. If fact, Applicant manages others towards sobriety. The \nevidence establishes mitigation under both above conditions. Criminal Conduct is found \nfor Applicant. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis disqualifying condition does not apply. Applicant\u2019s alleged falsification was \ninadvertent and not intentional. Personal Conduct is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines J and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant has \na distinguished history of working in the defense industry. (AppX A.) He performs his job \nwell. Applicant overcame his drug addiction more than 15 years ago, and since then has \ncompletely demonstrated rehabilitation and responsible conduct. No potential for \ncoercion or duress remains after this passage of time. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the Criminal \nConduct and Personal Conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1. a.~1.e: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2. a.~2.c: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201c[a]ny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindicator of, other issues of personnel security concern such as \nexcessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance misuse, or \nalcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .   \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may \nbe disqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations \nApplicant has significant past-due indebtedness. These facts establish prima \nfacie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shifts the burden to \nApplicant to mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes two conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant has over $112,000 in past-due debts that she has yet to address. \nAlthough she has had periods of underemployment or unemployment, she has done \nnothing to address her significant indebtedness. Financial Considerations is found \nagainst Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, \neligibility, and suitability for a security clearance. She has not met her burden to mitigate \nthe security concerns arising under the guideline for financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through1.u.: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings, testimony, and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 52 years old. She has earned a bachelor\u2019s degree, a master\u2019s degree \nin business administration (MBA), and a teaching certificate. She is employed as a project \nmanager by a large defense contractor at a naval shipyard and has worked there since \nSeptember 2009, largely in a cleared position.

She has no children of her own, but she is a licensed foster parent. (GE \n1; AE J; AE Q) \nThe SOR concerns six delinquent debts, discussed below. Applicant\u2019s debts are \nestablished by her admissions and by credit reports in the record, from May 2020, \nFebruary 2021, and February 2022, as well as a January 2020 credit report provided by \nApplicant after the hearing. (GE 3 at 3; GE 4 at 11-12, GE 2-GE 4; AE S at 5) \nApplicant testified that her financial problems began in March 2019, when she was \nhit by a car while walking her dog. She said her student loans were in good standing at \nthat point. She missed several months of work, and her student loans went into \nforbearance. She has been trying to work with her student loan provider since then. (Tr. \n25) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($93) and 1.b ($537) are debts that are past due to unidentified medical \ncreditors. (GE 2 at 2, GE 3 at 2) After Applicant\u2019s accident, she received a financial \nsettlement of about $100,000. She then was able to address her medical debts. (Tr. 30-\n32; AE C) She testified that she intended to pay certain medical debts first, such as the \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n$537 debt at SOR \u00b6 1.b, but that the creditor often assigned her payments to other debts. \n(Tr. 40-43) The settlement covered about $40,600 in specific medical expenses, with a \nremainder of about $59,000. (AE C) After addressing her medical debts, she then turned \nto other debts on her credit report. (Tr. 30-32, 40-43) \nA post-hearing document reflected $628 in medical debts with a collector. These \ndebt were incurred from 2015, 2016, 2020, 2021, and 2022. (AE R) It is not clear if these \ndebts are reflected in the SOR. They largely either pre-date the accident or are dated \nafter the accident settlement. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($405) is a debt that has been charged off by a money lender. Applicant \nalso asserted that this debt has been paid, and this payment is reflected in a January \n2020 credit report she provided. (Tr. 32, 55, 56-58; AE S at 6) Later credit reports show \na $200 past-due balance. (GE 2 at 7; GE 3 at 4) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f ($4,612) is a debt placed for collection. (GE 4 at 12) She believes this \ndebt has been paid off. (Tr. 33) A post-hearing document from January 2020 shows that \nthis debt rose to $5,212. (AE S at 5) It is not reflected on later credit reports. Applicant did \nnot provide documentation that this debt is being resolved. \nThe two largest debts by far are Applicant\u2019s delinquent federal student loans, SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.c ($114,425) and 1.d ($58,775), totaling $173,200. (GE 2 at 6; AE S at 5) This is \nalmost exactly the amount reflected in the post-hearing document she submitted detailing \nher student loans. ($154,815 in principal and $18,386 in interest, totaling $173,201). (AE \nP) The most recent credit report in the record, from February 2022, shows that the \naccounts are in \u201cPays as Agreed\u201d status, with no past-due amount. No payment amount \ndue is reflected, however. (GE 2 at 6) \nApplicant financed her graduate education and some of her certificates through \nstudent loans. She had a scholarship in college. She was working on paying them off until \nher accident in March 2019. Until then, her loans were in good standing. She then put her \nloans into forbearance status. (Tr. 24-26, 38, 44-45) Credit reports reflect that they \nbecame delinquent in about March 2020, but that they were also delinquent in 2018 and \n2019. (GE 2 at 3-4). \nFollowing the accident, Applicant was out of work for about four months, until July \n2019, and she fell behind on her bills. She was on short-term disability before going back \nto work. (Tr. 26-27, 33-34; GE 1; AE B) At the time of her accident, she was making \nminimum payments on her loans to keep them current. (Tr. 36, 77) \nAE A is a document from Applicant\u2019s loan-rehabilitation company, dated April 24, \n2020. At that time, she owed $154,314 in principal plus $18,386 interest, and $31,037 in \ncollection costs, for a total of $203,737. She was in discussions with the company but has \nhad trouble figuring out who to contact. She had yet to formalize an agreement or put it \ninto effect. (Tr. 34-35, 77-78) She hopes to have her loans forgiven.

Federal student loan payments remain paused until June 30, 2023. See \nhttps://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19. \nApplicant said she is also working part-time to earn more income. She works as a \nsubstitute teacher and in sports therapy, providing therapy to children. Her income from \nthose positions is limited. (Tr. 47-53, 75, AE G, AE H) She takes home about $3,900 a \nmonth from her full-time job at the shipyard. (Tr. 59) She has about $2,300 in checking \nand savings accounts combined.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out, \nin relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent student loans and other debts are established by her \nadmissions and by credit reports in the record. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; \nApplicant\u2019s finances were significantly impacted after she was hit by a car in 2019. \nShe missed several months of work and was on short-term disability. She incurred \nmedical expenses and fell behind on other debts. She placed her student loans into \nforbearance but by early 2020 they were delinquent. The first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) \ntherefore applies. \nApplicant\u2019s medical debts were largely resolved through the $100,000 financial \nsettlement that she received after the accident, probably including the debts at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a and 1.b. However, her student-loan debts remain, as does the debt at SOR \u00b6 1.f.\nWhile payments have been paused under Executive Orders due to the pandemic, her\nstudent loans were delinquent before the Executive Orders and Applicant did not\nestablish that she has undertaken responsible efforts to address them in the past, and \nshe has yet to put forth a responsible plan for dealing with them now. Her student-loan\ndebts now total over $170,000. Her debts are ongoing, and they are not being resolved\nand are not under control. Other than as specified above, AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and\n20(d) do not fully apply to mitigate her significant financial debts.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. \nApplicant put forth significant whole-person evidence to consider. She is a \ndedicated foster parent, and she is working multiple jobs to make ends meet. She also is \na valued employee at the shipyard and has been there for several years. She has earned \na bachelor\u2019s degree and a master\u2019s degree, as well as several certificates. But she has \nnot put forth a responsible plan to address her overwhelming federal student-loan debt, \nnor has she taken real steps to put any such plan into effect, such as by establishing a \ntrack record of steady payments. She did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the \nsecurity concern shown by her delinquent debts. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to her eligibility for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c, 1.d, 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

He placed the vehicle in storage and in his \nfather\u2019s care when he deployed in 2009. The vehicle was later wrecked, probably by his \nsister, who was not authorized to drive it. Applicant contacted the creditor to reacquire the \nvehicle at the end of the lease, but never got confirmation. The account remained \nunresolved for several years, until 2018, when he learned it remained on his credit report \nas a charge off. Subsequent efforts to contact the creditor and resolve his responsibility \nfor the debt proved largely fruitless. The debt remains unresolved. However, the unusual, \nisolated nature of the debt, as well as its age and origins beyond his control are factors \nto be considered in mitigation. No other past-due debts are evident on his current credit \nreport. Financial considerations security concerns are mitigated.

(GE 3 \nat 6) Applicant leased a one-ton truck in 2007, when he joined the Army. In about 2009, \nshortly before the end of the lease, he was to deploy overseas, so he drove the vehicle \nfrom his west coast duty station to State 1 and put it into storage. He said he had storage \ninsurance but not driving insurance. He left his father in charge of the vehicle. In about \n2010, when he was arranging to return the vehicle at the end of the lease, Applicant \nlearned from his father that his sister had driven the vehicle without permission and \nwrecked it. His father said he would pay to repair it but did not do so. When Applicant \ncontacted the leasing company from Iraq to recover the vehicle, he said he was told they \nwould contact him if there were any issues and never did so. He understood the vehicle \nwould be picked up and taken to an auto dealer in State 1. He assumed that is what \nhappened but never received documentation. (GE 1 at 37-38; GE 2 at 3; Answer; Tr. 23-\n24, 28-36, 41-51, 57, 68-72) \nApplicant testified that it was his understanding that when representatives came to \nrepossess the vehicle, they decided not to take it. He said his father told him the vehicle \nwas no longer at the storage unit. He returned from Iraq in September 2010 to his west \ncoast duty station. He assumed at that point that the vehicle had been picked up. He \nnever saw the vehicle again and does not know where it is. In 2018, the recovery team \ncame to his home to ensure that he did not have the vehicle. He has made numerous \ncalls to the creditor\u2019s asset recovery unit to find out what happened with the vehicle. He \nacknowledged that he did not know the true cost of the damage to the vehicle after his \nsister wrecked it. At some point thereafter, the storage company went out of business. \n(Answer; Tr. 23-36, 46, 52-56, 68-72) \nApplicant acknowledged that after returning home in 2010, he took no further \naction to confirm the status of the vehicle. In about 2018, the unresolved lease appeared \non his credit report when he tried to buy a house. He said he initially was to owe about \n$19,000, but when he called to make arrangements to pay, he was told that the full \nbalance of the lease was owed (about $39,000) apparently since the vehicle was never \nrecovered. He believes he may have been protected from paying on the debt by the \nServicemembers\u2019 Civil Relief Act (SCRA) when he was in the military, but acknowledged \nthat, if so, that protection ended when he left the Army. (Answer; Tr. 23-24, 31-36, 56, 57-\n60, 63-64) \nApplicant said once he learned that the debt remained unresolved in 2018, he \ncontacted the creditor every six months or so. He disclosed the debt on his October 2019 \nSCA. (GE 1 at 38; Tr. 41) He e-mailed the creditor in early January 2022. The creditor \nresponded that day and said they wanted to talk to him. Applicant wrote back in late March \n2022, noting he had not heard from the creditor. He then e-mailed the creditor\u2019s CEO. \nThe creditor responded three days later and said they were \u201cresearching your concern \nand will provide a timely response soon.\u201d (AE B; Tr. 23-27, 49, 61-62) No response was \nforthcoming.

(Tr. 22) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe AGs are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the factors \nlisted in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative \ngoal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person \nconcept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven \nby Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following AGs are potentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe two delinquent debts alleged in the SOR are established by the record \nevidence, including Applicant\u2019s admissions, credit reports, and testimony. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \nWhen he joined the military in 2007, Applicant leased a truck. When he deployed \nin 2009, he put the truck in storage in another state and left it in the care of his father. At \nsome point thereafter, his sister drove the truck without permission and wrecked it. It is \nnot entirely clear what happened next. Evidently the truck was returned to the storage \nunit. His father told him about the accident and promised to pay to fix it but did not do so. \nIn 2010 or so, while still deployed, Applicant contacted the creditor to arrange return of \nthe vehicle at the end of the lease, to a local dealer. Evidently, the creditor went to the \nstorage unit to recover the truck, probably found that it was damaged, and did not take \npossession. It is unclear what happened to the truck after that. Applicant assumed the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmatter had been resolved but did not pursue confirmation of the status of the truck from \nthe creditor when he returned to his west coast duty station from Iraq, in September 2010. \nApplicant thought little more about the matter until 2018, when the unresolved debt \nappeared on his credit report when he tried to buy a house. He began contacting the \ncreditor to ascertain the status of the debt, without success. He provided e-mails from \nearly 2022, after he received the SOR, documenting further efforts. He has heard little \nfrom the creditor and has not received documentation of what they believe he owes. He \nsays he will pay what he owes if an amount is confirmed. SOR debt \u00b6 1.a, now years old, \nremains charged off and unresolved, though it no longer appears on credit reports. \nApplicant has no other delinquent debt on recent credit reports. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is paid and resolved. SOR \u00b6 1.a, while large, is also isolated and very \ndated. The fact that it no longer appears on Applicant\u2019s credit reports does not preclude \nits consideration as a current security concern. It is also a continuing course of conduct, \nsince it is not clearly established that it is resolved. While AG \u00b6 20(a) therefore does not \nfully apply, the debt occurred under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment \nAG \u00b6 20(b) also has some application. Applicant\u2019s financial woes began after his \nsister took his truck from storage without permission and wrecked it. This was a \ncircumstance beyond his control. After he returned from Iraq in 2010, he did not verify the \nstatus of the truck with the creditor and did not confirm that his responsibility for the leased \nvehicle was concluded. The lease ended years ago, and the debt no longer appears on \nApplicant\u2019s credit report. His efforts to pursue resolution since 2018have proven fruitless. \nApplicant\u2019s debts were incurred due to circumstances largely beyond his control. His \ndebts are limited to this circumstance, and he has acted responsibly in addressing them, \nasserting his willingness to pay and resolve the debt. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(c):  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. I considered Applicant\u2019s prior military service, \nstatus as a 100% disabled veteran, and the fact that the debt at issue is old, isolated, \nunusual, and unlikely to recur. I had the opportunity to observe Applicant\u2019s demeanor \nduring the hearing and conclude that he testified credibly about the circumstances of the \ndebt and his intentions to resolve it. Applicant is also gainfully employed and has a steady \nadditional stream of compensation due to his disability. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. I conclude Applicant provided sufficient evidence to mitigate the \nfinancial security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is granted. \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

Adjudicators regard seeking \nnecessary mental health treatment as a positive step in the security clearance process.\u201d \nThe following discussion will be primarily chronological. In general terms, Applicant \nhas been suffering from severe and chronic depression for approximately 30 years. This \ndepression first manifested itself when he was in the Army, specifically during his \nAdvanced Individual Training cycle in 1993. Applicant eventually was hospitalized for \nseveral months at a military medical facility and then discharged from the Army. During \nthat time his depression manifested itself in auditory hallucinations and incidents of self \nharm. These hallucinations would continue on an occasional basis. Applicant testified that \nhe last had auditory hallucinations before moving to his current state of residence in 2016. \n(Tr. 19-23.) \nThe Government submitted Applicant\u2019s Department of Veteran\u2019s Affairs (VA) \nmedical records from 1996 to 2015. (Government Exhibit 9.) The records indicate that he \nhas been suffering from suicidal ideation for many years. He agrees that there were many \noccasions when he would obsessively think about suicide. He moved from the thought \nstage to suicidal gestures at least five times (sometime between 1992 and 1996, 1999, \n2012, 2013, and 2014). During all of these occasions he was receiving treatment at \nseveral VA facilities and suicide prevention measures were taken by his mental health \nproviders. Applicant testified that he has not made any suicide gestures since 2014. \nHowever, he continued to have suicidal ideation until at least 2020. Applicant testified that \nthe therapy he is undergoing has helped him \u201cto manage when things start to get to a \npoint, you know, how to navigate through those feelings.\u201d (Tr. 26-32, 40.) \nApplicant specifically denied in his Answer that he was hospitalized in 1996 at a \nVA hospital after a suicide attempt as alleged in SOR 1.c. The available medical records \ndo not show any such hospitalization, but they are incomplete or unclear because of age. \nApplicant was interviewed by a Government investigator on January 3, 2018. A Report of \nInvestigation (ROI) was prepared after the interview. The investigator reported Applicant \nstated, \u201cAt an unrecalled point between 1992 and 1995 (discrepant), he [Applicant] was \nhospitalized for two days at . . . V.A. Clinic.\u201d Applicant testified that he was evaluated at \nthe VA facility and released, but was not hospitalized. (Government Exhibit 8 at 7; Tr. 26.) \nApplicant has received active treatment at various VA facilities for various mental \nhealth issues including major depressive disorder, psychosis, dysthymic disorder, bipolar \ndisorder, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, post-traumatic stress disorder, and alcohol \ndependence. This treatment started in 1996 and continues to the present. The medical \nrecords show gaps in Applicant\u2019s treatment ranging from months to years. For example, \nApplicant received no treatment at the VA from 2005 to 2009. Applicant has been on \nmedication therapy repeatedly during his treatment. However, he has repeatedly \ndiscontinued the treatment over the years due to severe side effects. (Government Exhibit \n9; Attachment I; Applicant Exhibits C and D; Tr. 25.) \n3 \n\n \nPROGNOSIS \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant received an evaluation from a DoD mental health consultant in April \n2020. The consultant interviewed Applicant, conducted various screening tests, and \nreviewed Applicant\u2019s mental health records. He diagnosed Applicant as suffering from \nMajor Depressive Disorder, recurrent, in partial remission; Posttraumatic Stress Disorder; \nand Alcohol Use Disorder, Mild. (Government Exhibits 6 and 7.) \nThe consultant\u2019s report stated the following: \nThe prognosis for [Applicant\u2019s] full recovery from major depressive disorder \nis guarded. [Applicant] reports a partial improvement after ongoing mental \nhealth treatment since 1996 and intermittent compliance with regimen and \nmedications. Given the chronicity of symptoms, the course is expected to  \ncontinue to be chronic and fluctuating with remissions and exacerbations \nbecause his symptoms continue to cause some disruption in daily function. \nThe prognosis for [Applicant\u2019s] full recovery from PTSD symptoms is fair to \ngood. His symptoms remain persistent and disruptive, however, he has not \ncompleted a course of evidence-based trauma therapy. Thus, it is unknown \nhow his symptoms will respond to trauma-focused treatment. \n[Applicant] is moderately motivated to resume mental health treatment. He \nverbalized his pessimism that his symptoms will improve significantly given \nhis long history of mental health treatment to include psychotherapy and \nmultiple psychotropic medication in the past that he often stopped due to \nnegative side effects that were not tolerated. He is primarily motivated by \nhis chronic psychic pain, but at the same time remains pessimistic about \nsymptom reduction and relief. [Applicant] has no financial, logistical, \ncultural, or intellectual barriers. His pessimism about the efficacy of mental \nhealth treatment may be a barrier to his efforts in therapy and making \nchanges as well as compliance with psychotropic medication. There is a \nhigh potential of recurrence of major depressive symptoms and PTSD, \nparticularly as he is not engaged in mental health treatment at his time. \nThe prognosis for [Applicant\u2019s] alcohol use disorder is guarded. He has \nexperienced three episodes of drinking in the last 12 months, has a long \nhistory of maladaptive use of alcohol (binge drinking), and has been \nrecommended for alcohol treatment multiple times throughout his VA \ntreatment. His most recent referral of alcohol treatment per VA records was \nNovember 2019. He has no history of substance abuse treatment. He has \nnot demonstrated a recent pattern of abstinence. He drinks responsibly (at \nhome). He does acknowledge his issues of alcohol abuse. His use is \nexpected to recur during major depressive episodes. His previous binge \n4 \n\n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndrinking has impaired his judgment as evidenced by alcohol intoxication \nduring a previous suicide attempt. \nBased upon the available information, [Applicant] does evidence a material \ndefect in stability due to his chronic mood instability, chronic and repeated \nmaladaptive use of alcohol without follow-through on recommended alcohol \ntreatment, minimal improvement in his major depressive disorder and PTSD \ndiagnosis since 1996, intermittent adherence to mental health treatment \nregimen, and lifetime and recent history of suicidal ideation and multiple \nsuicide attempts. There is a potential security concern that he is not actively \naddressing his co-occurring mental and substance use disorders. Of \nparticular concern is the recent suicidal ideation and lack of help-seeking as \nevidenced by not resuming mental health treatment since November 2019 \n(last therapy session). Continued mental health treatment is recommended \nas well as substance abuse treatment given his recurrent maladaptive use \nof alcohol. It is unlikely that education alone will adequately address his \nproblematic use of alcohol and treatment should include some form of \naddictions therapy and exposure to appropriate community support groups. \nIt appears that [Applicant] finds much meaning and purpose in his work and \nthis seems to motivate him and [is] a major factor that seems to propel him \nto maintain his work attendance, efficiency, and performance. He was \nreluctant to seek alcohol treatment after being referred in November 2019 \nbecause of concern about divulging his need for treatment to his work \nsupervisor, but would likely be highly motivated to seek both mental health \nand alcohol treatment to maintain his security clearance and continue to be \nemployed at [his employer]. The acknowledgment of the nature of the \nprevious concerns and positive feedback from his current work supervisor \non [Applicant\u2019s] work performance without concerns of his reliability, \nstability, and trustworthiness from his perspective are favorable to the \nsubject [Applicant] (Government Exhibit 6 at 9-10.) (All emphasis in \noriginal.)  \nIn August 2021 Applicant contacted his VA psychologist. She wrote a progress \nnote based on his message and her response. (Attachment D.) He referenced the part of \nGovernment Exhibit 6 where the consultant stated that Applicant\u2019s condition may impair \nhis \u201cjudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\u201d Applicant then stated: \nI wanted to use my medical record to show that his isn\u2019t the case, however \nthere are several areas in which you noted that \u201cinsight and judgment were \npoor.\u201d I\u2019m certainly not disagreeing with the diagnosis. I\u2019m trying to figure \nout how to mitigate this for the administrative judge handling my case. It \nseems impossible but if you have any ideas, I\u2019d appreciate it.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe psychologist spoke to Applicant and reported the following in Attachment D: \nVeteran [Applicant] returned writer\u2019s call and he was reached. Discussed \nconcept insight/judgment that he had mentioned in his email \u2013 let Veteran \nknow that most [people] who are acutely symptomatic (e.g., with severe \ndepression, PTSD) will have poor insight and judgment but that this is \nchangeable with treatment. Veteran verbalized understanding. Writer asked \nif it would be helpful for me to provide documentation stating that Veteran \nhas been attending sessions and motivated for care.  \nApplicant\u2019s VA psychologist submitted a letter on his behalf dated August 23, 2021, \nwhich stated: \nThis letter serves to confirm that [Applicant] has been an active participant \nin mental health treatment through the VA . . . Healthcare System. He \nattended a group treatment which emphasized skills designed to broadly \nimprove emotional regulation and tolerance of distress (February 2021 until \nMay 2021). [Applicant] then elected to enroll in individual treatment with me \nin order to receive more tailored, specific care to his mental health problems \n(May 2021 until August 2021). During our time working together, [Applicant] \nwas always responsive to treatment suggestions and willing to implement \nnew strategies. It is my belief that [Applicant] is absolutely motivated to \ncontinue mental health treatment. (Attachment E.) \nVA records show, and Applicant\u2019s testimony confirmed, that he was working with \na VA Primary Care Mental Health Integration (PC-MHI) team beginning in December \n2020 through August 2021 and May 2022 to at least July 2022. These meetings are on a \nweekly or bi-weekly basis. The VA explained, \u201cPC-MHI integrates mental health staff into \neach PACT [Patient Aligned Care Team], allowing your care team to provide services for \ndepression, anxiety, PTSD, and substance use without needing a separate consult with \nmental health providers outside of the PACT clinic area.\u201d (Department of Veterans Affairs, \nPatient Care Services: Primary Care \u2013 Mental Health Integration (PC\u2013MHI), \nhttps://www.patientcare.va.gov/primarycare/PCMHI.asp (last updated Sep. 19, 2022.) \n(Applicant Exhibits C and D; Tr. 25, 33-35, 47-52.) \nApplicant finds his current work very fulfilling. He testified that his current mental \nhealth situation is good, stating, \u201cTo be honest, I think this is the best I have felt in a long \ntime. Particularly, this year has been really good. I\u2018m not sure what exactly changed. \nYeah, it\u2019s been good.\u201d (Tr. 40-41, 47.) \nIn conclusion Applicant stated, \u201cI don\u2019t see how I should be punished. I am seeking \n\u2013 and continue to seek \u2013 mental health treatment. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a punishable action.

It\u2019s not even a thought in my head to do any of those things.\u201d (Tr. \n54.) \nParagraph 2 (Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption) \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he abuses intoxicants to excess. He admitted in part and denied in part SOR \n2.a. He denied SOR 2.b and 2.c with explanations. \nApplicant has consumed alcohol on an occasional basis since 2006. Occasionally \nhe has used alcohol to excess in terms of binge drinking. In 2010 he would drink a bottle \nof liquor every two weeks or so when he was depressed. Applicant testified that he last \ndrank what he considers a binge amount of alcohol in early 2022. (Tr. 27-29, 36.) \nOn at least two occasions Applicant consumed alcohol and took pills in aborted \nsuicide attempts. Binge drinking was also related to occasions when he would have \nobsessional thoughts about suicide. These incidents continued through at least 2014. \n(Government Exhibit 9 at 45, 73, 78-79; Tr. 28-30.) \nApplicant admitted that in 2019 the VA recommended that he attend alcohol \ntreatment. Applicant declined the offer because of work-related concerns and concerns \nrelated to a previous psychiatric hospitalization. He admitted that treatment may have \nbeen recommended to him in approximately 2016. He further testified that he does not \nfeel he has an alcohol problem. In his 2016 questionnaire he stated, \u201cTreatment was \nsuggested but never became required. Since I knew the situation was manageable, I did \nnot take action to seek treatment.\u201d (Government Exhibit 2 at Section 24; Attachment G; \nTr. 38-40.) \nApplicant told the DoD mental health consultant that he had three binge drinking \nepisodes in 2019. Based on his evaluation the consultant diagnosed Applicant with \nAlcohol Use Disorder, Mild. (Government Exhibit 6 at 6-7, 9-10.) \nMitigation \nApplicant was elected as a member of his local school board in 2020. His term \nexpires in 2024, unless he decides to run for reelection. He finds this job very fulfilling. In \nhis Answer at page 2 he stated, \u201cDealing with personnel, financial, and educational \nmatters that affect parents, students, faculty, and the surrounding community requires a \nhigh-degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness.\u201d He further testified about serving \non the school board, \u201cSomething I can engage in with the community is always helpful. I \nthink it makes me feel a part of something more involved.\u201d (Tr. 43-44.) \nApplicant\u2019s department manager submitted a letter on his behalf. The manager \nhas known Applicant since 2016, when Applicant began work there. The writer stated, \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cSince the moment I met [Applicant], he has always conducted himself in a professional \nand courteous manner and has been a privilege to work with, he has a strong work ethic \nand has always worked well with leadership and his colleagues.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit A.) \n(See the department manager\u2019s interview with the DoD mental health consultant, \nGovernment Exhibit 6 at 9.) \nApplicant\u2019s group supervisor submitted a letter. He has also known Applicant for \nsix years. He stated: \n[Applicant] inspires the team with his extraordinary work ethic and \ninnovative solutions he brings to our work. He is someone who projects a \nreal sense of self-confidence and assurance, without coming across as \narrogant or dismissive of others. [Applicant] is someone I can trust to rise to \nchallenges and deal with difficult situations. As I grew into my current \nposition as the supervisor of the group, [Applicant\u2019s] behavior has stayed \nconsistent throughout, making it easy to earn my trust. (Applicant Exhibit \nB.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline I: Psychological Conditions) \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Psychological Conditions is set \nout in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 28 contains five conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Four conditions may be applicable: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors; \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability or \ntrustworthiness; \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \nWith regard to Guideline I, no adverse inference has been drawn because of \nApplicant\u2019s obtaining mental health treatment or his hospitalizations. Specifically, AG \u00b6 \n28(c) is not applicable to this case.  \nThe record shows that Applicant has been suffering from severe and chronic \ndepression for decades. Before he moved to another state in 2016 the record is clear that \nhe had major issues, including several suicide attempts and repeated bouts of suicidal \nthoughts and ideation. The record also shows that his mental health has improved \ndramatically after his move and with the onset of his new job, where he has worked \nsuccessfully for over six years. AG \u00b6 28(a) applies to this case. \nIn 2020 a DoD mental health consultant found that Applicant had a condition that \nmay impair his judgment, stability, reliability, and trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 28(b) applies. \nAt various times in his treatment Applicant has been prescribed various drugs. He \nhas taken them for various periods of time. He has ended his use of prescribed drugs due \nto severe side effects and his belief that they are not being helpful to him. The medical \nrecords show that in all other ways Applicant has been amenable and responsive to \ntreatment. AG \u00b6 28(d) is minimally applicable to the facts of this case. \nThe Government has met its burden under the Directive to establish the above \ndisqualifying conditions. Accordingly, the burden shifts to Applicant to mitigated them. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 29 contains five conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Four of them have possible application to this case: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nAs stated, Applicant has been suffering with severe depression for many years. \nHis testimony, and the available medical records, show a person who has striven mightily \nto get control of his emotional problems. He has used the VA over the years to assist him, \nand the records confirm that he has, in the main, followed treatment recommendations \nand had successful therapy. Looked at as a whole, it is clear that his mental health and \ndepression has improved dramatically over the years. In particular, there is evidence that \nit has improved since the interview with the DoD mental health consultant in April 2020. \nSince then, Applicant was elected to his local school board, an event and a position he \nobviously would not have been mentally or emotionally competent to handle if he was still \nsuffering from the depressive episodes of his past. In addition, the statements of his two \nsuperiors are excellent. \nApplicant\u2019s VA therapist opined in 2021 that he was \u201cresponsive to treatment \nsuggestions and willing to implement new strategies.\u201d She also stated, \u201cIt is my belief that \n[Applicant] is absolutely motivated to continue mental health treatment.\u201d (Attachment E.) \nThis discussion will start with the mitigating condition that is most favorable to \nApplicant. Based on the totality of the available evidence, I find that there is no indication \nof a current problem. That has been true for about two years. AG \u00b6 29(e) applies to the \nfacts. However, that is not the end of the discussion. \nThe records show that Applicant has not been consistent with his VA care over the \nyears. He is primarily compliant, particularly recently. His psychologist says he is \nmotivated to continue treatment, but that does not amount to a favorable prognosis as \nrequired by the Directive. AG \u00b6 29(a) and (b) are minimally applicable under the \ncircumstances of this case. \nAG \u00b6 29(c) does not apply because there is not a current mental health finding that \nthe previous condition is under control or in remission and has a low possibility of \nrecurrence or exacerbation. The statement by Applicant\u2019s current psychologist, while \nhelpful, does not meet the requirements of the guideline. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant is highly commended for all he has done to improve his mental health \nover the years. Once again, it is obvious that he has showed tremendous improvement. \nHowever, the strictures of the Guidelines as written require more from Applicant in terms \nof consistency of treatment and a current and favorable prognosis that rebuts the current \nreport by the Government\u2019s mental health consultant. Given the current state of the record \nI cannot find that Applicant has sufficiently mitigated the security concerns raised by the \nevidence in this case. Guideline I is found against Applicant. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for alcohol consumption are set out \nin AG \u00b6 21, which states: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol\nuse disorder;  \n \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; and \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed. \nApplicant has a history of binge drinking, which continued through early 2022. \nApplicant was diagnosed by a DoD mental health consultant with Alcohol Use Disorder, \nMild in 2020. There is also evidence that he has been referred for substance abuse \ntreatment at least twice, the last time in 2019. He has not obtained such treatment. All \nthree of the Disqualifying Conditions apply, thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to \nmitigate them. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 23 contains four conditions that could mitigate alcohol \nconsumption security concerns. \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness or \njudgment; \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations;  \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nNone of these mitigating conditions was established by the evidence in this case. \nA review of Applicant\u2019s medical records indicate that alcohol has been a problem in his \nlife. During his younger days it was involved in several cases of attempted suicide or \nsuicidal ideation. He admitted that he still uses alcohol as a means to self-medicate during \ntimes of stress or depression. A finding on Applicant\u2019s behalf cannot be made at this point \nin time. Guideline G is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has made great \nstrides in resolving his longstanding mental health issues, and related alcohol issues. \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWith continued work and support from the VA, specifically aimed at the Government\u2019s \nconcerns, Applicant may well be eligible in the future for a clearance. However, the record \nevidence does create substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national \nsecurity eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d and 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

Tr. 28-29; AE-AO, AE-AP, AE-AQ, AE-AR; \nHE VIII) \nIn April 2018, Applicant was hospitalized. Her medical records reflect that she had \na long history of encephalopathy of unknown origin and was diagnosed with acute \nencephalopathy, pneumonia, and sepsis. Encephalopathy is a term for any disease of the \nbrain that alters brain function or structure. It may be caused by other medical issues. The \nhallmark of it is an altered mental state. Common neurological symptoms are progressive \nloss of memory and cognitive abilities, subtle personality changes, inability to concentrate, \nlethargy, and progressive loss of consciousness.2 At the time of her admission to the \nhospital her husband reported she had a cough, fever, and confusion and was not making \nsense. She testified that at that time, the doctors did not know if the encephalopathy or \nsepsis was the cause of her symptoms. She was discharged several days later, returned \nto work for ten days, and then relapsed. She was taken to a university hospital and was \nadmitted for encephalopathy and psychosis. She was an inpatient for a week and \ndischarged. She tried to work the month of May but was having recurring headaches and \nwent to the community hospital two more times in May 2018. (Tr. 29-31; AE-AO, AE-AQ, \nAE-AR, HE VIII) \nIn June 2018, Applicant voluntarily went to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \nhospital and was admitted. She made comments of a suicide nature to one of the resident \nphysicians and the admission was converted to an involuntary admission. She explained \nshe became frustrated and should not have made the comments she did. She was tired \nof the probing and said she was sick of being questioned and said if the window was \nopen, she would jump out of it. They were on the second floor. She did not mean this as \na suicidal statement, but more one of frustration. She spent four days in the hospital. (Tr. \n31-34; GE 5; AE-AR) \nIn June 2018, when Applicant went to the VA hospital because she was having \nchest pains, foggy vision and altered mental status. She said she lost voluntary control at \nthe time and felt like she was at the bottom of a pool and unable to respond to stimuli \naround her. She acknowledged having impaired reality testing (such as auditory and \nvisual hallucinations and delusional beliefs). She had periods of severe confusion, \ncognitive problems or forgetfulness, distractibility, losing her train of thought, slow thinking \nand word finding difficulties. She indicated that beginning in May 2018 she was perceiving \nthings that were not real. Applicant was on medical leave from her employment from June \n2018 to June 2019.

She has been Dr. D\u2019s patient since June 2018. It is reported that \nApplicant began having confusion, disorientation, inability to communicate and seizures \nin late 2018. She was diagnosed with epilepsy in approximately June 2019 and takes \nanti-seizure medication for the epilepsy. (Tr. 34-39, 45-46; AE U) \nDr. D provided a letter from June 2019 stating she had been treating Applicant \nsince June 2018 for depression disorder and anxiety disorder. Applicant had been \ncompliant with treatment and recommendations and had achieved her baseline. She \nstated that Applicant would benefit from returning to work part-time. In April 2021, Dr. D \nprovided another letter to provide a summary of Applicant\u2019s care. She indicated that \nApplicant initially had an altered mental status secondary to an infection of unknown \nsource and not from a primary psychiatric disorder. She noted that Applicant should not \nhave been admitted involuntarily to the psychiatric floor in June 2018 but should have \nbeen placed on the medical floor. After an extensive medical work up, Applicant was \ndiagnosed with epilepsy, double pneumonia, sepsis, and encephalopathy. These all \naffected her cognitive ability. She has been somewhat depressed due to her cognitive \ndecline, short term memory loss, seizures, and lifestyle modifications. Dr. D noted that \nher neurologist helped control her seizures. She returned to work in September 2019. \nShe was discharged from Dr. D\u2019s care in approximately January 2020. Applicant reached \nout to Dr. D again after receiving the SOR and throughout 2021 and in the beginning of \n2022. (Tr. 46-48, 132-136; AE S, T) \nIn December 2020, Applicant participated in a mental health evaluation with Dr. B, \na psychologist approved by the government. Dr. B administered psychological tests to \nApplicant. The results were considered normal and there was no significant \npsychopathology. Applicant\u2019s responses were below average for motivation for treatment. \nDr. B diagnosed Applicant with unspecified anxiety disorder, unspecified depressive \ndisorder, and functional neurologic disorder (previously referred to as conversion disorder \nin prior versions of the DSM). She noted that Applicant was compliant with medications \nprescribed by her physicians for anxiety and depression. Dr. B reported that Applicant \nhad not continued treatment with a psychiatrist or therapist, which contradicts Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony. Dr. B had concerns that Applicant could have a recurrence of conversion \nsymptoms due to her lack of ongoing treatment for anxiety and depression. She \nrecommended Applicant continue her psychiatric/psychological treatment, despite her \npsychological test results that indicated Applicant is not interested in doing so, and her \nhistory that documents her failure to adhere to treatment recommendations. \nConsequently, Dr. B stated that her prognosis is guarded. Applicant\u2019s history of psychotic \nepisodes leads Dr. B to be concerned about Applicant\u2019s reliability, judgment, stability, and \ntrustworthiness. Applicant testified that her meeting with Dr. B was through the Zoom \nplatform and lasted one hour. (Tr. 43-44; GE 4) \nMedical records show that in July 2021, Applicant met with Dr. T, a rheumatologist, \nfor follow-up treatment.

(Tr. 50-53, 141-142; AE-AR) When asked if Dr. T had diagnosed her, Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony was as follows: \n[Dr. T] suspected that it was autoimmune encephalopathy. And she also \nconsulted with a neurologist in the community because I had responded \nwith the high dose of steroids, that\u2019s always been her diagnosis has been \nautoimmune encephalopathy, steroid responsive. (Tr. 53) \nAt the bottom of the July 2021 medical report, Dr. T wrote a note dated March 31, 2022, \nwhich stated: \nI have sent this note for her MD to review as I have been informed of her \nadmission for mental health status changes.

She reached out again to Dr. D, and she is now seeing her every four to six weeks. \nApplicant testified that Dr. D strongly ruled out any type of conversion/functional \nneurological disorder as mentioned by Dr. B. Dr. D provided letters from August 2021 and \nOctober 2021, which specifically rule out a conversion disorder. In her October 2021 \nletter, Dr. D noted that she has been treating Applicant since June 2018 and she has \nfollowed all treatment recommendations. Based on her treatment of Applicant, she did \nnot have concerns regarding her reliability, judgment, stability, and trustworthiness and \ndid not have reservations recommending her for a security clearance. (Tr. 48-50, 136-\n141; AE W, AE X, AE-AQ, AE-AR) \nApplicant testified that a neurologist was consulted during her March 2022 hospital \nadmission about her diagnosis of autoimmune encephalopathy steroid-responsive. \nApplicant was discharged from the hospital on April 19, 2022. Applicant was treated with \nantipsychotics and Lorazepam.

Applicant testified that in April 2022 she was diagnosed with \nautoimmune encephalopathy that is steroid responsive. Applicant stated that she had not \nyet been diagnosed with autoimmune encephalopathy with steroid-responsive when she \nmet with Dr. B. (Tr. 38-44) \nDr. D provided another letter from May 2022. She confirmed that Applicant was \nadmitted to the VA hospital in March 2022 with altered mental status and was transferred \nto another hospital. She was treated with antipsychotics and Lorazepam for possible \ncatatonia. She was diagnosed with encephalopathy associated with autoimmune \nthyroiditis that responded to steroids. Dr. D expected Applicant to make a full recovery in \nthe next 9 to 12 months. She noted that the last episode Applicant had was three years \nago and it lasted 14 months. She said Applicant would be monitored and her medications \nadjusted accordingly. (AE Y) \nApplicant admitted that until July 2022 she was taking prescribed antipsychotic \ndrugs that were prescribed to her, presumably during her last admission to the hospital. \nShe explained that when she was admitted to the hospital in March 2022, she exhibited \nan altered mental status that presented as confusion, catatonic behavior, and emotionally \ndetached. She said neither Dr. T nor Dr. D had been consulted while she was admitted. \n(Tr. 73, 77) \nApplicant testified that the course of treatment for encephalopathy was determined \nto be immunosuppressant theory. In September 2022, she had not yet begun \nimmunosuppressant therapy to know if it is an effective treatment for her condition. There \nare four drugs potentially to treat her condition, and she began taking one in October \n2022. She continues to be on it and will need it or a similar drug for the rest of her life to \ncontrol her condition. (Tr. 143-146) \nDr. D provided an updated letter on January 11, 2023. She stated that Applicant \nwas successfully tapered off her antipsychotics and mood stabilizers. Her Lorazepam \ndaily dose has been decreased. She has followed up with her doctor for encephalopathy \nassociated with autoimmune thyroiditis that has successfully responded to steroids. She \nnoted Applicant\u2019s mental status examination is intact as well as her character, judgment, \nreliability, and integrity. The recommended treatment plan is for her to continue to take \nimmunosuppressive \nmedication, \nwhich \nwill \nhelp \nprevent \nrecurrence \nof \nthe \nencephalopathy. She should have a good prognosis if she continues to follow up as she \nhas done in the past. Dr. D had no reservations about recommending Applicant for a \nsecurity clearance. (Tr. 144; AE Z) \nDr. T provided a letter from January 2023. She said she has been taking care of \nApplicant since November 2018.

Dr. T has eliminated some \nmedications and is prescribing other medications for long-term care to prevent recurrence \nof the issues related to autoimmune encephalopathy. Dr. T and Applicant are working out \na strategy for a long-term treatment plan. She and her husband are aware of what to look \nout for if she begins experiencing symptoms that raise concerns that the encephalopathy \nis recurring. She noted that stress is a factor that triggers her symptoms and the \nautoimmune disorders. She acknowledges that she experienced anxiety and depressive \ndisorders in the past. She disagreed with Dr. B\u2019s diagnosis of conversion disorder. She \nunderstands that Dr. T is attempting to find the right dosage of medication for her \ncontinued treatment. She understands that this is an ongoing process. She explained that \nher symptoms are documented in her medical records, but there is no way she can say \ndefinitively that future problems will not recur. She does not think they will and trusts that \nthey will not, but she cannot say with certainty; however, she knows what to do if \nsymptoms recur. (Tr. 57-67; 147-151) \nAt the time of her hearing, Applicant had not yet been cleared to return to work by \nDr. D. Applicant testified that she did not have current symptoms of short-term memory \nloss or altered mental state. She anticipated seeing Dr. T or another specialist for the rest \nof her life. She also said she will continue to see Dr. D until she discharges her and will \nfollow her recommended treatment plan. Applicant is not on antipsychotic drugs at \npresent. She further testified that she has a medical diagnosis that has psychiatric \nsymptoms that she is being treated for. Although she was diagnosed with anxiety and \ndepression, she does not believe it affects her ability to perform her job. Since the doctors \nhave determined the underlying cause of her symptoms, she has noticed an improvement \nin her condition because she has a better understanding of her issues. (Tr. 57-67, 147-\n153) \nApplicant provided numerous character letters. Many of them were written before \nher most recent hospitalization in March 2022. She testified that she reached out to those \nproviding letters to make them aware of her hospitalization and inquired if any of them \nwanted to revoke their letters. None of them wanted to revoke their letters. She is \ndescribed as dynamic, confident, generous, thoughtful, composed, professional, fair, \nstrong, steady, resilient, determined, honorably, disciplined, honest, loyal, smart, \ntalented, positive, compassionate, patriotic, reliable, respected, trustworthy, and \nresponsible. She possesses technical, leadership and business-related skills. Her past \nwork performance is described as exceptional. She possesses a high level of trust and \nintegrity and a strong work ethic.

She was experiencing\nconfusion at the time.  \n \n \nOn March 30, 2022, Applicant was involuntarily hospitalized at the VA hospital. \nHer medical records noted that she had a history of present illness for depression, anxiety, \nSjogren\u2019s disorder, seizure disorder, hypothyroidism, PCOS (polycystic ovarian \nsyndrome) and neurogenic bladder. She was admitted to inpatient psychiatry for acute \npsychosis. She was placed in restraints due to disruptive behavior that posed a risk of \ninjury to herself and others. She was climbing on the windowsill, removing her hospital \nscrubs, pacing, banging on a chair and bedside table and unable to follow simple \ndirections. Later, she admitted to the medical staff that she had been bad, and she was \nresponsible for the use of restraints but was unable to give a coherent answer as to what \nshe meant but acknowledged there was a safety issue. She reported seeing things that \nwere not present in reality. The medical records reflect that there was concern from Dr. T \nthat her symptoms were the result of medical problems, and she was transferred to a \nmedical floor. Multiple doctors considered Dr. T\u2019s diagnosis of autoimmune \nencephalopathy and recommended further medical testing. A VA psychiatrist noted that \nApplicant was transferred to the medical floor for a workup for the medical etiology of \nsymptoms which was unrevealing. Other neurologists discussed the use of steroids on \npatients suspected of having immune mediated encephalopathy. Worsening psychosis \nwas discussed with the neurology team, and it was felt that a lumbar puncture should \nprecede a steroid trial. This procedure was declined by Applicant\u2019s family. The VA doctors \nconsidered Dr. T\u2019s diagnosis of autoimmune encephalopathy but none of the diagnostic \ntests confirmed abnormalities. She was treated with high dose steroids but the precise \ncause for her medical problems are unclear. (AE-AR) \nAccording to the medical records when Applicant was discharged from the VA \nhospital on April 9, 2022. Dr. P\u2019s diagnosis on discharge was acute psychosis. Tests had \nbeen performed with no acute findings. Dr. P noted that if there was a plausible diagnosis \nfor metabolic/autoimmune/Hashimoto\u2019s encephalopathy then he supported treatment \nwith high dose steroids, but he did not find either clinically or biochemically that Applicant \nhad encephalopathy. He recommended ancillary testing to formally diagnose Anti-N-\nmethyl D-aspartate (NMDC) encephalitis or to rule out an infectious source. He noted the \nfamily refused the procedure of lumbar puncture to make this determination, so neurology \nempirically treated her with high dose steroids for a working diagnosis of autoimmune \nencephalitis. (AE- AO, AE-AR) \n \nOn April 12, 2022, Applicant was again hospitalized.

(AE-AQ) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative interference concerning the standards in this guideline may be \nraised solely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 28, and the following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors; and \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and \n(d) failure to follow prescribed treatment plans related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication, or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \nThere is sufficient evidence that from approximately 2018 through 2022 Applicant \nexhibited emotional and mental conditions and behaviors as described in AG \u00b6 28(a). The \nevidence also includes an opinion by a qualified mental health professional that Applicant \nhas a condition that may impair her judgment, stability, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nShe has been hospitalized both voluntarily and involuntarily on several occasions since \n2017. AG \u00b6\u00b6 28(b) and 28(c) apply. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThere is evidence that doctors recommended for the purposes of proper diagnosis \nthat she have a lumbar puncture to determine if her issues are medical vice psychiatric. \nThe procedure was declined by her family. I am not convinced that her failure to have a \nlumbar puncture is a treatment plan related to a diagnosed psychological/psychiatric \ncondition. It was an invasive diagnostic procedure to determine whether she should be \ntreated with steroids. She was treated with steroids without the puncture. In addition, she \ndid not decide against the procedure; her family did. AG \u00b6 28(d) does not apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom psychological conditions. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29 were \nconsidered: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional;  \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation;  \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nApplicant has experienced mental health and medical problems since 2017. There \nis a conflict of opinions between the doctors who have treated her regarding the etiology \nof those problems. She has exhibited bizarre behaviors at times, which in turn cause \nserious concerns about her judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. At the time of her \nhearing, she had not yet been cleared to return to work due to her physicians\u2019 concerns \nabout the efficacy of new medications that she recently began taking. \nGiven the differing professional opinions as to the cause of Applicant\u2019s mental \nhealth and medical condition, and the fact that she has been on a new treatment regimen \nfor a relatively short period of time, I am unable to conclude that her condition is readily \ncontrollable and there has been ongoing and consistent compliance. AG \u00b6 29(a) does not \napply. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant obviously is searching for the cause of her problems and has been in \ntreatment with Dr. D since 2018 who has given her a favorable mental health prognosis. \nAlthough there is hope that her issues are amenable to treatment, it is too soon to \nconclude that definitively. AG \u00b6 29(b) has some application. However, based on Dr. B\u2019s \nmental health prognosis, AG \u00b6 29(c) does not apply. \nFrom 2017 to April 2022, Applicant was hospitalized several times for psychotic \nsymptoms, cognitive and memory issues, and other serious behavioral problems. Based \non her six-year psychiatric and medical history, I am unable to conclude at this time that \nApplicant\u2019s conditions were temporary, are resolved, and she no longer shows indications \nof emotional instability. AG \u00b6 29(d) does not apply. Applicant appears to be stable; \nhowever, I am unable to fully conclude at this time that there is no indication of a current \nproblem given her long history of struggling with medical and psychiatric issues. AG \u00b6 \n20(e) applies minimally. Despite some mitigating evidence, it is insufficient to overcome \nthe concerns raised. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline I in my whole-person analysis. \nIt is apparent that Applicant has been frustrated in her search for the causes of her \nmedical and mental health problems. Perhaps the professionals have found a path \nforward for her and after an extended period of stability she will be in a more positive \nposition. However, my duty is to provide a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision with \nthe protection of the national security as the paramount consideration. Any doubt must \nbe resolved in favor of the national security.

He enlisted in the Marine Corps in August \n1990. He served in Desert Storm, Desert Shield, Operation Restore Hope, 31st  Marine \nExpeditionary Unit (MEU) out of Okinawa, Japan, and on two sea service deployments \nthroughout Southwest Asia.

He retired with an \nhonorable discharge in July 2011 at the rank of staff sergeant. His decorations include \nthe Meritorious Service Medal, Navy Commendation Medal, and three Navy \nAchievement Medals. He has an extensive background in IT and various certifications. \nApplicant was married in 1994 and subsequently divorced in 2018. He has an adult \ndaughter, and a son, age 17. (Tr. 12-13, 23-25; GE 1, GE 2) \nApplicant was hired in February 2014 by a government contractor as an \noperations manager. One of his responsibilities was to ensure that the company\u2019s IT \noperations ran smoothly. He held a DOD security clearance in this position. Under \nGuideline M (Use of Information Technology), SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant, while \nemployed in this position and without the chief executive officer\u2019s (CEO) approval, \nobtained and utilized access to his employer\u2019s network drives, which contained the co-\nowners\u2019 personal information, as well as corporate sensitive information.

In about June 2014, he was granted system administrator \naccess in order to perform a network assessment. He admitted that with administrator \naccess he had admittance to the owners\u2019 personal information and any company \nproprietary information that was saved on any of the drives on the network. He denied \nthis allegation in his SOR Answer because he did not use or take any proprietary or \nsensitive information. Applicant also adamantly denied in his SOR Answer ever having \nsystem administrator access, which would have prevented him from doing some of the \nactivities alleged in the SOR.

Applicant was familiar with the person who worked for the \nsoftware company, but not the vendor who used the software. After the vendor \nperformed these services, Applicant admitted the CEO claimed that he had not been \ngiven authorization to have a vendor perform specific tasks during the network \nassessment. He stated that he had been clear during weekly work meetings of his intent \nto hire vendor A to access the company\u2019s network. He was present with the vendor the \nentire time they were on location performing these tasks. The vendor tested for \nvulnerabilities across the network and provided recommendations on how to harden the \nnetwork. He was not aware that he was supposed to obtain an NDA from the vendor \nsince he thought NDAs were only needed in business development. Applicant admitted \nhe used the system administrator status he was granted so the vendor could perform \nthese tests. He testified that he held the system administrator rights for about two weeks \nin June 2014. (Tr. 32-36, 50-52; GE 4) \nA government witness, Mr. Z, with 31 years of IT experience and who also \nprovided IT services to the federal contractor through his company, testified that a few \nweeks before Applicant resigned from his employment, Mr. Z was tasked with reviewing \nand monitoring the government contractor\u2019s network to determine if any company \ndocuments were lost or if any data was transferred from the company\u2019s network. Mr. Z \ntestified that he managed all the rights, permissions, and access to data on the \ncompany\u2019s network. He did not grant system administrator privileges to Applicant, but in \nMay 2014, he did grant vendor A full access through a temporary system administrator \naccount. Applicant was also able to have system administrator access via the temporary \naccount that was to be used only by the vendor. He stated that Applicant used the \ntemporary account access privileges from May 2014 until late September 2014, when \nan employee reported that Applicant had complete domain administrator privileges \nbecause Applicant had given him the account access password. Mr. Z testified that the \nsecurity manager immediately requested that he remove Applicant\u2019s access through the \ntemporary account created for the vendor. (Tr. 18, 97-99, 101-103, 105-107; GE 2, 4) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that on January 14, 2015, Applicant downloaded his \nemployer\u2019s proprietary information, sensitive personal information regarding the \nemployer\u2019s owners, and project data related to one or more government contracts.

He stated that he installed a Dropbox account due to employees having \ndifficulty obtaining information from the company drives. This Dropbox allowed project \nemployees access to information while there were at their customer worksites. The \ninformation he placed in the Dropbox was necessary for the employees to perform their \njob duties, and he said the Dropbox was in full compliance with IT rules and regulations. \nHe did not recall asking for permission to set up the Dropbox account but stated he had \nprovided notice during the weekly meetings that he was going to do so. He started \nmoving data into the Dropbox, which he claimed was a secure environment, using his \nwork e-mail. He worked out of the conference room on a regular basis and sometimes \nturned off the lights to take advantage of the natural lighting. As soon as the CEO found \nout that he had completed this task, she got extremely upset, and he immediately \ndeleted the information he had placed into the Dropbox. (Tr. 36-45, 62-64; GE 2) \nMr. Z testified that the night of January 14, 2015, just before Applicant departed \nfrom his employment, he was accessing files from the company\u2019s server at 4:20 p.m. \nThe forensic evidence showed that about 7 GB of data was transferred onto Applicant\u2019s \nlaptop in his Dropbox account. Mr. Z stated that the Dropbox was not a secure or proper \nway to handle the transference of sensitive information. The office video camera \nfootage showed that at 6:26 p.m., Applicant turned off the lights in the conference room \nwhile waiting for the data to migrate. At 7:04 p.m., Applicant deleted the Dropbox \ncontent from his laptop with encryption to prevent detection. Security video footage also \nshowed that Applicant then turned on the lights, activated the building\u2019s security alarm, \nand exited the building with his personal belongings in hand. Based on the forensic \nevidence found by Mr. Z during an examination of Applicant\u2019s work laptop, the CEO filed \nan incident report against Applicant. She accused Applicant of downloading company \nproprietary information and sensitive personal information concerning the owners of the \ncompany, and project data related to one or more government contracts that was \npossibly considered Controlled Technical Information. On this day, Applicant moved the \ndata into a personal Dropbox account on his work laptop using his personal email, and \nthen he deleted the trail from his laptop that same evening with the use of File Sanitizer, \nwhich was used to permanently delete files. Less than a week after this incident, \nApplicant submitted his letter of resignation to the company. The detailed analysis of \nforensic data recovered from Applicant\u2019s laptop was provided to the Defense Security \nService and the FBI. (Tr. 107-112; GE 2, 3, 4) \nDue to this incident, in April 2015, the security manager of the government \ncontractor contacted their customer on a government contract to self-report a security \nincident concerning their former employee. The security manager informed their \ncustomer that Applicant had downloaded sensitive information regarding the contract, \nand requested further direction from the customer.

He was not aware that porn sites were notorious for having \nviruses or malware. (Tr. 46, 77-78; GE 4) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges that Applicant \u201cenabled\u201d or tampered with \u201cHP Protect\u201d \nsecurity software on his laptop in violation of company policy. Applicant stated that he \ndid use HP Protect to wipe the work computer when he was departing his employment \nin February 2015, which he thought was an acceptable practice at most companies. He \ndenied installing HP Protect on his work computer because he believed it was already \npreloaded onto his work computer. He did not admit to wiping his computer clean on \nmore than one occasion, but he did admit he did so at the end of his employment. (Tr. \n36-45, 47-49; 62-64; GE 2, 4) \nMr. Z testified that wiping a computer clean is a red flag for IT professionals that \nsomeone is trying to hide something on their computer. Wiping a computer before \ndeparting a place of employment is also not a common practice within the industry. He \ntestified that a standard user should not have access to do a factory reset of the work \ncomputer unless they had administrator rights. When a laptop is returned by an \nemployee, all that is needed is to wipe out the user\u2019s profile. There is no need to initiate \na complete wipe of the computer. Mr. Z said that Applicant had completed a previous \nwipe to his work laptop in either July or August 2014, in addition to the wipe he \nperformed in February 2015, based on his forensic analysis. Mr. Z was able to recover \nmost of the deleted data on Applicant\u2019s laptop by using R-Studio, and other applications \nin his forensic examination. He determined that Applicant had been able to do many \nactivities that a standard IT user would not be able to do. (Tr. 108-117; GE 4) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges that Applicant created multiple usernames and passwords \nwithout IT or CEO permission in violation of company policy. Applicant stated this \nincident stemmed from the time he hired a vendor to perform system checks and \nvulnerabilities on the company\u2019s network. He created multiple usernames and \npasswords so that the system screenings could be performed. Another employee \nreported to the security manager in September 2014 that Applicant had given him the \nsystem administration password. The security manager contacted Mr. Z and requested \nthat Applicant\u2019s system administrator access be removed immediately. When Applicant \nwas questioned about this incident, he stated; \u201cI don\u2019t really understand the context, so \nit\u2019s hard for me to say.\u201d (Tr. 50-52; GE 4, 5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges that Applicant installed unauthorized software on his company \nlaptop in violation of company policy.

Applicant explained previously that the HP Protect \nsoftware was already preloaded on his work computer, but the IT provider, Mr. Z, \ntestified that he deleted all applications of HP Protect from all of the work laptops \nprovided to government contractor employees. When I specifically asked Applicant if he \nhad downloaded HP Protect, which was used to wipe his laptop, his response was; \u201cNo, \nnot that I'm aware of.\u201d He denied knowledge of the File Shredder on his laptop, and \nexplained that the Dropbox account was not software but was actually \u201ca link to go to \nthe internet\u201d in order to interface with an encrypted site, like a cloud. (Tr. 47, 52-54, 56-\n57; SOR Answer; GE 4) \nMr. Z testified that the federal contractor did not utilize Dropbox. He stated that \ngovernment contractors are not permitted to store any information on the cloud unless it \nis an approved government cloud, such as DOD SAFE, for instance. He also pointed \nout that if an employee needed Dropbox, they would use their work email address and \ncreate the account. Applicant did not use his work email address. Applicant used his \npersonal account when using Dropbox on his computer. Mr. Z stated that the analysis of \nthe Dropbox not only showed the contractor\u2019s data was stored there, but also showed \ndata Applicant had taken from a previous employer. Mr. Z stated, \u201cso, we see a pattern \nhere.\u201d (Tr. 117-122; GE 4) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleges that Applicant disabled or failed to run virus protection on his \nwork laptop, which resulted in malware virus infestation of his local profile. He denied \nthis allegation in his Answer and again during his testimony. When questioned about his \naccess to porn websites to view pornography, I asked Applicant whether it was common \nknowledge in the IT industry that many of these porn websites contained viruses or \nmalware. Applicant answered that he was not aware of this information. (Tr. 54-55, 77-\n78; SOR Answer; GE 4) \nMr. Z logged into Applicant\u2019s work laptop and discovered that there was not an \nactive virus defense application installed. A full scan of the computer revealed Trojan \nviruses and malware in the local profile used by Applicant. Mr. Z had to have the viruses \nand malware removed before a detailed analysis of Applicant\u2019s laptop could be \ncompleted. Mr. Z also noted that accessing pornographic websites could have \ncontributed to the viruses and malware on the laptop. (GE 4) \nApplicant departed employment with the federal contractor in February 2015 and \nstarted a franchise. He testified that the franchise did not interfere or overlap with the \nbusiness of his former employer. He operated the franchise for five years while he also \nworked concurrently as a sales director for another company. Since 2018, Applicant has \nserved as a vice president of his current company, and he is requesting a DOD security \nclearance be granted so he can perform specific job duties.

Applicant admitted this information in his \nAnswer. Instead of laying off the employee, he stated that the CEO wanted him to fire \nthe female employee for a dress code violation, specifically, for a skirt that was too \nshort. Applicant determined that this employee was not in violation of company policy \nand refused to fire the employee. A meeting followed, and the CEO again asked \nApplicant to fire the employee. Applicant stated that he refused because the female was \nnot his employee and because he believed that both owners of the company were also \nin violation of the dress code policy. Applicant denied that he had a close relationship \nwith this employee, but he did acknowledge she was hired to work for his franchise after \nhe left the government contractor. The CEO reported that Applicant was asked to lay off \nthe employee due to lack of contract work, and he refused.

(Tr. 82-93; AE F, G) \nApplicant also provided character-reference letters from a previous employee, \nsupervisor, and the president of the federal contractor that currently employs Applicant. \nThe general sense of the character evidence is that he is diligent, professional, \nproductive, reliable, and trustworthy. Applicant continues to provide important \ncontributions to warfighters\u2019 mission. His character statements support reinstatement of \nhis security clearance. (AE C, D, E) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 an \u201capplicant is responsible \nfor presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline K: Handling Protected Information, and Guideline M: Use of Information \nTechnology \nDue to the overlap in security concerns, disqualifying conditions, and mitigating \nconditions in the context of Applicant\u2019s conduct with IT systems and the handling of \nprotected information while employed by a government contractor, these two guidelines \nare discussed together, below. \nThe security concern under Guideline K is set out in AG \u00b6 33 as follows: \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for  handling\nprotected information which includes classified and other sensitive government\ninformation, and proprietary information raises doubt about an individual\u2019s\ntrustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability to safeguard\nsuch information, and is a serious security concern.    \n \n \n \n \nThe security concern under Guideline M relating to the use of information \ntechnology is set out in AG \u00b6 39: \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \nand information. Information Technology includes any computer-based, \nmobile, or wireless device used to create, store, access, process, \nmanipulate, protect, or move information.

The above disqualifying conditions under Guidelines \nK and M have been established. \nAG \u00b6 35 of Guideline K contains three mitigating conditions that have possible \napplicability to the facts of this case: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training or \nunclear instructions; and  \n(d) the violation was inadvertent, it was promptly reported, there is no \nevidence of compromise, and it does not suggest a pattern. \nThe following mitigating conditions under Guideline M, AG \u00b6 41 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n(b) the misuse was minor and done solely in the interest of organizational \nefficiency and effectiveness; \n(c) the conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a \nprompt, good-faith effort to correct the situation and by notification to \nappropriate personnel; and \n(d) the misuse was due to improper or inadequate training or unclear \ninstructions. \nThe Appeal Board gives deference to a company\u2019s findings and conclusions in its \nsecurity investigations. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, \n2018) (\u201c[B]ecause of the unique position of employers as actual administrators of \nclassified programs and the degree of knowledge possessed by them in any particular \ncase, their determinations and characterizations regarding security violations are \nentitled to considerable deference, and should not be discounted or contradicted without \na cogent explanation.\u201d). \nApplicant repeatedly denied in his SOR Answer that he had systems \nadministrator access to the company\u2019s network, and without this access, he would not \nhave had the ability to perform several of the alleged IT operations, such as \ndownloading, storing, or transmitting classified, sensitive, proprietary, or other protected \ninformation that he did not have authorization to access, or be able to install other \nsoftware. At the hearing, however, Applicant admitted he did have this access for about \ntwo weeks in June 2014, while he was working with vendor A to conduct an analysis of \nthe company\u2019s network. Mr. Z also testified that he had granted temporary complete \ndomain administrator rights access to be used by the vendor, but he was later notified \nthat Applicant had unauthorized access through this temporary account and Mr. Z was \ntasked with the immediate removal of his access in late September 2014. With the \ntemporary administrator account Applicant had access to everything on the company \nnetwork. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nApplicant has made inconsistent statements about him having access to system \nadministrative rights at his previous place of employment. He also stated that on \nJanuary 14, 2015, just before he gave the CEO his resignation letter, he was working to \nmove company data from the network to the Dropbox account. He claimed that he had \nset up an account under his work email, but Mr. Z stated the Dropbox account was \nactually Applicant\u2019s personal account. Applicant testified that when the CEO discovered \nthe Dropbox account and after she let him know she was upset, he immediately deleted \nthe data from the Dropbox account. However, the evidence showed that after Applicant \nhad migrated 7 GB of the company\u2019s data into the Dropbox account on January 14, \n2015, with the lights turned off, he then immediately deleted evidence of his activities \nbefore he left the work building. Understandably, an employee\u2019s downloading of a large \nnumber of files shortly before submitting his letter of resignation raises concerns. \nApplicant has extensive experience and knowledge in the IT field. I find that his actions \nthat day were highly suspicious. Mr. Z\u2019s analysis of Applicant\u2019s laptop gave evidence \nthat not only the company\u2019s data was discovered, but he also found proprietary data \nfrom Applicant\u2019s previous employer. The forensic evidence showed a pattern, and the \nemployer\u2019s conclusions from the investigative findings of this case is given deference. \nApplicant\u2019s total wipe of his work laptop is also concerning because it shows that \nhe was trying to hide his past activities. There were applications that had been \ndownloaded on the laptop that were not provided by the company. Mr. Z testified that it \nis not a common practice, as Applicant claimed, for an employee to do a total wipe of a \nlaptop before turning it into the IT manager. He noted that a regular user would not have \nbeen able to conduct a factory reset of the laptop either. Mr. Z stated that in the IT \nindustry, any individual who does a total wipe of their work computer immediately raises \na red flag that the user was trying to hide their past activities. The fact that Applicant \ncompleted a wipe of his work computer on two occasions during his one-year tenure \nwith the government contractor is troubling. \nApplicant could not recall whether he accessed pornography on his work laptop, \nbut he said that he would take responsibility for it. His statement that accessing \npornography on his work laptop generally was a bad idea, but he did not violate any \ncompany policy he was aware of (emphasis added), is just not credible and undercuts \nthe believability of his claim. His actions, and his continued denial of improper conduct \ndespite his former employer\u2019s conflicting forensic data, continues to demonstrate that he \nis not trustworthy or reliable. None of the mitigating conditions listed in AG \u00b6 35 and AG \n\u00b6 41 are applicable. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nprovide truthful and candid answers during national security investigative \nor adjudicative processes. \u2026 \nThe following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16 are potentially \napplicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative  issue  areas  that \nis  not sufficient for an  adverse determination  under any  single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment  of  questionable  judgment,  untrustworthiness, unreliability, \nlack of candor,  unwillingness to  comply with  rules and regulations, or \nother characteristics indicating that the individual may not properly \nsafeguard classified  or  sensitive information;  \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to: \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer\u2019s time or resources. \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing; and  \n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to \nthe employer as a condition of employment. \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline E that Applicant refused a direct order to lay \noff an employee while employed with the government contractor; while Applicant was \nthe sole administrator for his employer\u2019s LinkedIn account, he caused the employer\u2019s \npage to be changed and redirected visitors to his new company; and that Applicant told \nthe security manager in August 2014 that he already had all of the government \ncontractor\u2019s information. \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn addition, three of the SOR allegations under Guideline M were cross-alleged \nunder Guidelines K and E. Applicant\u2019s conduct could affect his personal and \nprofessional standing if it became known by his current or future employers and that fact \ncreates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by others. His violation of \nhis employer\u2019s IT protection policies violated the commitment he made when he \nbecame employed, which was a condition of his employment. The above disqualifying \nconditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are \npotentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;   \n(d) the individual acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nThe three individual SOR allegations under Guideline E; failure to follow direct \norder of the CEO to lay off an employee, his statement to the security officer that he \nalready had all of the company\u2019s data already, and the problems associated with the \ncompany\u2019s LinkedIn account were not sufficiently corroborated during the hearing or in \nthe evidence in the record. Applicant\u2019s explanations for these events were logical and \nreasoable. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a, 3.b, and 3.c are concluded for Applicant. \nThe central theme of this case is Applicant\u2019s violation of IT and company policies \nconcerning protected and sensitive data. These actions (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c) were \nalso alleged under this Guideline. His demeanor and testimony lacked credibility, and \nthe inconsistencies between his testimony and the other evidence in the record further \nundermined his credibility. His behavior could affect his personal, professional, and \ncommunity standing. His conduct is disqualifying under this guideline for the same \nreasons that it is disqualifying under Guidelines M and K, as discussed above. None of \nthe mitigating conditions apply. \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n        \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. This SOR highlights serious offenses that provide \ninsight to Applicant\u2019s character and integrity. Applicant is not remorseful for his \nmisconduct and some of his explanations are self-serving and implausable. He has \nestablished a pattern of unwillingness to follow rules, policies, and regulations. Despite \nthat this misconduct occurred several years ago, the grave seriousness of the matter \nand security implications remain. I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated security \nconcerns raised by his use of information technology, handling protected information, \nand personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline M: \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nParagraph 2, Guideline K: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a, b, and c: \nFor Applicant \n15 \n  AGAINST APPLICANT \n Against Applicant \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n                \n            \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

She planned to dispute the charges or settle the delinquent \naccounts for less than the full balance. (Item 3) \nDepartment Counsel made it clear in the Government\u2019s brief that Applicant had not \nprovided any evidentiary documentation to show what steps she had taken to resolve her \nsignificant delinquent debt. Applicant chose not to respond or submit documentation \nduring her 30-day period following the receipt of the Government\u2019s file of relevant \ninformation. \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.

Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nThe record evidence of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts and her admission establish \nthe following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem form a legitimate and credible, source such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis or provides evidence or actions to resolve \nthe issue. \nApplicant bears the burden of production and persuasion in mitigation. An \napplicant is not held to a standard of perfection in his or her debt-resolution efforts or \nrequired to be debt-free. \u201cRather, all that is required is that an applicant act responsibly \ngiven his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \n\u2018concomitant conduct,\u2019 that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the \nplan.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017). See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n13-00987 at 3, n. 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 14, 2014). \nApplicant \nattributed \nher \nfinancial \ndelinquencies \nto \nunderemployment. \nNotwithstanding this situation that adversely affected her finances, Applicant must \ndemonstrate that she acted responsibly under the circumstances. In June 2020, she \nadmitted during her background interview several of the debts that were alleged in the \nSOR. She did not mention the CARES Act when discussing the federal student loans she \nobtained to attend college. The CARES Act automatically put all federal loans into \nforbearance in March 2020. I find it is important to note that at that time her student loans \nwere placed into forbearance, they were over a year delinquent. In her Answer, she listed \nthat all four student loans were \u201cunknown\u201d by her. She also denied five other delinquent \naccounts in her Answer, without further explanation or submitting supporting records. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient information to mitigate the financial concerns in \nthis case. She did not provide any receipts or correspondence from her creditors, and she \ndid not provide documentation to validate her claim that she would either dispute the \ncharges or settle the delinquent accounts for less than the full balance. There is nothing \nin the record that shows she successfully disputed, settled, paid, or initiated payments on \nany of the delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR. Overall, I find that Applicant has not \ndemonstrated that she acted responsibly to address her financial delinquencies. She did \nnot provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the financial considerations security concern. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAccess to classified and protected information requires faithful adherence to the \nrules and regulations governing such activity. A person who fails to address concerns, \neven after having been placed on notice that his or her access or security clearance is in \njeopardy, may lack the willingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal \ninterests are at stake. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case, I conclude Applicant has not met her burden of \nproof and persuasion. At the present time, she did not mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concerns or establish her eligibility for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

He also stated that between 2015 and 2018, he smoked marijuana with his \nfriends about twice a year at social gatherings. He explained that after the state in \nwhich he resides legalized the use of marijuana in December 2018, he increased his \nmarijuana consumption to a couple of times a week at social gatherings. Applicant \nfurther stated that he has not used marijuana since November 2019. In response to \nwhether he intended to continue using marijuana, Applicant initially stated that he did \nnot intend to use marijuana again, but then qualified his response by stating that he did \nnot know if he could say that he would never use it again, outside of a rare social \ngathering, but doubted that he would use it again. (Government Exhibit 3.) \nIn January 2020, during Applicant\u2019s personal subject interview, Applicant told the \ninvestigator that he probably would use marijuana again since it was legal and socially \nacceptable in the state. Applicant further stated that he socializes and works with \npeople involved in the use of marijuana that is legal in his state but illegal Federally. \nApplicant listed a friend and coworker that he uses marijuana with as one of his \nreferences in his 2019 security clearance application. \nApplicant\u2019s step-father, who \nApplicant visits a few times a year, also uses marijuana. (Government Exhibit 6.) \nRegarding Applicant\u2019s use of hallucinogenic mushrooms in 2018 while holding a \nsecurity clearance, Applicant also told the investigator that his friend and co-worker \nreferenced above is the individual who provided him with the mushrooms and they used \nthem at the coworker\u2019s house. (Government Exhibit 6.) \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant stated that he understands that marijuana \npossession is a federal crime and he has no reservations about stopping his use of \nmarijuana as long as he has a security clearance.  (Government Exhibit 2.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains three conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);   \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and   \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. None of the conditions are applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were\nused; and  \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of the mitigating factors demonstrate full mitigation. Applicant is a 52-year\u00ad\nold, educated, software developer, with a military background, who has worked in the \ndefense industry for at least ten years and has held a security clearance for at least \neight years. He has used marijuana and hallucinogenic mushrooms while possessing a \nsecurity clearance, which is in violation of DoD policy and procedure. Furthermore, and \nmost troubling is the fact that Applicant is and has been for some time struggling to \ndetermine whether he will stop using marijuana or continue to use it despite the fact that \nit is illegal under Federal law. Applicant knows or should know that the use of illegal \ndrugs is prohibited by the Department of Defense. There is no exception to the rule or \nexcuse for Applicant\u2019s misconduct. His actions do not show the requisite maturity, good \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness necessary to be eligible for access to classified \ninformation. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. More time without drug use will show the \nGovernment that Applicant has matured and is sincere about his commitment to a drug-\nfree lifestyle. \nAt this time, Applicant has failed to provide sufficient evidence to \ndemonstrate that he meets the qualifications for a security clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nsecurity concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a: through 1.d. \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, Applicant did not \nmitigate personal conduct, handling protected information, and use of information \ntechnology concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information or to hold a sensitive \nposition is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 29, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \n(DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) \nto Applicant detailing reasons why under the personal conduct, handling protected \ninformation, and use of information technology guidelines the DoD could not make the \npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (Exec.

The case was assigned to me on April 23, 2022. A hearing was scheduled for \nDecember 19, 2022, and heard on the date as scheduled. At the hearing, the \nGovernment\u2019s case consisted of three exhibits and two hearing exhibits (HEs I-II) that \nwere admitted for administrative notice over Applicant\u2019s relevance objections. (GEs 1-3 \nand HEs I and II; Tr. 33). Applicant relied on one witness (herself) and no exhibits. The \ntranscript (Tr.) was received on January 3, 2023. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline E, Applicant allegedly was fired from her employment at a U.S. \nfederal court in August 2019 for accessing court records that she did not have \npermission to access and is ineligible for rehire. These Guideline E allegations are \ncross-alleged under Guidelines K and M for allegedly (a) violating her employer\u2019s \ncomputer usage policy by intentionally receiving sealed documents filed with her court \nemployer without authorization and (b) assessing sensitive documents outside of a \nbusiness need to know approximately 28 times while employed as a courtroom deputy \nclerk for a federal court. \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in the \nSOR with explanations and clarifications. She claimed that approximately 85 to 90% of \nfederal criminal cases in her federal district court involved either illegal entry or alien \nsmuggling. She also claimed that she accessed sealed files in the court out of curiosity \nover rarer cases in her court and never for personal gain or for the furtherance of an \nimproper purpose. She further claimed that she never knew nor currently knows a single \nperson named in any of the files and never transmitted, communicated, or sent to \nanyone, at any time, information included in the contents of the sealed files. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 48-year-old civilian of a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance. The admitted allegations are incorporated and adopted as relevant and \nmaterial findings. Additional findings follow. \nBackground \nApplicant never married and has three children from prior relationships, ages 24, \n15, and 14. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 18) She earned a high school diploma in May 1993 and a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2005. (GE 1-2) She reported no military service. \nSince October 2019, Applicant has been employed by her current defense \ncontractor as an administrative assistant.

(GEs 1-3; Tr. 14, 19-20, 27) \nFully briefed and aware of her employer\u2019s computer usage policy, Applicant \nintentionally accessed sealed documents digitally filed with her court employer without \nauthorization or need to know in or about July 2019. (GEs 1-3; Tr. 24-25) The court files \nshe accessed were sensitive documents covering ongoing criminal proceedings \ninvolving a highly dangerous local drug, racketeering, and murderous gang. (HEs I-II) \nApplicant accessed these documents 28 times while employer as a courtroom deputy \nclerk with neither authorization nor a demonstrated need to know. (GEs 1-3) Whether \nshe ever passed along information from the sealed files she accessed to unauthorized \nthird persons remains unproven from the received evidence. Applicant for her part \ndenied ever disclosing any of the contents of the sealed files she accessed to her friend \nof many years, and there is no evidence in the record to materially challenge and \ncontradict her. (Tr. 14) \nIn an interview conducted by the court\u2019s executive court clerk and Applicant\u2019s \noverall supervisor in August 2019, Applicant was informed that she violated the court\u2019s \ncomputer usage policy, as well as Canon 2 of the Code of Conduct for Judicial \nEmployees. (GE 3) During her meeting with the court\u2019s senior clerk, she and the court \nclerk discussed her accessing sealed documents filed with the court. (GE 3) \nAcknowledging that she accessed sealed documents involving a pending criminal case \ncovering a certain criminal defendant associated with a notorious drug trafficking, \nmurdering, and racketeering gang, she explained that she had done so \u201cout of curiosity\u201d \nbecause it was a big case in her community. (GE 3) \nAsked by the interviewing senior court clerk about her access frequency, she \nreplied that she could not recall.

(GE 3; Tr. 14) Asked further whether she had any friends \naffiliated with the gang, she replied that she had an undisclosed friend who gave birth to \na baby fathered by an identified member of the street gang. (GE 3; Tr. 28) \nUpon further investigation of the records covering the sealed files access \nincident, the court\u2019s senior clerk and his office documented 28 separate incidents of \nApplicant\u2019s accessing the sealed files covering the pending cases without authorization \nor demonstrated need to know. (GE 3) Accessing sealed court files without \nauthorization of demonstrated need to know constituted a direct violation of the court\u2019s \ncomputer usage policy. (GE 3) Applicant\u2019s awareness of the court\u2019s computer use policy \nis imputed to Applicant by virtue of her signing the court\u2019s computer use policy \nagreement acknowledging and confirming her responsibility to comply with the policy\u2019s \nrequirements.

(GE 3; Tr. 20, 23, 26, and\n30) Pressed further about her accessing court files in the pending street gang criminal\ncase, Applicant told the court clerk that while she had heard of the local street gang\nreferenced in the sealed files, she did not know any of the gang members.

Applicant\u2019s separation did \nnot include any reserved future eligibility for rehire consideration. \nIn her own hearing testimony, Applicant could not supply any more information \non her relationship with her friend and the latter\u2019s links to the local street gang member. \n(Tr. 30) Nor could she shed any further light about what intentions she harbored when \naccessing the sealed files in issue beyond curiosity over a heavily reported case in the \nmedia. (Tr. 16-18, 30-32) Applicant was at all times fully aware of the serious security \nconcerns posed by the street gang charged with murder, drug trafficking, and \nracketeering in the pending criminal proceeding in her community. (HE I) While she has \nnot maintained any Facebook or other contact with any of the 19 indicted street gang \nmembers referenced in the sealed files she accessed, she still maintains a friendship \nwith this friend who is linked to the local street gang member. (Tr. 28) \nIn her most recent personal subject interview (PSI) conducted in April 2020, \nApplicant expounded more on her breach of her court\u2019s computer use policy and \nensuing separation from federal service. (GE 2) In her PSI, she volunteered that she \nwas the only one involved in the sealed file incident and was not authorized to access \nthe sealed court files. \nShe assured the investigating agent that she had no reason to access the court \nfiles other than her harboring curiosity about the highly publicized case. (GE 2) She \nfurther assured the investigator that she had learned her lesson and is now better \ninformed of what she is allowed and not allowed to do. (GE 2) Applicant\u2019s curiosity \nassurances cannot be inferentially reconciled with her friendship with the friend in a \nparenting relationship with one of the gang members or with the number of times (28) \nshe accessed the sealed files in issue. \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court in \nDepartment of the Navy v.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These AG guidelines take into account factors that \ncould create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. The AG guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent\nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                            Personal Conduct \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n                                    Handling Protected Information \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n                                   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n                                                Burdens of Proof \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulation \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, and trustworthiness, \nand ability to protect classified or sensitive information. Of special \ninterest is any failure to cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers \nduring national security investigative or adjudicative processes . . . AG \n\u00b6 15. \nThe Concern. Deliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and \nregulations for handling protected information-which includes classified \nand other sensitive government information, and proprietary information-\nraises doubt about and individual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, \nor willingness and ability to safeguard such information, and is a serious \nsecurity concern. . . . AG \u00b6 33. \nUse of Information Technology \nThe Concern. Failure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or \nregulations pertaining to information technology systems may raise \nsecurity concerns about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, \ncalling into question the willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive \nsystems, networks, and information. Information Technology includes \nany computer-based, mobile, or wireless device used to create, store, \naccess, process, manipulate, protect, or move information. This includes \nany component, whether integrated into a larger system, or not, such as \nhardware, software, or firmware used to enable or facilitate these \noperations.  . . . AG \u00b6 40. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec.

Applicant\u2019s breaches are still \ntoo recent to facilitate safe predictions of recurrence avoidance in the foreseeable \nfuture. \nWhile this is not a close case, even close cases must be resolved in the favor of \nthe national security. See Dept. of Navy v. Egan, supra. Quite apart from any required \nadherence to rules and regulations the Government may impose on the clearance \nholder employed by a defense contractor, the Government has the right to expect \nhonesty and good judgment from the trust relationship it has with the clearance holder. \nSee Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507, 511n.6 (1980) \nWhole-person assessment \nFrom a whole-person perspective, Applicant has failed to establish enough \nindependent probative evidence of her overall honesty, trustworthiness, maturity and \ngood judgment required of those who seek eligibility to hold a security clearance or \nsensitive position. At this time, she lacks enough positive reinforcements and time in a \ntrust position to facilitate safe predictions of she is at no risk of recurrence. \nConsidering the record as a whole at this time, and granting due weight to the \nacknowledgements made by Applicant of her past trust breaches and steps she is \ntaking to avoid any recurrences, there is insufficient probative evidence of sustainable \nmitigation in the record to make safe predictable judgments about Applicant\u2019s ability to \navert trust breaches in the future when tasked with responsibility for protecting sensitive \n8 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n      \n       \n                            \n  \n \n               \n                                                        \n \n \n       \n \n \n               \n                                            \n \n      \n \n \n               \n                                                     \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nand classified information.

(AX B.) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.j: student loans placed for collection by the Department of \nEducation totaling about $64,900. These loans were placed for collection in 2018. (GX \n3 at 2-4.)

He did not \npresent any evidence of payments or a payment agreement. \nSOR \u00b6 1.p: medical debt placed for collection of $193. This debt was placed \nfor collection in March 2017. (GX 4 at 20.) Applicant paid it on January 23, 2023. (AX F.) \nApplicant testified that the student loans were in forbearance for a while, but he \ndid not know when the forbearance ended. He was not sure whether he made any \npayments before the forbearance. (Tr. 19-22.) He did not remember the amounts of any \npayments that he made. (Tr. 25.) As of the date of the hearing, he did not know the status \nof the private student loans. (Tr. 26.) \nApplicant\u2019s annual income is about $56,000. His spouse earns about $38,000 per \nyear. (Tr. 39-40.) He has nominal savings but has a retirement account of about $90,000. \nHe testified that he and his spouse live paycheck to paycheck. (Tr. 43.) Default judgments \nfor unpaid rent on his home were entered against him in March 2021 and January 2022. \n(GX 5 at 3-6.) These judgments are not alleged in the SOR. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s bankruptcy in March 2001 and the default judgments for unpaid rent \nwere not alleged in the SOR. Conduct not alleged in the SOR may be considered to \nassess an applicant's credibility; to evaluate an applicant's evidence of extenuation, \nmitigation, or changed circumstances; to consider whether an applicant has \ndemonstrated successful rehabilitation; to decide whether a particular provision of the \nAdjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or to provide evidence for whole person analysis \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). I have considered the bankruptcy \nand judgments for unpaid rent for these limited purposes. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at and after the hearing \nestablish two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy \ndebts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following \nmitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n . \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant submitted no evidence of conditions \nlargely beyond his control. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant submitted no evidence of financial \ncounseling. He has hired a company to assist him in consolidating his student loans and \nnegotiating a payment plan, but he had not made the initial payment to the company. \nFurthermore, the company does not provide the type of financial counseling contemplated \nby this mitigating condition. He submitted no evidence of financial counseling. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant submitted evidence of three $50 payments \non student loans in 2020. He submitted evidence of a payment on one debt not alleged \nin the SOR, but he did not make that payment until after the hearing. He took no action \nto resolve the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.o, and 1.p until after the hearing. An \napplicant who waits until his clearance is in jeopardy before resolving debts may be \nlacking in the judgment expected of those with access to classified information. ISCR \nCase No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018) citing ISCR Case No. 15-03208 at 5 (App. \nBd. Mar. 7, 2017). \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant has not disputed any of the debts alleged \nin the SOR. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant was sincere and candid at the \nhearing, but it was apparent that he little understanding of his financial situation and no \nclear plan to address his delinquent debts. He has a long history of financial problems \nand no clear plan to attain financial stability. I am not confident that he will not revert to \nhis pattern of neglecting financial responsibilities if he is relieved of the pressure to keep \nhis security clearance. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.p: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(Tr. 40) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . ..\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine \nadjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18) Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt triggers the application of AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability \nto satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were not caused by foolish or profligate \noverspending. Instead, they occurred when one of his children began experiencing \nserious medical problems that required costly treatment. Applicant addressed his financial \nproblems by decreasing expenditures through selling his home and moving to a cheaper \nhome, and through increasing income by taking on two part-time jobs. I conclude AG \u00b6 \n20(b) applies. \nApplicant\u2019s student loans were forgiven through the public service loan forgiveness \nprogram, he satisfied the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.a, and he is working on a plan \nto pay down the remaining SOR debts. Consequently, AG \u00b6 20(d) applies. \nThe overwhelming majority of Applicant\u2019s debts were student loan accounts. \nBecause Applicant has earned his college degree and his finances are stabilized, it is \nunlikely that he will incur delinquent student loan debts in the future. Moreover, the \nnominal amount of the remaining outstanding debts does not cast doubt on his current \nreliability and trustworthiness. In sum, there are clear indications that Applicant\u2019s financial \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nproblems are under control.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, age 41, is unmarried without children. He received his high school diploma in 1999. He received a network information systems certification in 2000. He attended college from 2003 through 2005 and in 2014 without earning a degree. He previously held a secret clearance while employed by defense contractors from August 2002 until it was deactivated in May 2012, due to a loss of jurisdiction involving a layoff in April 2012. He remained unemployed until November 2013. He has been employed in the same information technology position by two different defense contractors since June 2018. The secret clearance he was granted in June 2018 was sponsored by a prior employer for whom he did not end up working.

The 2011 eQIP was submitted during a period when Applicant previously held a \nsecret clearance. He was granted a secret clearance in June 2018 in connection with the \n2017 eQIP.

In his Answer, Applicant admitted, in part, and denied, in \npart, the Guideline H allegations. He did not respond to the Guideline J allegation in his \nAnswer, which I construed as a denial. Based on Applicant\u2019s admissions, his testimony, \nand the evidentiary record, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant smoked marijuana in joint form, with varying frequency, from 1990 \nthrough 2012. He consumed marijuana in an edible form one time in 2013 while \nunemployed. He was criminally charged with possession of marijuana in 2008, 2009, May \n2011, December 2011, and 2018.

(GE 1, 2, 4, 5, 6; Tr.) \nIn September 2008, while driving home from a gun shooting range, a police officer \npulled Applicant\u2019s vehicle over for a missing license plate. After smelling marijuana \nemanating from the vehicle, the police officer initiated a search of the vehicle. During the \nsearch, the officer found a handgun under the passenger\u2019s seat. The handgun, which was \nregistered to Applicant, was loaded. Applicant forgot to unload it and place it in the trunk \nafter leaving the range. The officer also found marijuana inside a bookbag located on the \nback seat. Applicant was arrested and held in custody for three to four hours before being \nreleased. (GE 1; GE 2 at 4, 13; GE 4; GE 5 at 3-4; GE 6) \nApplicant was initially charged with (1) felony possession of marijuana with intent \nto distribute, (2) misdemeanor possession of marijuana, and (3) misdemeanor \ntransporting a handgun in a vehicle. At some point, charge (3) was amended to \nmisdemeanor transporting, wearing, or carrying a handgun. Charge (1) was nolle \nprosequi in October 2008. In March 2009, charge (2) was nolle prosequi and he was \nfound guilty of charge (3), as amended. In October 2009, he was sentenced to serve an \nunspecified number of days in jail over five consecutive weekends and supervised \nprobation for one year. Applicant asserted that his sentence was shortened to three \nweekends and that his probation was also shortened by about six months. (AE A at 1-3; \nAE B; GE 2 at 4, 13; GE 3; GE 5 at 4; Answer; Tr. at 56, 59, 122) \nIn his 2011 eQIP, Applicant stated, \u201cI have learned my lesson,\u201d in response to \nquestions about this offense. In his 2017 and 2019 eQIPs, he repeated: \nI was young and immature. This was a mistake and I have learned my \nlesson. I recognize my failures and shortcoming\u2019s [sic]. This does not define \nwho I am as a person or professional. I have goals and want to be \nsuccessful.

(Tr. at 151) \n2009 Charge \nIn March 2009, while Applicant was driving home from work, a police officer pulled \nhis vehicle over for an inoperable taillight. After smelling the odor of marijuana emanating \nfrom the vehicle, the officer initiated a search of the vehicle. During the search, the officer \nfound what Applicant described as a marijuana joint in the ashtray. Applicant was not \narrested, but he was issued a summons to appear in court.

A court record \nindicates that he pled guilty at a July 1, 2009 court appearance, during which he received \na deferred disposition to July 6, 2010, pending his completion of a drug treatment \nprogram, 100 hours of community service, and payment of a $250 fine. He voluntarily \nperformed an additional seven hours of community service for a total of 107 hours in \nJanuary 2010. He completed the drug program in February 2010. (GE 3; Answer; AE A \nat 5-6, 13-14; AE B) \nApplicant described the drug program as an outpatient class where he was \nsubjected to urinalysis testing. He attended group classes once or twice per week where \nhe was educated about drugs and the pitfalls of drug use. He completed the program in \na manner sufficient to satisfy his obligation to the court. Although he did not stop using \nmarijuana immediately following his completion from the program, he asserted that he \nbegan having better judgment and becoming more reliable based on what he learned \nfrom the program. About two to three months later, he stopped using marijuana because \nhe wanted to better his life. (GE 2 at 4; Tr. at 65) \nIn his 2011 eQIP, Applicant stated, \u201cI was immature and having fun, I have learned \nmy lesson,\u201d in response to questions about this offense. In his 2017 and 2019 eQIPs, he \nrepeated, \u201cI am drug free and more mature.\u201d At the hearing, he asserted that the \nmarijuana belonged to a \u201ccoworker of mine.\u201d (Tr. at 151; GE 1, 4, 6) He also maintained \nthat he had not used marijuana on the day he was arrested. (Tr. at 66). \nMay 2011 Charge \nIn May 2011, Applicant smoked marijuana, in an amount he described as half a \njoint, while sitting alone and listening to the radio inside his parked vehicle in a park. At \nsome point, he fell asleep and was awakened by park police officers pulling on his \nvehicle\u2019s door handles. In response, Applicant rolled down the window of his vehicle to \nspeak with the officers. After observing Applicant put something in his mouth believed to \nbe drugs, one of the officers tried to open Applicant\u2019s mouth. In response, he bit the \nofficer\u2019s finger. He was arrested and held in custody for two to three hours before being \nreleased. (GE 1; GE 2 at 3, 12-13; GE 4; GE 5 at 3; GE 6; Tr. at 68, 69) \nApplicant was charged with (1) misdemeanor assault on a police officer, (2) \nmisdemeanor possession of marijuana, and (3) misdemeanor possession of marijuana \nparaphernalia. In July 2011, he pled guilty to charge (2) for which he was sentenced to \nserve one day in jail and fined $50. The disposition of charges (1) and (3) was not \nindicated in the documentary evidence. However, he asserted that the officer agreed to \ndrop charge (1) on the basis that there had been a miscommunication and \nmisunderstanding of his rights. During a January 2018 security clearance interview (SI), \nApplicant admitted that the officers found marijuana in the vehicle. However, during \nsubsequent SIs in March and October 2019 and in his Answer, he maintained that the \nofficers did not find any marijuana. Applicant did not address charge (3).

(GE 2 at 3; Tr. at 69) He maintained that he did \nnot bite the officer\u2019s finger on purpose. (Tr. at 69) In his 2011 eQIP, Applicant stated, \u201cThis \nlifestyle is behind me and I have grown up,\u201d in response to questions about this offense. \nIn his 2017 and 2019 eQIPs, repeated:  \nI have been drug free for 5 years and much more mature; I understand and \nlearned from my failures, shortcomings, and bad experiences. This \noccurrence does not define who I am as a person or professional. (GE 1, 4, \n6)  \nAt the hearing, after initially denying that he smoked marijuana the day he was \narrested, Applicant admitted that he had, in fact, smoked marijuana that day. However, \nhe denied that he was either smoking marijuana or in possession of marijuana in the \nvehicle at the time of his arrest. He explained: \nOkay, so they never caught me with possession of marijuana, but then when \nI went to the holding cell, they asked me to make a statement, and basically \nI made this statement, you know, saying that I had marijuana, and they said \nif I made that statement, that they was [sic] going to make everything go \naway or they was [sic] going to drop all charges. So, the only reason why I \nagreed to possession of marijuana, because they said they was [sic] going \nto drop the assault charges and the possession of marijuana charges. (Tr. \nat 70, 73, 77, 94-95, 153) \nLater during his testimony, Applicant claimed that the police report indicating that \nthe smell of marijuana was emanating from Applicant\u2019s person was incorrect because, \ncontrary to his previous admission during an October 2019 SI, he had not smoked \nmarijuana in the vehicle. In response to a question about where he smoked the marijuana, \nhe asserted \u201c[i]t was after work so after work outside.\u201d He denied that a marijuana smell \nwas emanating from his person by the time the officers approached him because he had \nsmoked the marijuana \u201cprobably like three hours, four hours\u201d prior. (Tr. at 84, 153-155; \nGE 2 at 3) \nDecember 2011 Charge \nIn December 2011, a police officer pulled Applicant\u2019s vehicle over after observing \nhim make an illegal U-turn at a red light. Due to smelling the odor of marijuana emanating \nfrom the vehicle, the officer initiated a search of the vehicle. Applicant was arrested after \nthe officer found a small bag of marijuana in the vehicle, in an amount Applicant described \nas equivalent to a joint.

When the officer pulled his vehicle over for a traffic stop, \nApplicant immediately jumped out of the vehicle and began to reach back into the vehicle \nout of the officer\u2019s line of sight. The officer then ordered Applicant to step away from the \nvehicle and to take his hands out of his pockets. During a pat down, the officer detected \na strong odor of marijuana emanating from Applicant\u2019s person, at which time Applicant \nadmitted to the officer that he had just smoked marijuana. The officer also detected the \nodor of burnt marijuana emanating from inside the vehicle. During a search of the vehicle, \nthe officer located a grocery bag inside an open backpack containing a clear Ziplock bag \nof marijuana. Also located inside the backpack was a small container of marijuana, a \ndigital scale, $113 in cash, and two empty clear plastic baggies. The marijuana had a total \nweight of 22.1 grams and a street value of $440. Because the officer deemed the \npresence of these items to be indicators of possession of marijuana with the intent to \ndistribute it, he arrested Applicant and transported him to be charged. (GE 7) \nApplicant was charged with (1) misdemeanor possession of 10 or more grams of \nmarijuana and (2) felony possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.

He also denied that he smelled of marijuana at the time of his arrest or that he \nhad smoked marijuana that day.

One of those \nreferences, a friend and former coworker, stated, \u201cI have never witnessed [Applicant] with \ndrugs or associated with any criminal activity.\u201d Applicant acknowledged that none of his \nreferences knew about his criminal arrests and convictions or his marijuana use. At some \npoint, he received a five-year service award for delivering outstanding customer service \nwhile employed by a defense contractor for whom he was employed between 2002 and \n2011.

(Tr. at 7-14) \nAt the end of the hearing, Applicant asserted that each occasion of his involvement \nwith law enforcement resulted from profiling. He explained, \u201cI mean, all the times I got \npulled over is, as you can say, I feel like I was being profiled or they was [sic] looking for \nsomething and then that escalated to another thing.\u201d (Tr. at 165) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan at 531). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d \nis \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington Metro. Area \nTransit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a nexus or \nrational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and \nan applicant\u2019s security suitability. (ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2016)). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case \nNo. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \nApplicant\u2019s use and possession of marijuana and marijuana-related criminal \ncharges establish the following disqualifying conditions set forth in AG \u00b6 25 under this \nguideline: \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nHaving considered all the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 26 that could mitigate the \nconcern under this guideline, I find the following warrant further discussion: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use spanned 23 years, from 1990 through at least 2013, \nincluding at times when he possessed a security clearance. His involvement with \nmarijuana extended through his most recent criminal charge in 2018. These facts alone \nunderscore a pattern of questionable judgment that casts doubt on his ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. The inconsistencies over details \nabout his marijuana use at various stages of the security clearance process damaged his \ncredibility and further undermined mitigation. \nI question the frequency of the marijuana use that Applicant self-reported, \nparticularly given his selective admissions to marijuana use at times that happened to \ncoincide with his involvement with law enforcement. He may very well have been profiled \nduring the various traffic stops as he asserted. However, in each instance, he was found \nto be in violation of a law for which he was ultimately convicted. Moreover, I was \nunpersuaded by his arguments claiming that police records did not accurately reflect his \nversion of events. \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGiven the environment in which Applicant was raised and still lives, it is reasonable \nto assume that he will continue to encounter drug use and drug users. During the hearing, \nApplicant appeared resolute regarding his intent not to resume using marijuana and his \nefforts to disassociate himself, to the extent possible, from those actively using drugs in \nhis presence. However, his lack of candor and failure to fully accept responsibility for his \nmarijuana involvement throughout the security clearance process raises doubts about his \ncommitment to abstinence. Moreover, his failure to provide a signed statement of intent \nto abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse cuts against mitigation. \nHaving had an opportunity to evaluate Applicant\u2019s demeanor and credibility at hearing, I \nhave substantial doubts about his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. Neither AG \u00b6 \n26(a), 26(b), nor 26(d) were established. \nGuideline J:  Criminal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: Criminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana-related criminal charges establish the following disqualifying \nconditions set forth in AG \u00b6 31 under this guideline: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nHaving considered all the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 32 that could mitigate the \nconcern under this guideline, I find the following warrant further discussion: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited\nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution,\ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher\neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity\ninvolvement. \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was convicted of misdemeanor possession of marijuana charges in \n2009, May 2011, and December 2011, and 2018.

Incorporating my analysis under Guideline H, and given \nlingering concerns about his credibility, there has not been a passage of time sufficient to \nconclude that his criminal conduct is unlikely to recur. Neither AG \u00b6 32(a) nor 32(d) were \nestablished. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, an administrative judge \nshould consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H and J in my whole-person \nanalysis and considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After having an opportunity to observe \nApplicant\u2019s demeanor during the hearing and considering his inconsistent statements \nwithin the record, I did not find his testimony credible. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guidelines H and J, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant did not mitigate the drug \ninvolvement and criminal conduct security concerns. Accordingly, Applicant has not \ncarried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nhim eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f: Against Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \n16 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(GE 1) Between 2010 and May 2020, Applicant completed his undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate studies at a prestigious university in State 1. During the course of his education, he recreationally used illegal drugs. Applicant used marijuana a few times per month. He also purchased the drug on a few dozen occasions to include purchasing the drug at dispensaries in states where doing so was legal. He used hallucinogenic mushrooms and LSD on four occasions each. He also admitted purchasing these drugs. He used cocaine three times. Most of Applicant\u2019s drug use occurred in social settings such as music festivals and camping trips with friends.

(GE 1) \nBetween 2010 and May 2020, Applicant completed his undergraduate, graduate, \nand post-graduate studies at a prestigious university in State 1. During the course of his \neducation, he recreationally used illegal drugs. Applicant used marijuana a few times per \nmonth. He also purchased the drug on a few dozen occasions to include purchasing the \ndrug at dispensaries in states where doing so was legal. He used hallucinogenic \nmushrooms and LSD on four occasions each. He also admitted purchasing these drugs. \nHe used cocaine three times. Most of Applicant\u2019s drug use occurred in social settings \nsuch as music festivals and camping trips with friends. Occasionally, he would use \nmarijuana alone. He also used Adderall without a prescription at least 10 times during his \neducation to help him focus, so that he could meet strict deadlines, including preparing \nhis dissertation defense. (Tr. 21, 24-25, 28, 31-39, 60; GE 1) \nIn June 2019, Applicant, who is also a musician, was traveling with his band when \ntheir van was stopped in State 2 as part of drug interdiction stop. He voluntarily told the \nofficer about the THC cartridge in his bag. Applicant received a citation. He was placed \nin a pre-trial diversion program in November 2019. After completion of the program, the \ncharges were dismissed in May 2020. Applicant had the charges expunged from his \nrecord in June 2020. (Tr. 40-42, 61-68, 74; AE A-C) \nInitially, Applicant envisioned a career in academia. However, as he came to the \nend of his post-graduate studies, he started exploring options in private industry. In doing \nso, he realized that any employment in his area of study would require a pre-employment \ndrug test. He also realized that future illegal drug use would be incompatible with such a \ncareer path. In May 2020, as he completed his doctorate, he decided to stop using illegal \ndrugs. He informed his wife and friends of his decision.

(Tr. 26-27, \n51, 70-73, 76) \nAs evidence of his commitment to abstain from illegal drug use, Applicant attended \na 16-hour drug and alcohol awareness class. He voluntarily submitted to four urinalysis \ntests between June 2021 and September 2022, all of which were negative for illegal drug \nuse. He also signed a statement of intent to abstain from future use of illegal drugs, \nagreeing to automatic revocation of security clearance eligibility in the case of future use. \nApplicant\u2019s current job also has a random urinalysis program. (Tr. 43-47, 74; AE D-F) \nNow married, Applicant focuses his attention on projects around the home he owns \nwith his wife. He occasionally performs as a musician. As a working professional, the \nmotivation to use Adderall to focus no longer exists. As a student, he was required to \ncomplete all his work on his own. Now, he has a team of coworkers and managers to ask \nfor help and support when needed. (Tr. 30) \nApplicant provided eight character letters from family, friends, and professional \ncontacts. Both Applicant\u2019s wife and his close friend attest that he has not used drugs since \n2020. Both also attest to his intention to abstain from illegal drug use in the future. A \nprofessor with whom Applicant worked for as a research assistant discussed Applicant\u2019s \nwork on a research project funded by DOD. He described Applicant as being \u201chonest, \nethical, and extremely dependable with respect to entrusted responsibilities.\u201d These \nsentiments were echoed by Applicant\u2019s long-time friends and family members who also \nwrote letters on his behalf. (AE G) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nThe SOR alleges disqualifying conduct under the drug involvement and substance \nmisuse guideline and the criminal conduct guideline. The government has established a \nprima facie case. \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe illegal use of controlled substances . . . that cause physical or mental \nimpairment . . . raises questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both \nbecause such behavior may lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it \nraises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. (See AG \u00b6 24). \nApplicant, admits to a history of illegal drug use and purchase, as well as \nprescription drug misuse between 2009 and May 2020. The following disqualifying \nconditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse; and, \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant submitted sufficient evidence to mitigate the alleged concerns. His last \nuse occurred over three years ago. His illegal drug use was recreational and mostly took \nplace in social settings. The concerns that motivated his misuse of prescription drugs are \nno longer present and he has better support in place to address any feeling of stress or \noverwhelm. Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use, while extensive, is not indicative of a substance \nabuse problem, and does not reflect on his current security worthiness. \nFurthermore, Applicant\u2019s drug use took place during his time as a student. As he \ntransitioned from academia to private industry, Applicant determined that future drug use \nwas not compatible with being a working professional. Although he still has friends that \ncontinue to use illegal drugs, he has clearly communicated his intent not to use illegal \ndrug and they no longer use drugs in his presence. Applicant has also voluntarily provided \na signed statement of intent to abstain from future illegal drug use to the Government. His \npromise not to use in the future is credible, given his change in circumstances. The \nfollowing mitigating conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or reliability; \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26 (b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and, \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of nation security \neligibility. \nCriminal Conduct \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability and willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations. The SOR alleges that Applicant was arrested \nin June 2019 and charged with possession of marijuana. However, this is incorrect. \nApplicant was not arrested but given a citation to appear in court on a charge of marijuana \npossession. He was ordered to complete a pre-trial diversion program. The following \ndisqualifying condition applies: \nAG \u00b6 31(b) evidence (including but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nindividual was formally charged, prosecuted, or trustworthiness. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 32(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 32(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time, without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nApplicant citations occurred four years ago. He completed the terms of a pre-trial \ndiversion program, the charges were dismissed, and have been expunged from his \nrecord. Because he has decided to abstain from future drug use, it is unlikely that \nApplicant will engage in similar criminal conduct again. \nBased on the record, I have no doubts regarding Applicant\u2019s ongoing security \nworthiness. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-person factors \nlisted in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant acknowledges his poor judgment in deciding to use illegal \ndrugs. It is not the purpose of a security clearance case to punish or sanction a person \nfor their past actions. Rather, it is a predictive risk assessment based on the past conduct. \nHe is aware of the prohibition against such use as a clearance holder. By providing full, \nfrank, and honest disclosure about his history of illegal drug use, and prescription misuse, \nApplicant has shown that he is likely to self-report adverse information even when doing \nso may be against his personal, professional, and financial interests. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Drug Involvement and  \nSubstance Misuse: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Criminal Conduct: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented in this case, it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.i and denied SOR \u00b6 1.j. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 39 years old. He served honorably in the United States Marine Corps from April 2010 until May 2018. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2017, and is working towards his master\u2019s degree. In his SCA he listed being married and divorced three times and had no children. (Item 3 at 30-33.) In his response to the Government\u2019s FORM he noted he was married to a \u201cstay-at-home mother, with two boys\u2026and one girl\u2026.\u201d Since May 2018, he has worked as a systems engineer for a defense contractor. He submitted a character statement of his colleague and supervisor a military veteran, with whom he has worked with for over two years. (AE13.) He was granted a security clearance in 2009 and again in 2020. Applicant\u2019s ten delinquent debts total $33,862. The debts are established by his SCA and multiple credit reports. (FORM Items 3-6.) The specific debts in the SOR are as follows: 2 SOR \u00b6 1.a: past-due account charged-off for $3,109. FORM Item 4 shows the status of the debt as closed and the last payment date as March 2019.

The PSI summary was not authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.20. Department Counsel informed Applicant the ESI was being provided to the \nAdministrative Judge for consideration as part of the record evidence in this case, and he \nwas entitled to comment on the accuracy of the PSI; make any corrections, additions, \ndeletions, and updates necessary to make the summary clear and accurate; object on the \nground that the report is unauthenticated. I conclude that Applicant waived any objections \nto the PSI summary by failing to respond to the FORM. \u201cAlthough pro se applicants are \nnot expected to act like lawyers, they are expected to take timely and reasonable steps \nto protect their rights under the Directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12010810 at 2 (App. Bd.

In his SCA he listed being married and divorced three times \nand had no children. (Item 3 at 30-33.) In his response to the Government\u2019s FORM he \nnoted he was married to a \u201cstay-at-home mother, with two boys\u2026and one girl\u2026.\u201d Since \nMay 2018, he has worked as a systems engineer for a defense contractor.

He offered that he had \nreceived financial counseling while on active duty and would be seeking financial \ncounseling through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant's admissions and the documentary evidence in the FORM establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy \ndebts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are relevant: \n(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is partially established. Applicant's delinquent debts occurred under \nsuch circumstances that they are unlikely to recur, a military deployment and a motor \ncycle accident, but they are recent, numerous and ongoing. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is partially established. Applicant cites the conduct of his spouse while \nhe was deployed that resulted in large portions of the alleged debt. However, he does \nnot support his claim that he acted responsibly under the circumstances to resolve these \neither through payment or with legal action. Where he states he disputes the debt and \nintends to pursue legal action, there is no further evidence of action on his part. \nAG \u00b6 20 (c) is partially established. Applicant received financial counseling during \nhis active duty service. He stated he intended to seek further financial counseling for the \nproblem from the VA. He has not shown that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is partially established. Applicant provided evidence to support his \nassertions that he had paid the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. He provided his SCRA checks \nto show he was able to make payment plans for the remaining debts. With the exception \nof SOR \u00b6 1.h, the August 2022 credit report and the April 2020 credit report show inaction \non his part for the remaining debts. Merely waiting for a debt to drop off a credit report by \nthe passage of time is not a factor in an applicant's favor. See ISCR Case No. 99-9020 \nat 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). I considered the character statement of his colleague and supervisor \nin the context of the whole person. (AE13.) After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions under Guidelines F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his \ndelinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nFor Applicant \nAgainst Applicant \n Subparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n     Subparagraph 1.h: \n  Subparagraphs 1.i-1.j: \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Simultaneously, her roommate moved out \nof their rental abruptly, and the leasing company charged Applicant $3,120 in fees for \nbreaking her lease. She also experienced financial strain when she had medical issues \nrelated to a minor surgery in approximately 2014 and a major surgery in 2016, for which \nshe was hospitalized.

Company A provided her with credit counseling. \nCompany A told her that she did not qualify for consolidation, due to the nature of her \ncollection accounts and her desire to include debts that were not yet delinquent.

(Tr. a 22-24, 74, 75-82, 89-95; GE 1; AE A) \nIn December 2020 and December 2021, Applicant\u2019s employer gave her favorable \nperformance evaluations; end-of-year bonuses in recognition of her great work; and \nsalary increases effective January 2021 and January 2022, respectively. Character letters \nfrom five individuals, which included her immediate supervisor since 2020, her manager \nsince 2020, and a friend of nearly 20 years, attested to her reliability, trustworthiness, and \ndedication. (AE A) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.

Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nApplicant was unable to pay her debts, and she failed to file her federal and state \nincome tax returns for TY 2017, as required. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a), 19(c), and 19(f). \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n7 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to her financial problems. The \nfirst prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), she must provide \nevidence that she acted responsibly under her circumstances. Applicant filed her federal \nincome tax return for TY 2017 in September 2021, and she stated that she would mail \nher completed state income tax returns for TY 2017 to the state tax authority. She forfeited \nher federal and state income tax refunds for TY 2017 due to her late filing. She understood \nthe importance of timely filing her federal and state income tax returns, and she intended \nto timely file all of her future income tax returns. In addition, she provided documentation \nreflecting that she resolved SOR debts \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.p. She established good-faith \nefforts to repay her debts when she began working with Company A in October 2019. Her \nfinances are under control and they no longer cast doubt on her judgment, \ntrustworthiness, and reliability. I find that \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(g) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case.

He \ncited his divorce as a cause for the debts. (GE 1 at 36-41, 44) He discussed his \nfinances in background interviews conducted a month later. (GE 2 at 8-11) \nApplicant testified that most of his debts were accrued during his marriage. His \nwife was responsible for filing their tax returns, and he learned after their divorce that \nshe had not done so. They would typically file joint returns. (Tr. 36-39, 55-57) \nThe SOR concerns allegations of late-filed federal income tax returns (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a), past-due federal income taxes (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.e), state income taxes (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, \n1.g), federal student loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l-1.o), and consumer debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h-1.k, 1.p). \nSOR \u00b6 1.a concerns late-filed federal income tax returns for tax years (TY) 2017, \n2018, and 2019. Applicant reported on an interrogatory response to DOHA that he filed \nthe returns in July 2021 but was not on a payment plan.

(Tr. 37-41, 57, 81, 82) He has had an accountant to help prepare his taxes for \nseveral years. (Tr. 85-86) \nApplicant testified that he received a letter from the IRS indicating that he owed \n$3,556 in total past-due taxes as of April 2023, but he clarified after the hearing that this \nfigure is for TY 2018. (AE C) He plans to pay off his taxes by the end of May 2024.

(GE 2 at 6, GE 2 at 29-30; Tr. 82-83). Post-hearing \ndocumentation shows no state tax balance owed. (Tr. 39; AE E) He said he has filed all \nof his state tax returns from TY 2017 through TY 2022.

(GE 3, GE 4, GE 5) Applicant does not \ndispute the status of his student loans. He incurred them in 2013. He could not afford to \naddress his student loans after his divorce, when he assumed responsibility for all \nhousehold bills. The credit reports show the most recent payment was in July 2017. (GE \n6; Tr. 94-95) He is aware that they have been in deferred status due to the COVID \npandemic since March 2020, but that repayment is soon to resume.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing \nthe complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. The protection of the national security is the paramount \nconsideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being \nconsidered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are \nreasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nclassified information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them, and the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or classified information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding [classified] information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened risk\u201d \nrequired to is a relatively low standard. It denotes a risk greater than the normal risk \ninherent in having a family member living under a foreign government or owning \nproperty in a foreign country. The totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to a foreign country as well \nas each individual tie must be considered. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges a foreign influence security concern due to Applicant\u2019s \nrelationship with a Ukrainian woman he met on a dating website in 2019. They began \ndating long-distance, he visited her in Ukraine several times, and they were briefly \nengaged. Applicant disclosed the relationship on his SCA. However, he ended the \nrelationship in March 2021, and they have had no further contact. Applicant testified that \nany attempts to coerce him through her would meet stiff resistance. He is now \ncohabitating with another woman in the United States, and they have had a child. While \na heightened risk is unquestionably established given the ongoing war in Ukraine, \napplication of AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) still requires contact with or connection to a foreign \nperson at issue. I find that Applicant has neither ongoing contact or connections with his \nformer girlfriend and fianc\u00e9e in Ukraine to suggest a current foreign influence security \nconcern. Nether AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) apply, and foreign influence security concerns are \nnot established. Therefore, no mitigation conditions warrant discussion. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, security, and ability to protect \nclassified or classified information. Financial distress can also be caused \nor exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of \npersonnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns under the \nfinancial considerations guideline. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has incurred several financial delinquencies in recent years. This \nincludes federal student loans and consumer debts. As his marriage was ending, he \nalso failed to file several years of federal income tax returns. Past-due federal tax debt \nresulted. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, security, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nSome of Applicant\u2019s financial debts and tax filing issues are attributable to the \nend of his marriage, in 2019. This was a circumstance beyond his control, and AG \u00b6 \n20(b) therefore has some application. His failure to timely file federal income tax returns \n(TY 2017, TY 2018, and 2019) is limited to this period.

While it is not established by IRS documentation \nthat his 2017 return was accepted, I believe that he prepared it in July 2021 as he did \nthe others. His past-due tax filings are being resolved and are under control. AG \u00b6 20(g) \napplies to these filings. \nApplicant\u2019s state tax debt (SOR \u00b6 1.f) is resolved, and there is no allegation (or \nevidence) of late-filed state tax returns. His federal tax debt, however, is ongoing. Post-\nhearing documentation indicates that he owes about $3,500 for TY 2018 and about \n$7,600 for TY 2019. Resolution of federal tax debt for TY 2016 (alleged at $3,249) and \nTY 2017 (alleged at $4,919) is not established. Further, Applicant is not on a payment \nplan to address his past-due federal income taxes. Instead, he is relying on the IRS\u2019s \nrecapturing of his refunds. This is not sufficient evidence of a good-faith effort to pay \nthese debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and 20(g) do not apply to mitigate his past-due federal income \ntax debt. \nApplicant\u2019s federal student loans are also unresolved. He earned his associate \ndegree in 2013. There is no evidence of student loan payments since 2017. While this \nmay be due, in part, to the end of his marriage, he has also been gainfully employed for \nseveral years. While his federal student loans have been in forbearance status since \nMarch 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, that does not excuse his prior inaction. \nWith student loan repayments now resuming, Applicant will have to establish a \nreasonable repayment plan going forward. As of now, he has not done so. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) \nand 20(d) do not apply to his federal student loans. \nApplicant is resolving some of his other debts, such as SOR \u00b6 1.j, now in a \npayment plan, and SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.p are resolved. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to them. Other \nlarger debts remain, and he does not yet have a reasonable plan to address them. AG \u00b6 \n20(b) and 20(d) therefore do not fully apply. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are ongoing, so AG \u00b6 20(a) does not fully apply. In particular, \nthe ongoing past-due federal tax debt and federal student loans continue to cast doubt \non his judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. He needs to establish reasonable and \nresponsible repayment plans for those debts (and the other remaining consumer debts) \nand take steps towards putting those plans into effect through a track record of steady \npayments. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security determination by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \ndetermination of public trust must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines B and F in my whole-person analysis. \nA Guideline B security concern is not established. However, Applicant has a \nhistory of delinquent debts, particularly taxes and student loans. His debts will remain a \nsecurity concern until he shows a documented track record of good-faith efforts to \nresolve them. This is not to say he cannot apply for a clearance again in the future when \nhe has established financial responsibility towards his debts. But at this time, he has not \nmet his burden of mitigating the security concern shown by his past-due student loans, \ntax debts, and other debts. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns arising \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:   \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:   \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:   \n \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraph 1.h:   \n \nFor Applicant  \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j:   \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.k-1.o: \n \nAgainst Applicant  \nSubparagraph 1.p:   \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational security interests of the United States to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access \nto classified information.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nApplicant mitigated financial considerations concerns but did not mitigate personal \nconduct concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information or to hold a sensitive \nposition is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 21, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) \nConsolidated Central Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) \nto Applicant detailing reasons why under the financial considerations guideline the \nDCSA could not make the preliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting \na security clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \nwhether a security clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.

This \ncase was assigned to me on August 8, 2022. A hearing was scheduled for December \n15, 2022, via Teams Teleconference Services, and was heard on the scheduled date. \nAt the hearing, the Government\u2019s case consisted of six exhibits. (GEs 1-6) Applicant \nrelied on two witnesses (his wife and himself) and 12 exhibits. The transcript (Tr.) was \nreceived on December 29, 2022. \nProcedural Issues \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to \npermit him the opportunity to supplement the record with documentation of a character \nreference from his spouse. For good cause shown, Applicant was granted 14 calendar \ndays to supplement the record. (Tr. 52) Department Counsel was afforded two days to \nrespond. Applicant did not supplement the record \n  Summary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F of the SOR, Applicant allegedly accumulated three consumer \ndebts exceeding $21,000. Allegedly, these debts have not been resolved. \nUnder Guideline E, Applicant allegedly (a) between 2017 and at least December \n2018 communicated and provided monetary assistance in excess of $15,000 each to \ntwo women he met on an online dating website, of whom one was a citizen and resident \nof the Philippines and (b) falsified his electronic questionnaires for investigations \nprocessing (e-QIP) in June 2019, by answering \u201cno\u201d and thereby deliberately failing to \ndisclose that he provided approximately $17,000 to the Philippines citizen and resident. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the alleged delinquent debts \nand foreign payments with explanations, while denying any intent to falsify his e-QIP. \nHe claimed he contacted his SOR creditors 1.a and 1.b and made payment \narrangements with the creditors to make monthly payments of $50. He claimed the SOR \n1.c debt was charged off due to fraudulent activity and was reported to local law \nenforcement and copied to the creditor.  \nAddressing the allegations covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.b, Applicant denied the \nallegations and characterized his alleged $15,000 respective payments (SOR \u00b6 2.a) to \nthe two women he met on a dating website as highly questionable. He further claimed \nthat he misunderstood the meaning of providing support to a foreign national when he \ndenied providing financial support to a foreign national in the e-QIP he completed.. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 55-year-old civilian of a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance.

(GE 1) He has no \nchildren from this marriage. (GE 1) He remarried in June 1998 and has no children \nfrom this marriage. (GE 1; Tr. 45, 59-60) Applicant has taken vocational and college \nclasses over the course of a number of years (January 2000 to March 2012) without \nearning a degree or diploma. (GE1; Tr. 16-17) He enlisted in the Army Inactive Reserve \nin October 1985 and served five years of military service. He received an honorable \ndischarge in February 1990. (GEs 1-2 and AEs F-G; Tr. 19) \nSince November 2021, Applicant has been employed by his current employer as \na network installer. (GE 1; Tr. 17, 44) Previously, he has worked for other employers \n(some contemporaneously) in various positions in the engineering and electronics \nfields. (GE 1) Applicant has previously held a security clearance, both during his military \nservice and civilian employments. (GE 1; Tr. 17-18, 36) \nApplicant\u2019s finances \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports documented Applicant\u2019s accumulation of three \ndelinquent, charged-off accounts between 2018 and 2021. (GEs 3-6) Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent accounts are reported as follows: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a (for $2,282); 1.b (for $4,031); \nand  1.c (for $15,207). He attributed his debt delinquencies to oversight and fraudulent \nuse of his credit card by a woman he befriended on-line. (GE 2 and AEs B-E; Tr. 20-\n27)) \nApplicant has since arranged payment plans with SOR creditors 1.a and 1.b that \ncall for $50 a month, beginning in June 2021 with SOR creditor 1.a and September \n2022 with SOR creditor 1.b. (AEs A-B; Tr. 22-24, 38-40) Addressing his disputed debt \nwith SOR creditor 1.c, Applicant filed a criminal complaint with the attorney general of \nhis state in March 2018, claiming the African woman he met in an online chat room in \n2018 asked for financial assistance in exchange for an investment opportunity in an \noverseas construction company. (GE 2 and AE D Tr. 24-26) Once he saw deposits \nappear in his SOR creditor 1.c account and then mysteriously removed before his \naccount was linked to three other on-line accounts unknown to him, he contacted his \nbank (SOR creditor 1.c) and reported unauthorized activity in his account.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be \nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive \nreliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in \narriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n           The Concern:  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds.  .  .  .

AG \n\u00b6 15. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.

See Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.1.14; McCormick \non Evidence \u00a7 262 (6th  ed. 2006). His admitted debts are fully documented and create \njudgment issues as well over the management of his finances. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n01059 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004). Applicant\u2019s admissions can be weighed along with his \nexplanations and other evidence developed during the hearing.  \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position.

For these \naccounts, mitigating condition (MC) \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated and is adhering to a \ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d is entitled to \npartial application.

Neither \nMC \u00b6 20(e) nor any of the other potentially available mitigating conditions are available \nto Applicant based on the evidence developed in the record. \nIn addressing his remaining SOR debt delinquency, Applicant has been less \nsuccessful. Afforded hearing and post-hearing opportunities to address his disputed but \nstill unresolved SOR \u00b6 1.c debt, the debt remains unresolved and outstanding. His \ndisputed account with SOR creditor \u00b6 1.c over his claims of fraudulent use of the credit \ncard at issue lacks any reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the charged-off \ndebt and is not accompanied by any documented evidence of efforts to resolve the \naccount Neither MC \u00b6 20(e) nor any of the potentially available other mitigating \nconditions are available to Applicant based on the evidence developed in the record. \nWithout any more post-hearing documentation of Applicant efforts to resolve this \naccount, this disputed debt cannot be credited as fully resolved. \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of accrued debts. See ISCR Case No. 19-02593 at 4-5 (App. Bd. \nOct. 18, 2021); ISCR Case No. 19-01599 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2020). Based on the \nevidence presented, Applicant is not able to demonstrate a sufficient tangible track \nrecord of actual debt reduction to satisfy Appeal Board guidance. Payment promises \nalone that are not accompanied by material good-faith payments still reflect promises to \npay that do not meet the good-faith payment requirements of MC 20(d). \nPersonal conduct concerns \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s communications and monetary \nassistance to two foreign nationals: one a Philippine citizen and resident and the other \nfrom Africa. Over the course of two years between 2017 and 2018, Applicant \nmaintained frequent contact with these women and helped them with over $17,000 in \ncombined monetary assistance. \nApplicable disqualifying conditions are DC \u00b6 16(c), \u201ccredible adverse information \nin several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination \nunder any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, \n9 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard classified \ninformation,\u201d is applicable to Applicant\u2019s situation.

None of Applicant\u2019s e-QIP omissions of his communications \nwith the two foreign nationals he met from the Philippines and Africa were voluntarily \ncorrected by Applicant in his ensuing PSI before he was confronted by the OPM agent \nwho interviewed him months later. \nApplicable DCs are \u00b6\u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification \nof relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or trustworthiness, or \naward fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d and 16(b), \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading \ninformation; or concealing or omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an \nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical or mental health professional \ninvolved in making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative,\u201d apply to Applicant\u2019s \nsituation. \nBased on the evidence presented, none of the potentially available mitigating \nconditions apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. Providing materially false information in \nhis e-QIP and ensuing PSI about the past communications and financial assistance he \nprovided two foreign national women over a period of years not only impaired the DoD\u2019s \nability to ascertain Applicant\u2019s past and current foreign contacts and relationships, but it \nrevealed serious lapses of candor and judgment by Applicant \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his finances and candor lapses are fully compatible with \nminimum standards for holding a clearance. Taking into account Applicant\u2019s credited \ndefense contributions and his reconciliation with his wife who he shared his online \ncontacts and monetary remittances with, insufficient evidence has been presented to \nenable him to mitigate his delinquent and still only partially resolved SOR debts. \nApplicant\u2019s frequent contacts with foreign nationals, his furnished financial support to \nthese foreign nationals, and his candor lapses when faced with disclosure choices \npreclude Applicant from meeting the minimum requirements of security clearance \neligibility. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

Around that time his daughter was born. His wife provided full-time care for \ntheir son until he was five years old, and was unable to return to full-time work until 2018. \nAll of these circumstances created a financial hardship for his family. (Tr. 24-28; GE 1) \nApplicant took out about $62,000 in student loans to finance his college education. \nHe reported that after he completed his studies, he had a six-month grace period before \nhis loan payments were supposed to start. He stated that at the time, it was beyond his \nfinancial abilities to make student-loans payments. He did not formally apply for \ndeferment, and his student loans went into collection status. (Tr. 24-47; GE 2) \nApplicant reported that when he started working for a defense contractor in 2013, \nhe made about $15 an hour as a pipe fitter, and earned small salary increases yearly. He \nbecame a salaried employee in 2017 and earned about $52,000 yearly. Applicant \nasserted that he has received promotions at work since that time, and now earns about \n$71,000. (Tr. 24-47) \nApplicant stated that in 2015, his pay was garnished for $53 a month for his student \nloan debt. He claimed that the garnishment only lasted a few months, and then the \ngarnishment ended. He reported that in 2019, his financial situation was more stable, and \nhe contacted the lender to rehabilitate his student loans. He stated that he started by \nmaking $5 monthly payments and after nine months of rehabilitation, the loans were no \nlonger in a default status. He reported that in 2020, he made several $363 loans \npayments, before requesting an income-based repayment plan. His payments under the \nnew plan were $61 monthly. Applicant made those payments through December 2021, \nbefore his loans were moved into the national Covid-19 student loan forbearance \nprogram. Applicant is scheduled to restart loan payments once the government \nterminates the national forbearance program.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s student loans were in collection status for about five years before he \nbegan the rehabilitation program. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant contacted his lender in 2019 to rehabilitate his student loans. Once he \ncompleted that program, he established an income-based repayment plan. Applicant \nmade loan payments under that plan until his student loans were transferred into the \nnational Covid-19 forbearance program. Once the government terminates that program, \nhis loan payments will resume. He provided sufficient documentation to show that his \nstudent loans are in a current status. Applicant and his family had unusual financial \nhardships over a seven-year period due to circumstances beyond their control, which are \nunlikely to recur. Once his finances were stable, he acted responsibly and made a good \nfaith effort to address his debts. He has been working to meet his student loan obligations \nsince 2019. Applicant is not required to show that he has paid or resolved all of his debts, \nor that he has done so in any particular way. He has shown that he has a reasonable plan \nto resolve his debts and has implemented it. These financial circumstances do not cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (b), and \n(d) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I considered his character letters and his service working for a \ndefense contractor. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. \nApplicant\u2019s financial hardships did not arise out of irresponsible behavior. He had \noverwhelming family financial obligations and was simply unable to make student loan \npayments after earning his degree. He eventually took appropriate action to address his \ndelinquent student loans and will continue with his repayment plan. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant mitigated the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance is granted. \nRoss D. Hyams \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has incurred over $27,000 in past-due indebtedness over the last several \nyears. None of the debts listed in the SOR have been resolved, no matter how small. \nThese facts establish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and \nshift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe evidence does not establish that any of the above mitigating conditions apply \nto Applicant\u2019s debt situation. She states that the fact she was a single mother with three \nchildren had an effect on her finances. That fact has been considered. However, that is \nonly one part of the equation. She did not provide any evidence showing that she is \nengaging in a good-faith effort to responsibly resolve any of her debts. She has known \nsince May 2020 of the Government\u2019s concern. As also stated, she did not submit any \nfinancial information from which I can make a finding that she can avoid additional \ndelinquencies or resolve her current delinquent debts in a reasonable, responsible, and \ntimely fashion. Paragraph 1 is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s potential for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not mitigated the \nconcerns over her considerable past-due indebtedness. The potential for pressure, \nexploitation, or duress remains substantial. Overall, the record evidence creates \nsubstantial doubt as to her suitability for national security eligibility and a security \nclearance at the present time. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.v: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence admitted into evidence \nestablish the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability \nto satisfy debts\u201d); and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d) \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are relevant: \n(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) are fully applicable. Applicant's financial difficulties were \nincurred as result of his divorce, which was a circumstance beyond his control. His former \nspouse did not abide by the marital settlement agreement. He has demonstrated through \nhis actions that he is determined to overcome his indebtedness. He downsized his life \nand has adhered to a plan. He knows that regaining financial responsibility is essential to \nqualify for a security clearance and has taken reasonable and measured steps to resolve \nhis debts. While he does not present a perfect case in mitigation, a perfection is not \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrequired. Under the limited circumstances of this case, I find that his finances no longer \ngenerate questions about his judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. Security concerns about his finances are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, and mindful of my obligation \nto resolve close cases in favor of national security, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I conclude he has \ncarried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nhim eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:     \nFOR APPLICANT \nFor Applicant \n6 \n Subparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

She claimed that the truck debt covered by SOR \u00b6 1.d \nwas discharged in her Chapter 7 bankruptcy; even though the consumer creditor has \ndeclined to pick up the vehicle.

Between December 2017 and December 2019, she \nworked for her husband\u2019s privately owned masonry business: initially with general \nassistance to her husband\u2019s business and later (beginning in 2018) as an office \nmanager. (GE 2; Tr. 36-39) Before her marriage, she was employed as an assistant \nmanager for a dentist, where she worked for over 12 years. (GE 1; Tr. 24) She has \nnever held a security clearance. \nApplicant\u2019s finances \nBefore her marriage in December 2016, Applicant enjoyed good credit and stable \nfinances. Following her marriage in December 2016, she began helping her husband in \nhis masonry business with cleaning and filing. (Tr. 36) By 2018, she had assumed other \ncompany tasks and responsibilities, including keeping track of business purchases and \npayouts and managing the company\u2019s payroll. (Tr. 37-40) During her tenure with her \nhusband\u2019s company, she aided the company\u2019s formal office manager and was given a \ncompany business card to facilitate her ability to sign company checks when the office \nmanager was unavailable. (Tr. 40) While Applicant never owned any proprietary interest \nin her husband\u2019s business, held any officer\u2019s position in the business, or exercised any \ncontrol over the business, she and her husband presumably filed joint tax returns for tax \nyears 2017-2018. These tax returns could be expected to include reported income and \nexpenses from her husband\u2019s business. \nIn 2019, an IRS agent visited Applicant\u2019s work site. (Tr. 34) During one of the \nagent\u2019s visits, he inquired about her company\u2019s 2018 tax debt. (Tr. 41) Applicant \nacknowledged to the agent her understanding that her husband owed money on his \ncompany\u2019s 2018 federal taxes. (Tr. 41) Asked why he owed business taxes, she told the \nagent she did not know. (Tr. 42) While Applicant\u2019s involvement with her husband\u2019s \nbusiness in 2018 was very limited, she was listed on the company\u2019s signature card. It \nwas her listing on the company\u2019s business card that prompted the agent\u2019s questions \nabout her husband\u2019s company and taxes owed. (Tr. 43) \nIn April 2019, the IRS filed a notice of federal tax lien against both Applicant and \nher husband for federal taxes owed for tax year 2016 in the amount of $13,782. (GE 4; \nTr. 43) For this tax year, Applicant and her husband filed separate federal income tax \nreturns due to their late marriage in December 2016. (Tr. 43) Because Applicant had \nnothing to do with her husband\u2019s business before their marriage, she denied any \nresponsibility for the taxes owed for tax year 2016. (GE 4; Tr. 43-44) For further proof \nthat she does not personally owe any federal taxes for tax year 2016, she cited to the \nGovernment\u2019s failure to file any proof of claim in her January 2022 Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy petition. (Tr. 45-46) To date, the IRS\u2019s 2016 tax lien remains unsettled and \nunresolved. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn November 2019, the IRS filed a notice of federal tax lien against Applicant \nexclusively for federal taxes owed for tax year 2018 in the amount of $102,471. (GE 5 \nand AE A) The lien covers an original tax assessment of $17,300, along with added \nassessments throughout the 2018 tax year for accrued penalties and interest. (GE 5, \nAE A, and HE 1) \nWhile Applicant has made in-person inquiries to the IRS of why she owes taxes \nfor her husband\u2019s business, she has not to date received any substantive assistance \nfrom the IRS on how she can resolve this 2018 company tax debt. (Tr. 50-51) Even with \nher extra jobs, she is not in a current position to address this debt without help from \neither her ex-husband, her father-in-law (previous owner of her ex-husband\u2019s business), \nor both. (Tr. 29-30, 42, 53-55) \nApplicant\u2019s stated intentions are to repay the IRS on this 2018 tax debt, but she\nneeds a manageable repayment plan or compromise of the debt with the IRS to do so. \n(Tr. 55) Applicant assured she will continue to work with her legal counsel and \naccountant to achieve a compromise of the tax debt that she can safely manage. (Tr. \n56) Afforded a post-hearing opportunity to document applications to the IRS for either \nan installment agreement, abatement of penalties and interest, or compromise of debt, \nshe has not provided any. \n \nApplicant has continued to look to her ex-husband to fulfill his accepted \nresponsibilities for federal taxes owed for tax years 2016 and 2018, both explicit under \nthe terms of their divorce decree and implicit by virtue of his 100% ownership interest in \nhis business. (AE A and K; Tr. 25-28) Nothing in Applicant\u2019s divorce decree, however, \nbinds the IRS to pursue her husband exclusively in its enforcement initiatives. \nBecause Applicant and her ex-husband filed joint federal tax returns for tax year \n2018, they became jointly and severally liable for federal income taxes for 2018. And, \nthe IRS federal tax lien for tax year 2018 lists only Applicant and her social security \nnumber as the taxpayer covered by the IRS tax lien. (GE 5 and AEs B and O) \nPresumably, the IRS filed a similar tax lien against Applicant\u2019s ex-husband (using her \nhusband\u2019s social security number); although, this is not documented in the record. (GEs \n5; Tr. 27-28) Whether the IRS ever pursued Applicant\u2019s husband to enforce satisfaction \nof its 2016 and 2018 tax liens is unclear. \nSince the issuance of IRS tax liens for tax years 2016 and 2018 in November \n2019 against Applicant (and presumably her husband as well), Applicant has taken no \ndocumented steps to address her reported tax liabilities for these covered tax years, \ndespite the plethora of payment options available to her. Options available to her since \n2019 include applications for installment agreement relief using IRS form 9465. \nRequired information in this request form includes data about the taxpayer\u2019s income \nreceipts and affordable monthly payments to facilitate IRS means testing. \nOther available tax relief options include (a) claims for refund and requests for \nabatement using IRS form 843 and (b) offers in compromise based on the taxpayer\u2019s \n4 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndocumented ability to pay (calculated by consideration of the taxpayer\u2019s income and \nexpenses and asset equity). Neither these latter stated options nor the installment \nagreement option were apparently availed of by Applicant or her tax accountants (either \nbefore her hearing or post-hearing) to seek cancellation, or abatement, or compromise \nof the covered assessments in issue. Whether Applicant\u2019s ex-husband ever addressed \nthe taxes owed by his company for the tax years in issue is unclear. \nThis is not to minimize the financial hardships Applicant\u2019s ex-husband has placed \non her and her children. Not only has her ex-husband left her with heavy tax debts that \nrightfully belong to him, but he has failed to meet the child support obligations he agreed \nto in his 2017 court-approved parenting plan. (AE L; Tr. 70-71) Nor has Applicant\u2019s ex-\nhusband reportedly complied with court-ordered monthly child support payments ($445 \na month) since the entry of the child support order in November 2021. (AE I) Asked \nwhether she had ever considered taking legal steps against her ex-husband to enforce \nchild support compliance, she replied that \u201cI cannot find him.\u201d (Tr. 71) \nEssentially, from Applicant\u2019s accounts, her ex-husband abandoned her and her \nchildren and left her to fend for herself in raising her family and covering her ex-\nhusband\u2019s tax obligations. Considering all of the facts and circumstances of Applicant\u2019s \ntax and family difficulties, her claims are laden with equities worthy of consideration \nwere such claims to be evaluated inter se by a court of competent jurisdiction over the \nmarital disputants. Third parties like the IRS, however, fall outside of the jurisdiction and \nauthority of a state family court and cannot be bound by a state court\u2019s orders arising \nfrom a marital dispute.  \nIn May 1992, Applicant petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief. (AE N) She \nscheduled assets of $35,136 and liabilities of $51,364. Her listed liabilities were \ncomprised of secured claims totaling $27,741 and unsecured non-priority claims of \n$23,364. (AE N) Applicant\u2019s non-priority unsecured claims included SOR debts covered \nby SOR \u00b6 1.c (for $11,087) and SOR \u00b6 1.d (for $27,741). \nIn an amended Schedule E filing in May 2022, Applicant added a priority IRS \n2018 tax debt ($108,696) to her scheduled unsecured creditors. (AE N) The IRS, in \nturn, filed a proof of claim in June 2022 in the amount of $93,504. (AE P) Whether this \nreduced figure represents a calculated reduction of the tax amount covered by its 2019 \ntax lien against Applicant for tax year 2018 is unclear. \nApplicant\u2019s listed secured and unsecured claims were discharged in bankruptcy \nby order of the bankruptcy court in August 2022. (AE N) Dispositions of both the 2018 \nand 2016 tax liens remain pending and unresolved. \nWhile both of the consumer debts listed in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d) have \nbeen discharged in bankruptcy and are no longer enforceable, Applicant still retains the \nvehicle covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. . . . AG \u00b6 18. \n Burdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information.

Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are comprised of two federal tax liens \nfiled in 2019 for tax years 2016 and 2018, respectively and two consumer debts totaling \nmore than $38,000. Applicant\u2019s debt delinquencies warrant the application of three \ndisqualifying conditions under the financial consideration guidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \n\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; and \n19(f). \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s four admitted debts with explanations and clarifications require no \nindependent proof to substantiate them. See Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.1.14; McCormick \non Evidence \u00a7 262 (6th  ed. 2006). Her admitted debts are fully documented and create \njudgment issues as well over the management of her finances. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n01059 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004). Although she qualified her admissions with \nexplanations, her admissions can be weighed along with other evidence developed \nduring the hearing.  \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving tax and other debt \ndelinquencies are critical to an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, \nand good judgment in following rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking \naccess to classified information or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. \n14-06808 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd.

Considered together contextually, these circumstances enable her to \ntake partial advantage of mitigating condition MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in \nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d Because she has not followed up \nwith documented initiatives to address and resolve her federal tax liens with the options \navailable to since the IRS liens were filed in 2019, she may not at this time take \nadvantage of the second prong (\u201cacting responsibly under the circumstances\u201d) of MC \u00b6 \n20(b). \nTwo major consumer debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d) have been satisfied and \nresolved by Applicant through her discharged Chapter 7 bankruptcy. For these two \nresolved accounts, application of MC \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated and is adhering to \na good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d bears partial \napplication to Applicant\u2019s financial situation. In addressing her remaining federal tax \nliens, Applicant has been less successful. Afforded hearing and post-hearing \nopportunities to address her still unresolved federal tax lien accounts, Applicant \nprovided no supplemental documentation of pursuing the options available to her such \nas applying for an installment agreement, seeking rebatement of accrued penalties and \ninterest, and/or requesting a compromise of tax debts. \nTo be sure, Applicant\u2019s difficulties with her former spouse provide important \nmitigation as circumstances beyond her control. There are many equities and merit in \nApplicant\u2019s claims for tax relief, or at the very least, abatement of taxes associated with \nher ex-husband\u2019s business. But DOHA is not the proper forum to resolve her claims. \nDOHA\u2019s jurisdictional reach is limited to resolving issues related to security clearance \neligibility. \nDOHA authority does not empower its judges to resolve federal or state tax \ndisputes, no matter how persuasive Applicant\u2019s equities might appear from her \npresented evidence. Applicant\u2019s potential remedies for her tax grievances lie with the \nIRS, and beyond to the U.S. Tax Court, once she exhausted her administrative \nremedies with the IRS. Without more documented successful efforts to resolve her tax \ndebts in this proceeding, her promises to continue working on resolving her tax debts \nwith her lawyers and accountants reflect still unfulfilled promises to resolve the \nunderlying debts. \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of accrued debts.

Taking into account Applicant\u2019s credited defense contributions and \nher explanations of the tax debts attributed to her in the SOR, insufficient evidence has \nbeen presented to enable her to mitigate the federal tax liens attributable to her joint \nand several accrual of delinquent federal taxes. With these federal tax liens still \nunsettled and unresolved, she is not able to produce enough mitigating evidence to \nensure her ability to maintain sufficient control of her finances to meet minimum \nstandards for holding a security clearance. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484\nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person.

On August 11, August 20, and August 28, 2020, she \nprovided personal interviews (PSIs) with an investigator from the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM).

I asked her several questions concerning her educational and \nprofessional background. I concluded that she was qualified to represent herself. (Tr. 6-\n13) Because Applicant did not have a hard copy of the proposed Government exhibits \nin-hand, I described the essential portions of each exhibit to her. Initially, she could not \nrecall her July 2020 security clearance application (GE 1) or her August 2020 PSIs (GE \n2), but after I read the contents of parts of the exhibits to her, she remembered and did \nnot object to the exhibits being admitted into evidence. She objected to the credit \nbureau reports (CBRs) at GE 3 and GE 4 because they were dated. She believed that \nan updated CBR should be entered into evidence. I informed her of her responsibility in \nproving her case to submit an updated credit report. I then stated to her that though GE \n3 and 4 were dated, the age of the reports did not preclude their admissibility. The four \nexhibits were admitted into evidence.

From June 2018 to July 2018, \nApplicant was a pharmacy technician, but resigned before she completed training. She \nworked as a security officer during the month of May 2018. (GE 1 at 12-18) Applicant \nhas never been investigated for a security clearance. (GE 1 at 30) \nIn Applicant\u2019s August 2020 PSIs, the OPM investigator asked her about her \ndelinquent debts listed in the SOR. After conveying her knowledge about the status of \nmost of the debts, her uniform explanation for why the listed accounts became \ndelinquent was that she was young, she did not earn a sufficient amount of money, she \ndid not understand debts, and did not comprehend how bad credit would affect her later \nin life. (GE 2 at 4-5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a \u2013 This is an installment loan account for a car that was charged off \nin July 2016 (AE 3 at 6), and repossessed in October 2017. She made no payments on \nthe car after it was repossessed. (Tr. 31-33) Applicant was waiting until after the sale of \nthe auto to determine how much she may owe. (GE 2 at 5) The account has not been \nresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b \u2013 This is student loan account that Applicant\u2019s stepfather opened at \na federal credit union. Applicant explained in her August 2020 PSIs that her stepfather \ncosigned for the loan and was supposed to pay the account for her. However, when \nApplicant\u2019s mother divorced the stepfather, he decided not to repay the loan. As maker \nof the account, Applicant is still primarily responsible for the loan, with the cosigner \nbecoming liable when the maker defaulted. (GE 3 at 5) Applicant claimed the posted \namount was incorrect. At the conclusion of the hearing, she promised to investigate the \nstatus of the account and make a payment. No additional documentation was provided. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g \u2013 These four student loan accounts were opened \nbetween September 2014 and January 2017. The accounts became delinquent in July \n2017. (GE 4 at 4-5) Applicant claimed the accounts had been consolidated into one \naccount and were being paid through garnishment. The Government was garnishing \n15% of her wages. Applicant could not remember when the garnishment started, but the \naccounts have been in forbearance due to the imposition of the Government pause on \nrepayment of student loans that commenced in March 2020.

Applicant \nclaims that someone opened this account by fraudulently using her name.

She promised to pay all her debts as \nsoon as possible. She indicated that she was disputing two of the delinquent accounts, \nbut she could not remember which ones. The investigator asked her to supply additional \ndocumentation concerning her delinquent debts, but she never did. (GE 2 at 10-11) \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel asked Applicant when she believed \nher financial problems began. She replied that the troubles emerged while she was \nattending school in another state. Her August 2020 PSIs indicate that she was enrolled \nat out-of-state schools from August 2015 to April 2017. (Tr. 57; GE 2 at 4) Applicant \nalso noted she was off work for a year after the birth of her son. She paid $960 a month \nfor her son\u2019s day care until January or February 2023, when she and her former \nboyfriend (her son\u2019s father) began evenly dividing the cost of her son\u2019s monthly daycare \nexpenses. (Tr. 52-54) She mentioned helping her mother in unidentified ways and \nassisting her siblings. (Tr. 57) \nDuring the hearing, Applicant was reminded several times to submit documents \nto bolster her claims of addressing the listed debts or enrolling in a debt consolidation \nplan, but no documents were furnished. She did not bring a copy of the Government \nexhibits to the hearing because she had never faced a security clearance hearing \nbefore. (Tr. 63) She agreed to submit a budget describing her income an expenses, but \nno budgetary information was submitted. (Tr. 50, 55) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \n5 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of \nincome is also a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal \nactivity, including espionage. \nAG \u00b6 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nA person\u2019s practice of paying her bills is a private matter until evidence reveals \nthat she is not paying her debts in a timely fashion. Adverse evidence from credit \nreports can usually meet the Government\u2019s obligation of proving delinquent debts. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02403 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) The Government credit reports establish that the listed \ndebts became delinquent between 2014 and July 2020. While Applicant asserts the \nGovernment pause shields her from adverse action regarding her student loan \naccounts, the loans had already been delinquent for three years before the pause. She \nhas provided no supporting evidence of her garnishment claims. She has provided no \nmitigating evidence addressing the other claims. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. AG \u00b6 \n19(b) applies because there is no documented evidence in the record to support \nApplicant\u2019s August 2020 PSI claims of intending to pay off or settle 13 of the 14 \ndelinquent debts listed in the SOR. \nAG \u00b6 20.

With no discernible changes in \nher financial practices, her financial problems will probably persist in the future. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to take charge of her delinquent debt responsibilities continues to \nraise doubts about her reliability and judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) recognizes that a person\u2019s financial problems can be caused by \nevents beyond her control. While Applicant has experienced two short periods of \nunemployment, she has been consistently employed since February 2019. I have \nconsidered her maternity leave for a year after her son was born in December 2020. \nHowever, only limited mitigating weight is given to this evidence given the plethora of \nundocumented claims she has made in her August 2020 PSIs and at the June 2023 \nhearing about paying on or paying off the listed delinquent debts. Neither AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) \nnor 20(d) apply as there is no good-faith effort to repay the past-due accounts. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) applies when financial counseling demonstrates that there are clear \nindications the financial problems are being resolved or under control. Though Applicant \npresented no evidence of financial counseling, she also submitted no evidence of her \nenrollment in the debt consolidation company. AG \u00b6 20(c) is unavailable for mitigation. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply to the circumstances of this case. Though Applicant \ncomplained that someone opened a phone account in her name, she provided no \nevidence to substantiate the basis of the dispute. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \n7 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the specific guidelines in the context of the \nnine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant has not furnished sufficient evidence to establish that her delinquent \ndebts are being resolved or under control. In Guideline F cases, the DOHA Appeals \nBoard has repeatedly held that, to establish her case in mitigation, an applicant must \npresent a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt repayments that result in debt reduction. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007) While an applicant is \nnot required to show that every debt listed in the SOR is paid, the applicant must show \nthat she has a plan for debt resolution and has taken significant action to implement the \nplan. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006). From the record \npresented, Applicant has no plan in place and furnished no evidence, except for her pay \noff of SOR \u00b6 1.n, of even sporadic payments on the past due accounts.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted all of the allegations. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He began working at his present job in December 2005. Before that he served in the U.S. Navy for nine years, after which he was honorably discharged. He has an associate\u2019s degree. He is married and has four adult children, three who still live at home and who he supports financially. He has held a security clearance without incident for approximately 27 years. (Tr. 6, 17, 30; GE 1) The SOR alleged 16 delinquent accounts (credit cards) totaling approximately $96,500. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.p) The debts are established by credit reports from March 2022 and April 2020; and his SOR admissions. (GE 2-3; Answer to SOR) Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties can largely be attributed to some major issues related to his wife\u2019s behavior. Sometime after 2010, his wife became addicted to prescription pain pills. It is unclear, but apparently she was arrested on drug-related charges. Applicant struggled to support the family during this time. His wife went to drug rehabilitation at some point, paid for by Applicant.

After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He began working at \nhis present job in December 2005. Before that he served in the U.S. Navy for nine years, \nafter which he was honorably discharged. He has an associate\u2019s degree. He is married \nand has four adult children, three who still live at home and who he supports financially. \nHe has held a security clearance without incident for approximately 27 years. (Tr. 6, 17, \n30; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged 16 delinquent accounts (credit cards) totaling approximately \n$96,500. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.p) The debts are established by credit reports from March 2022 \nand April 2020; and his SOR admissions. (GE 2-3; Answer to SOR) \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties can largely be attributed to some major issues \nrelated to his wife\u2019s behavior. Sometime after 2010, his wife became addicted to \nprescription pain pills. It is unclear, but apparently she was arrested on drug-related \ncharges. Applicant struggled to support the family during this time. His wife went to drug \nrehabilitation at some point, paid for by Applicant. In addition to his wife\u2019s drug issues, \nshe ran a day care center out of her home and was charged with felony child \nendangerment (no further information provided) in approximately 2017. Applicant stated \nhe was forced to use the family\u2019s financial resources to pay his wife\u2019s bail bond and \nattorney\u2019s fees resulting from the felony charge. He estimated that these expenses totaled \napproximately $40,000-$50,000. He used credit cards to fund these payments. Before \nthese expenditures, he had a total balance owed on all his credit cards of about $45,000. \n(Tr. 17, 20, 22) \nHe has settled three credit card debts as described below (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.i, and \n1.o), but he has failed to make any efforts to pay or contact any of the remaining creditors. \nHis rationale for inaction was that some of the debts were past or near the state\u2019s statute \nof limitations and are, or will become unenforceable. With this in mind, he did not want to \nstart paying towards these debts and restart the clock if he might lose his job because his \nclearance was not granted. So, he did nothing toward paying those debts. He contacted \nan attorney about the possibility of filing for bankruptcy protection, but he decided against \npursuing that option because he did not know how that might impact his security \nclearance.

Applicant testified that his current gross annual income is \napproximately $123,000 and that his wife\u2019s current gross income is approximately \n$45,000 annually. They own a home and are current on their monthly payments. He \nbelieves he has approximately $150,000 of equity in the home. He claimed that he \ntypically has approximately $1,000 left over at the end of the month after paying all his \nbills. He has approximately $150,000 in a retirement account and $3,000 in a savings \naccount. He did not present a written budget. (Tr. 19, 26; AE A1-A7) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b619 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial difficulties dating back several years. He \nincurred 16 delinquent debts totaling approximately $96,500. Thirteen of the debts remain \nunpaid. Applicant testified that he had the resources to pay the debts, but chose not to do \nso. Applicant\u2019s admissions and credit reports establish the debts. I find all the disqualifying \nconditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.    \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent because they are ongoing. Although he paid or settled \nthree of the debts, he failed to address the remaining debts, which comprise the majority \nof the overall debt amount. Additionally, all of the debts were not paid until after the \nissuance of Applicant\u2019s SOR in December 2021. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable. \nApplicant presented evidence that the debts were affected by circumstances \nbeyond his control, namely, his wife\u2019s legal and drug problems. However, he did not act \nresponsibly concerning the debts when he failed to resolve them in a timely fashion. AG \n\u00b6 20(b) has some application, but does not fully apply. \nApplicant presented no evidence of financial counseling. His track record to date \ndoes not support a good financial picture. Additionally, he admitted making a conscious \nchoice not to pay the debts in order to keep the statute of limitations defense available to \nhim. Based upon his past history, there is no reason to believe that he will right his \nfinancial ship in the future. While he did resolve three debts, these actions are too little, \ntoo late. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are not under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applies only to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.i, and 1.o. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s military and contractor service, and his wife\u2019s legal and \ndrug problems that led to his financial problems. However, I also considered that he has \nnot adequately addressed his delinquent debt. He has not established a meaningful track \nrecord of debt management, which causes me to question his ability to resolve his debts \nin the future. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with question and doubts about Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nhas not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a-1.f, 1.h, 1.j-1.n, 1.p: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs: 1.g, 1.i, 1.o: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On June 25, 2021, the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nE. The DCSA CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec.

He provided explanations that were tantamount to denials \nof the two allegations in the SOR. \nDepartment Counsel was ready to proceed on January 24, 2022, and the case \nwas assigned to me on September 6, 2022. Scheduling of the hearing was delayed by \ndifficulties in contacting Applicant. The case was reassigned to another administrative \njudge on November 10, 2022, and then reassigned back to me on December 15, 2022, \nwhen the assigned judge was unable to travel for medical reasons. \nOn December 27, 2022, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nnotified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for January 18, 2023. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 and 2 were admitted in evidence \nwithout objection. GX 3, an unauthenticated summary of a personal subject interview, \nwas not admitted. Applicant testified and presented the testimony of one witness. I kept \nthe record open until January 27, 2023, to enable him to submit documentary evidence. \nHe timely submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A, which was admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on January 26, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 57-year-old marine painter employed by a defense contractor since \nMarch 2018. His previous jobs, when he was not incarcerated, were all in the private \nsector. He has never married, but he has three adult children.

(GX 2.) His criminal \nrecord includes 19 arrests and charges for drug offenses, 11 felony convictions, three \nsentences for imprisonment for terms exceeding one year, and at least one sentence that \nresulted in incarceration for more than one year. \nWhen Applicant submitted his SCA in August 2018, he answered \u201cYes\u201d to the \nquestion in Section 5 asking if he had used any other names, and he listed one name that \nhe used from January 1990 to January 2000, and he explained that he used the name \nbecause of \u201cdifferent life I was living.\u201d He did not list all the aliases reflected in his criminal \nrecord. \nIn response to questions in Section 22, he answered \u201cYes\u201d to questions asking if \nhe had ever been convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment exceeding one year \nand incarcerated for not less than one year; if he had ever been charged with a felony; if \nhe ever had been charged with an offense involving firearms or explosives; or if he had \never been charged with an offense involving alcohol or drugs.

He did not list any other offenses. The criminal records do not reflect\nwhether he actually served more than one year of his other jail sentences. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant falsified his SCA by failing to list all his aliases. SOR \n\u00b6 1.b alleges that he falsified his SCA by failing to disclose his arrests for firearms charges \nand drug offenses, felony convictions, and sentences to imprisonment for more than one \nyear. The SOR does not allege any security concerns under Guideline H (Drug \nInvolvement and Substance Misuse) or Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). \nApplicant testified that he began using drugs around 1984, and he became \naddicted to heroin around 1990. (Tr. 34.) After he was released from prison in April 2010, \nhe went back to his old neighborhood and same friends and resumed his drug abuse. In \nNovember 2010, he was encouraged by his then fianc\u00e9e to change his environment. He \nentered an 11-month drug program and then joined Narcotics Anonymous (NA). He now \nattends NA meetings three or four times a week. He has a sponsor, who has been drug-\nfree for 23 years. He became a sponsor about a year ago. He testified that he does not \nremember everything he has done, but he knows that it was wrong. He is hoping for an \nopportunity to progress in his career and be a productive member of society. (Tr. 34-37.) \nApplicant testified that he remembered being interviewed in May 2019 and being \nasked if he had any aliases and he disclosed the one he could remember. He \nremembered that the investigator confronted him with additional aliases, and he admitted \nthat he had used them. (Tr. 39-40.) He admitted that he disclosed being charged with \nonly one felony, knowing that he had been charged with many more. He testified that he \nbelieved that \u201cyou guys\u201d knew about his entire record, and he was \u201cjust trying to simplify \nit,\u201d because he knew that he would be questioned about his criminal record. He was \nnervous and intimidated at the interview with the security investigator, and he had no \n\u201cpeople skills,\u201d only \u201cstreet communication.\u201d He did not understand that when he \nsubmitted his SCA, he was required to provide specific information for each incident \ninstead of a general admission that he had been convicted of a felony and spent time in \njail. (Tr. 41-44.) \nOne of Applicant\u2019s coworkers, a quality control technician, submitted a statement \nsupporting his application for a security clearance. He states that Applicant was assigned \nto a lead position for a major program. Within weeks, his department saw an immediate \nmorale boost, timely turnovers, and a high success rate with returning projects back to \nthe Navy. His coworker states that they \u201chave rarely experienced such precise, reliable \nworkmanship and inclusiveness that [Applicant] has been able to coax out of the \nsubcontractors.\u201d (AX A.) \nApplicant presented the testimony of a witness who has known him for about 12 \nyears and participates in NA with him. The witness served on active duty in the U.S. Navy \nand is a disabled veteran. She was hired by a defense contractor as a welder in 2004, \nwas granted a security clearance, progressed to a management position, and retired in \nMay 2022. Before being hired, she was a convicted felon with a history of drug \ninvolvement. She has known Applicant and watched him grow for 12 years.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).

See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \nThe relevant disqualifying condition in this case is AG \u00b6 16(a): \n[D]eliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the Government has \nthe burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An \nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). An applicant\u2019s experience and level of education are relevant \nto determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information on a security clearance \napplication was deliberate. ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). \nApplicant\u2019s criminal record and drug involvement were not alleged in the SOR, \nindicating that the DCSA CAF believed that his drug involvement and criminal conduct \nwere mitigated by the passage of time and evidence of rehabilitation.

However, his record may be considered to assess his credibility; to evaluate \nthe evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; to consider whether \nhe has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; to decide whether a particular provision of \nthe Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or to provide evidence for a whole-person \nanalysis ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). I have considered \nApplicant\u2019s criminal record and drug involvement for these limited purposes. \nApplicant has a high school education and no experience with the security-\nclearance adjudication process. He has spent much of his life in jail, in the company of \ndrug users and drug dealers, or in low-level jobs. His completion of the SCA in 2018 \nrequired him to recall information that was eight years old. His completion of his SCA was \nencumbered by the common belief among first-time applicants that the U.S. Government \nalready knows their background or can discover it easily. His memory of his criminal \nactivity and use of aliases was also encumbered by the \u201chaze of addiction.\u201d The testimony \nof his one witness was instructive about the difficulty of accurately recalling a drug-\naddicted past. He chose to disclose one of his most serious convictions and longest jail \nsentence. \nApplicant was candid, sincere, remorseful, and credible at the hearing. I am \nsatisfied that he believed that his disclosures in his SCA were sufficient to trigger fuller \ninquiry about his past, and that he did not intend to conceal relevant information. \nAccordingly, I conclude that no disqualifying conditions under this guideline are \nestablished. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline E in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).

The \nrecord in this case closed when the transcript (Tr.) was received on February 13, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the four allegations under the drug involvement guideline, \nand the three allegations under the personal conduct guideline, without explanations. \nApplicant is 31 years old. She has been married to her second husband for two \nyears. The couple have no children. She married her first husband in February 2016, \nand divorced him in March 2017.

(GE 1 at 17; GE 3 at 4-5; GE 4; Tr. 43) \nDrug Involvement  \nSOR \u00b6 1.a \u2013 In her August 2021answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted that \nshe initially used marijuana at varying frequencies from August 2009 to June 2014, and \nlater purchased marijuana from January 2017 to August 2018. She began using \nmarijuana in August 2009 sporadically in high school in social settings. Though she \ntestified that she could not recall how many times she used the drug in high school, she \nestimated two times in her August 2019 e-QIP. She acquired the drug from her high \nschool friends. (GE 1 at 37; GE 3 at 5; Tr. 62) There is no evidence indicating that she \npurchased the drug during this period. \nIn college from 2010 to June 2014, Applicant testified that she used marijuana \nsporadically. While she could not attach a number for the times she used the drug, in \nher August 2019 e-QIP, she estimated her use as \u201ca handful of times in college.\u201d She \ntestified that she did not purchase the drug while in college. (GE 1 at 37-38; Tr. 41, 54, \n63) \nAfter graduating from the university in June 2014, and receiving her \ncommission into the USAR, Applicant stopped using marijuana because she recognized \nthe zero-tolerance policy against drug use in the U.S. Army (USA). Before receiving her \ncommission, she tested positive for marijuana in June 2014. (GE 4 at 5; Tr. 41) \nApplicant stated in her April 2020 PSI that she used marijuana two months after \nreturning from her active-duty deployment in December 2016. Anxiety and post-\ntraumatic stress syndrome (PTSD), two undiagnosed medical conditions that were \nrelated to Applicant\u2019s foreign deployment which caused sleep problems, were the \nreasons that she resumed using marijuana. She justified drug use over alcohol use \nbecause of her father\u2019s ongoing problems with alcohol; she rationalized marijuana use \nover treatment from a medical professional because of Applicant\u2019s family\u2019s risk of \naddiction. She smoked marijuana less than 12 times in 2017, and once a month in 2018 \nuntil June 2018 when she failed a drug test. She purchased the drug during this period. \n(GE 3 at 4-5; GE 4 at 5; Tr. 50-52, 54, 74) Applicant testified that after returning from \nforeign deployment, she did not resume marijuana use until June or July 2017, rather \nthan January 2017. (Tr. 49-50) In her December 2019 e-QIP, she stated that she did not \nintend to use marijuana in the future because of her discharge from the military in July \n2019 (SOR \u00b6 2.b), which helped reduce her stress and sleep problems. (GE 1 at 37-38) \nIn the same form, she admitted using marijuana while possessing a security clearance, \nbut falsely denied purchasing marijuana in the previous 7 years.

Though she had a security clearance during the entire period \ncovered by SOR \u00b6 1.b, she did not use or purchase marijuana between June 2014 to \nthe middle of 2017. She claimed she did not know that she had a security clearance \nuntil she was receiving briefings in 2015 in advance of foreign deployment in early 2016. \n(Tr. 42) She also claimed that she did not know that the e-QIP she filled out in 2011 had \na connection to her security clearance. She believed her security clearance was granted \nto her by virtue of her military status as an officer. (Tr. 42) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d \u2013 In June 2014, Applicant tested positive for marijuana based on a \nurinalysis test administered by Applicant\u2019s Army unit. She did not receive the results \nuntil 2018, when she took another urinalysis test. In the interim years, she registered \nnegative results from seven urinalysis tests between June 2014 and June 2018. (GE 4 \nat 5; Tr. 43-44) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c \u2013 In June 2018, Applicant tested positive for marijuana based on a \nurinalysis test administered by her Army unit. (GE 4 at 5) \nAfter Applicant\u2019s positive marijuana test in June 2018, she sought treatment \nfrom medical professionals, using her employer\u2019s assistance program. During five or six \nmonths of treatment, she learned different tactics to alleviate stress, such as physical \nfitness, medication techniques, and alternative communication practices. (Tr. 55-56, 78, \n86-89) \nIn her testimony, Applicant stressed that she does not intend to resume \nmarijuana use in the future. She has made positive changes in her lifestyle. She no \nlonger associates with the person she purchased the marijuana from. She does not \nassociate with any drug users or environments where drugs are used. She has provided \na statement of intent to refrain from future drug use, recognizing that any future drug \ninvolvement is grounds for revocation of eligibility for security clearance eligibility. (AE 6) \nShe and her husband plan to start a family. She is thriving in her career development. \nOne aspect of Applicant\u2019s job is counseling her employees on career development and \nsecurity issues. She emphasizes the importance of supplying truthful information on \nsecurity forms. (Tr. 57-58, 81-82) \nPersonal Conduct \nSOR \u00b6 2.a \u2013 Applicant\u2019s illegal use of marijuana between August 2009 and \n2014, and between the middle of 2017 to June 2018, while possessing a security \nclearance, demonstrates questionable judgment under the personal conduct guideline. \nSOR \u00b6 2.b \u2013 Applicant was administratively separated from USAR in July 2019 \nfor misconduct, specifically drug use.

(GE 3 at 5; \nGE 4 at 1) \nSOR \u00b6 2.c \u2013 In her October 2011 e-QIP, Applicant was asked in Section 23 of \nthe application if she had used illegal drugs in the last seven years. By answering \u201cno\u201d \nto the question, Applicant deliberately failed to disclose her marijuana use (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \nthat began on August 9, 2009. In her answer to the SOR, she admitted she falsified her \nanswer to the question. (Tr. 63-65) \nIn 2010, when Applicant was 19 years old and applying for colleges, a military \nrecruiter recommended that she not disclose her marijuana use since she aspired to be \nan officer in the military. (Tr. 38) In 2011 at age 20, after attending a Reserve Officer\u2019s \nTraining Corps (ROTC) scholarship ceremony, she went into a conference room and, \nunder the supervision of military recruiters, filled out different forms that she believed \nrelated to her ROTC scholarship and to join the military. She did not know that one of \nthose forms was a security clearance application, but she did know that information that \nshe put on 2011 security clearance application was incorrect. (Tr. 40) At the hearing, \nshe indicated that she did not know she had a security clearance until she was receiving \nbriefings in 2015 for foreign deployment in early 2016. (Tr. 42) Regardless of when \nApplicant became aware she had a security clearance, she knew in October 2011 that \nshe deliberately concealed her marijuana use as set forth in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nCharacter Evidence \nWitness A, a project manager for Applicant\u2019s employer, has had a security \nclearance since late 2017. In the last five years, he has worked with Applicant in several \nlocations. They have worked on several projects together. Witness A believes Applicant \nis honest and pleasant to work with. The adverse information in the SOR occurred many \nyears ago and does not change Witness A\u2019s favorable opinion of Applicant. Though not \nfully aware of his employer\u2019s drug policy, he is aware that using illegal drugs while \nholding a security clearance could result in loss of the clearance. (Tr. 16-22) \nWitness B works for Applicant\u2019s employer as a financial officer in the office of \nintelligence and analytics. He has had  security clearance for 10 years. He has been \nworking with her since 2018. Besides being trustworthy, Witness B praises Applicant\u2019s \nprofessional approach in evaluating a task from all angles before proceeding with a \npragmatic solution. Witness B is not aware of his employer\u2019s drug policy, but believes \nthat a person\u2019s drug use while holding security clearance must be evaluated on a case-\nby-case basis.

(AE 4 at G) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines, which should be applied \nwith common sense and the general factors of the whole-person concept. All available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, \nshould be carefully reviewed before rendering a decision. The protection of the national \nsecurity is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning \npersonnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the \nnational security.\u201d Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \napplicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d \nThe applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security \ndecision. \n6 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern under the Drug Involvement/Substance Abuse Guideline \nis set forth in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; and  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant began using marijuana in 2009. She used the drug until June 2014. \nWhen she returned from foreign deployment in the middle of 2017, she used and \npurchased the drug. Applicant\u2019s use triggers the application of AG \u00b6 25(a). Her two \npositive drug tests in June 2014 and June 2018 for marijuana fall within the purview of \nAG \u00b6 25(b). Her use of the drug involves illegal possession of a controlled substance as \ndefined by AG \u00b6 25(c). \nAG \u00b6 26. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n7 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s illegal use of marijuana lasted from 2009 to June 2014, when she \ntested positive for the drug. Her infrequent to sporadic use of the drug was aggravated \nby the fact she had a clearance during the period. While Applicant exercised good \njudgment in discontinuing marijuana use in June 2014, she resumed using the drug \nbetween June or July 2017 to June 2018, when she tested positive for marijuana a \nsecond time. During this period, Applicant not only used marijuana more than \nsporadically, but she also purchased the drug. Overall, Applicant receives limited \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 26(a) based on the absence of any drug use after June 2018. \nIn her October 2011 e-QIP (GE 2), Applicant concealed information about her \nmarijuana use. Her youthful age and decision to intentionally lie on the Government \nform extenuates the seriousness of her decision, but does not excuse it. On the other \nhand, in April 2020, June 2021, and at the February 2023 hearing, Applicant furnished \ngenerally consistent information about her drug use over the years, and the measures \nshe has taken to forego future marijuana use. \nApplicant\u2019s four-year pattern of abstinence from marijuana and all other illegal \ndrugs, is enhanced by her decision to sever her relationship with drug users and the \nenvironment that generates drug use. Her five months of treatment for stress helped her \nto develop tactics to control her stress. She and her husband have plans to increase \ntheir family. Her performance evaluations are good. Finally, she has signed a statement \nof intent to abstain from all drug involvement or face a revocation of her security \nclearance eligibility. All mitigating conditions of AG \u00b6 26(b) apply. \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 sets forth the security concerns related to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \n8 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility: \nAG \u00b6 16. Conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts \nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but \nwhich, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of \nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics \nindicating that she may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. \nThe allegations under SOR \u00b6 1 are cross-alleged under SOR \u00b6 2.a. Applicant\u2019s \ninitial marijuana use while holding a security clearance, her subsequent drug use and \npurchase of the drug while holding a clearance, and testing positive for marijuana use \non two occasions in 2014 and 2018, leading to her separation from the USAR in July \n2019, reveals an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations that show Applicant \nmay not properly safeguard classified information. AG \u00b6 16(c) applies. \nApplicant\u2019s deliberate falsification of her marijuana use from her October 2011 \ne-QIP constitutes disqualifying conduct within the meaning of AG \u00b6 16(a). \nAG \u00b6 17. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur. \n9 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply because Applicant did not make a prompt, \ngood-faith effort to correct the falsification. Any deliberate falsification during the \ncourse of a security investigation is serious. However, AG \u00b6 17(c) is resolved in \nApplicant\u2019s favor because of the passage of about ten years since the \nfalsification combined with the isolated nature of the falsification. AG \u00b6 17(d) \nwarrants full consideration in mitigation for the same reasons as discussed under \nAG \u00b6 26(b). Applicant has incorporated effective coping techniques to handle her \nstress. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the guideline for drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, and personal conduct in the context of the nine general factors of the \nwhole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nThe evidence of Applicant\u2019s use and purchase of marijuana until June 2018, \nher use of the drug while holding a security clearance between 2011 and June 2018, \nher positive test results in June 2014 and June 2018, and her concealment of \npurchasing marijuana in the last seven years from her October 2019 e-QIP, weigh \nagainst her security clearance application. \nConversely, the evidence that supports Applicant\u2019s application for security \nclearance eligibility is more persuasive. Though she concealed the purchase of \nmarijuana in October 2019, she has engaged in full disclosure of her marijuana history \nsince. There is no evidence of any drug use after June 2018. Applicant participated in \nfive months of treatment to learn and incorporate ways to handle her stress. Her \nperformance ratings for 2018, 2019, and 2021 show that she has had a good job \nperformance since 2018. Applicant\u2019s character evidence substantiates her performance \nratings and her security clearance eligibility. Judging by the totality of the evidence, \nparticularly the favorable character evidence from her colleagues and the individuals \nthat served with her during her deployment in 2016, Applicant has overcome the \n10 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________ \nsecurity concerns raised by the guideline for drug involvement and substance misuse, \nand personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

He earned an associate degree and a bachelor\u2019s degree. \nHe served in the military from 1992 to 1998 and was honorably discharged. He married \nin 1998 and divorced in 2001. He remarried in 2002 and divorced in 2020. He and his \nsecond wife adopted a child. He has physical custody of the child and does not receive \nchild support.

He has held a \nsecurity clearance since he was in the military. (Tr. 19-23; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleges four debts for mortgages obtained by Applicant and his second \nwife for rental properties. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - $31,712; 1.b $23,190; 1.c - $6,402; and 1.d -\n$3,224). Applicant testified that he had nine rental properties at one time, and his credit\nwas perfect prior to 2013. He obtained the properties from 2000 to 2013. He testified that\nthey were great investments and were inexpensive to purchase. Due to management\nissues, the properties needed maintenance. He was unable to pay for repairs. Seven of\nthe properties were not rented and were not being maintained properly. He was aware of \nthe problems because the managers were family members. He was paying approximately\n$2,000-$3,000 a month for the seven properties that were not occupied. He stopped \npaying the mortgages on the rental properties in about 2015 and they foreclosed. He said\nhe received IRS 1099-C cancelation of debt forms for two of the properties. The debts\nare all charged off.

He said he tried to \nsell the properties but was unsuccessful. He has not contacted any of the creditors and \nhas not made arrangements to resolve the delinquent loans. (Tr. 25, 52-53, 70; GE 1, 2, \n3, 4) \nIn 2013, Applicant and his second wife adopted a child who had medical issues \nthat required surgeries. He testified that he had medical insurance but not all the \nexpenses were covered.

These payments were all applied to tax year 2012. When he failed to timely pay his \n2018 taxes, the agreement became null and void.

He said he was unsuccessful. He has attempted \nto contact the IRS since 2018 and has been unsuccessful.

He has not hired anyone but he intends to reach out to them again. \nHis plan for the future is to negotiate with the IRS to resolve the debt. He has not contacted \nthe IRS to begin this process.

It does not reflect current information\nfor tax year 2020. Applicant testified that he believes he owes approximately $2,500 for\ntax year 2020. He intends to pay it.

(Tr. 72-92) \nAny derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered \nfor disqualifying purposes. It may be considered in the application of mitigating conditions, \nin making a credibility determination, and in a whole-person analysis. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of ability to do so;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant is indebted to the federal government for delinquent taxes in the amount \nof at least $186,878. He also has approximately $64,528 of charged-off mortgage debt. \nWhen his rental properties were no longer profitable, he essentially abandoned the \nmortgage debts and does not intend to resolve them, expecting the creditors to recoup \ntheir losses elsewhere. He has repeatedly knowingly failed to pay his federal income \ntaxes for tax years 2013 to 2018. There is sufficient evidence to support the application \nof the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the\nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit\ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control;  \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant purchased nine rental properties and when some were no longer \nprofitable, he abandoned his responsibilities to pay the mortgages. He has not made any \neffort to resolve them, expecting the creditors to recoup their losses through the \nforeclosure process. Applicant failed to pay his federal income taxes for tax years 2013 \nto 2018 and owes at least $186,878. He attributed his tax problems to paying medical \nexpenses for his daughter. He said his out-of-pocket expenses were about $2,000 a year. \nAt one point in 2018, he made an agreement with the IRS to resolve his tax debt and he \nmade a few payments, but after there was some confusion about his 2018 tax debt, he \nnever made a new agreement with the IRS. He has made sporadic payments to the IRS. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are ongoing and recent. Although his daughter\u2019s \nmedical expenses may have initially impacted his finances, there is scant evidence that \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nApplicant made efforts to have income withheld from his pay to cover his yearly tax debts. \nHe had an agreement with the IRS at one point, but then stopped making payments when \nthere was some confusion. Based on his testimony, he has some expendable income he \ncould use to address his tax debt, and he will occasionally make a payment, which he \nprovided a document to show. Applicant has not acted responsibly toward his debts. He \nhas not participated in financial counseling. An occasional payment toward his tax debt \ndoes not constitute a good-faith effort to resolve his tax debts. He does not have an \narrangement with the IRS to resolve his large tax debt. Applicant\u2019s conduct casts doubt \non his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. None of the mitigating conditions \napply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nDespite being aware that he had an obligation to plan for his tax liability, Applicant \nrepeatedly failed to do so. His failure to responsibly address his delinquent tax debt is a \nconcern. The DOHA Appeal Board has held that: \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 42 years old. He was previously married from July 2012 until January 2017 and has no children. He has attended some college courses but has not earned a degree. Since approximately November 2016, he has been employed full time as a migration engineer for a DOD contractor. (Tr. 23-25, 105-106; GE 1) At the hearing, Applicant admitted he ingests marijuana using a vape device on an almost daily basis, and he used it the night before the hearing. He uses marijuana because it helps him tolerate food, and he uses it as a sleep aid. He intends to continue to use marijuana in this manner and with this frequency, notwithstanding its impact on his clearance eligibility. He has not disclosed his marijuana use to anyone other than his physicians and his father. Additionally, no one at his company is aware of his past or ongoing use of marijuana. He first used marijuana recreationally in 2005. He did not use it between 2005 and 2012. In approximately 2012, he obtained a medical marijuana card/marijuana prescription after his hip surgeries and his gastroparesis diagnosis. His medical marijuana card expired in 2013, and he never renewed it.

I was assigned this case on December 2, 2021. I initiated contact \nwith Applicant on January 6, 2022, and he indicated he was represented by counsel; \nhowever, due to COVID-related issues, Applicant\u2019s counsel was unable to enter his \nappearance until January 25, 2022. DOHA issued a notice on March 25, 2022, for a \nhearing set for April 12, 2022.

(HE I; Tr. 12-13, 138-139) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 42 years old. He was previously married from July 2012 until January \n2017 and has no children. He has attended some college courses but has not earned a \ndegree. Since approximately November 2016, he has been employed full time as a \nmigration engineer for a DOD contractor. (Tr. 23-25, 105-106; GE 1) \nAt the hearing, Applicant admitted he ingests marijuana using a vape device on an \nalmost daily basis, and he used it the night before the hearing. He uses marijuana \nbecause it helps him tolerate food, and he uses it as a sleep aid. He intends to continue \nto use marijuana in this manner and with this frequency, notwithstanding its impact on his \nclearance eligibility. He has not disclosed his marijuana use to anyone other than his \nphysicians and his father. Additionally, no one at his company is aware of his past or \nongoing use of marijuana. He first used marijuana recreationally in 2005. He did not use \nit between 2005 and 2012. In approximately 2012, he obtained a medical marijuana \ncard/marijuana prescription after his hip surgeries and his gastroparesis diagnosis. His \nmedical marijuana card expired in 2013, and he never renewed it. (Tr. 78, 81-84, 94-104, \n108-111, 118, 121, 124-125; GE 1) \nIn January 2017, Applicant certified and submitted his first Electronic \nQuestionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). Under Section 23, he responded \n\u201cNO\u201d to the following query, \u201cIn the last seven (7) years, have you illegally used any drugs \nor controlled substances?\u201d (Tr. 106-107; GE 2) \nIn July 2018, Applicant certified and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 85P for \nPublic Trust Positions. Under question 10, he responded \u201cNO\u201d to the following query, \u201cIn \nthe last seven (7) years, have you illegally used any drugs or controlled substances?\u201d The \nSOR did not allege that Applicant falsified this document, and his response will not be \nconsidered disqualifying conduct. (Tr. 107-108; GE 3) \nIn June 2020, Applicant completed a second e-QIP, and under Section 23, he \ndisclosed that between June 2005 and June 2020, he had used \u201cTHC, (Such as \nmarijuana, weed, pot, hashish, etc.\u201d His use was related to treating conditions and \nsymptoms for a medical condition.

He \nconfirmed that the information he disclosed in his 2020 e-QIP regarding his drug was \naccurate. Additionally, he stated that he intended to continue to use marijuana to alleviate \nthe symptoms of his medical condition. He claimed he obtained marijuana through a \nprescription from his physician. (GE 4) \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer, he admitted to deliberately omitting or falsifying information \nabout his illegal drug use on his January 2017 e-QIP but provided no explanation. \nHowever, at the hearing, he testified that he did not disclose his marijuana use in his 2017 \ne-QIP and 2018 SF 85P, because he considered his use of marijuana to be legal under \napplicable state laws, and he was not intentionally trying to hide it. He disclosed marijuana \nuse in his 2020 e-QIP, because he was under the impression, at that time, that because \nhe was required to sign a medical release form through his employer, his company was \ngoing to be able to review his medical records and would learn that he was using medical \nmarijuana. (Tr. 76-81, 108-110; GE 1-3) \nAfter the SOR was issued, Applicant did not approach his physicians for legal \nmedical alternatives for his illegal marijuana use. When questioned at the hearing \nregarding his company\u2019s policy regarding drug use, he responded, \u201cI can\u2019t think of what it \nis, recite it off the top of my head, but I\u2019m pretty sure that they don\u2019t want you [to] do any \nillegal drugs.\u201d When asked to clarify if his company considers marijuana to be an illegal \ndrug, he responded, \u201cI\u2019m not sure if they do or not.\u201d He did not ask for clarification, \nbecause it is his medical information. He is not subject to drug testing at work.  (Tr. 111-\n112, 120) \nApplicant testified that he is aware that marijuana use is illegal under federal law, \nand the following dialogue at the hearing indicates he is fully aware that his use of \nmarijuana is prohibited by DOD regulations for individuals holding public trust positions. \nApplicant\u2019s Attorney: Have you ever used marijuana with anybody at work? \nApplicant: No. \nApplicant\u2019s Attorney: Has it ever come up as a topic any time, anywhere for \nany reason? \nApplicant: Absolutely not, Jesus Christ. \nApplicant\u2019s Attorney: Okay \nApplicant: I like having my job. \nApplicant\u2019s Counsel: [Y]ou felt it was appropriate and go ahead and disclose \nyour medical use? \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant: I didn\u2019t think I had much of a choice.

He is a physician, specializing in palliative care and \nrehabilitative medicine, and he has a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in medical geography. \nAccording to EW, marijuana use should be decriminalized, and it should no longer be a \nSchedule I drug, despite its federal classification, as it has it has medicinal benefits. \nMedical marijuana was legalized in Applicant\u2019s state of residence in 1999, and its \nrecreational use was legalized in 2012. (Tr. 29-70; AE A; AE B) \nEW does not treat Applicant, nor has Applicant ever been his patient. EW \nconducted a \u201cmostly\u201d remote telephonic 73-minute examination of Applicant, a couple of \nfollow-up calls, and reviewed Applicant\u2019s medical record from August 2015 and his \nprescription history detailed in AE C. Based upon these data points, WE concluded that \nApplicant has a \u201cdiagnosable condition that could and would potentially benefit from \nmedical cannabis use\u201d to wit, gastroparesis, as there are limited prescriptions available \nto treat this affliction, and Applicant has not tolerated them well. WE testified that he does \nnot believe that Applicant\u2019s use of medical marijuana affects his trustworthiness. (Tr. 30-\n70; AE A-C)\n \n \n \nApplicant presented briefs regarding the historical laws criminalizing the use of \nmarijuana; the medical use of marijuana; the legalization of marijuana by various states; \nthe medical necessity defense; marijuana\u2019s status as a Schedule I drug; and three \nAttorney General memos from 2009 to 2013 regarding the enforcement of the Controlled \nSubstances Act concerning marijuana. (AE D-H; See also GE 5) \nApplicant does not feel that his marijuana use affects his ability to be trustworthy \nor his job performance, which has been \u201cusually above satisfactory.\u201d He is currently \nmanaging \u201can entire group\u201d which consists of approximately 27 workers. He enjoys his \njob and wants to continue to work for his company. (Tr. 73, 87-94) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nPositions designated as ADP I/II/III are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.) \u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . \nassignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s \nloyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive \nduties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See Regulation \u00b6 \nC6.1.1.1.)

[And see also \u00b6 D.8 and E.1 for similar language] \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nAdministrative Guidelines (AG) \u00b6 2 (a). These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The Applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable trustworthiness \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nMarijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance under federal law pursuant to Title \n21, Section 812 of the United States Code. Schedule I drugs are those which have a high \npotential for abuse; have no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United \nStates; and lack accepted safety for use of the drug under medical supervision. Section \n844 under Title 21 of the United States Code makes it unlawful for any person to \nknowingly or intentionally possess a controlled substance not obtained pursuant to a valid \nprescription. \nOn October 25, 2014, the then Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued \nguidance that changes to laws by some states and the District of Columbia to legalize or \ndecriminalize the recreational use of marijuana do not alter existing federal law or the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines, and that an individual\u2019s disregard of federal \nlaw pertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively \nrelevant in national security eligibility determinations. \nMoreover, on December 21, 2021, the current DNI issued clarifying guidance \nconcerning marijuana, noting that prior recreational use of marijuana by an individual may \nbe relevant to security adjudications, but is not determinative in the whole-person \nevaluation. Relevant factors in mitigation include the frequency of use and whether the \nindividual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant illegally used and possessed marijuana on many occasions between \n2005 and August 2020. He has used marijuana on numerous occasions since holding a \nposition of trust in 2017, and he repeatedly expressed his intent to continue to use \nmarijuana. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), 25(f), and 25(g) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the drug involvement security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 26. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant repeatedly expressed his intent to continue to use marijuana, with the \nfull knowledge that his use of marijuana violates federal laws and DOD regulations for \npublic trust holders. He appears to understand the gravity of his decision and its impact \non his public trust position eligibility. Applicant did not mitigate the drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse concerns arising from his past and continued marijuana use, including \nwhile holding a public trust position. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. The following disqualifying condition applies in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nOn Applicant\u2019s January 2017 e-QIP, he omitted his illegal use of marijuana. He \nreported this illegal drug use on his June 2020 e-QIP and affirmed these admissions \nduring his August 2020 interview. He admitted his falsifications in his Answer, but denied \nfalsifying his e-QIP at the hearing. Based upon the totality of the evidence, including his \ncontinued concealment of his marijuana use; his fear of losing his job; and the basis for \nhis 2020 disclosure (he thought his use would be revealed in a review of his medical \nrecords); I find that Applicant\u2019s omission was deliberate, and he falsified his 2017 e-QIP. \nAG \u00b6 16(a) applies. \nThe following personal conduct mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially \nrelevant: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts. \nApplicant\u2019s falsification on his January 2017 e-QIP raises serious concerns about \nhis judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. He failed to disclose his illegal marijuana \nuse in his July 2018 SF 85P as well. He testified that he disclosed his drug use in his \n2020 e-QIP, because he believed his company would discover his use when it reviewed \nhis medical records. Although he continued to volunteer information regarding his drug \nuse in his August 2020 interview and at the hearing, his failure to take responsibility for \nfalsifying his 2017 e-QIP and 2018 SF 85P at the hearing, after admitting to falsifying his \n2017 e-QIP in his Answer, leaves me with ongoing concerns as to his credibility and \nforthrightness; therefore, he does not receive full mitigation credit in the context of AG \u00b6 \n17(a). Applicant did not sufficiently mitigate the personal conduct security concerns \narising from his e-QIP falsification. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):\n \n \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case, including Applicant\u2019s significant and debilitating medical condition. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a public trust position. He has used marijuana daily for the past \nten years, over four of which while holding a public trust position, and he intends to \ncontinue to illegally use marijuana. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising from his past and current use of marijuana \nand his failure to be honest and forthcoming about this use. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is not clearly consistent with national security to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \npublic trust position. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \nCaroline E. Heintzelman \nAdministrative Judge \n10 \n",

He offered that he had been limiting myself to approximately one beer per \nhour, based a guideline he learned after his 2013 DUI and then \u201cwaited a little under an \nhour after finishing\u201d his last beer before he left. He states he struck a parked vehicle while \nattempting to pull up a navigation application while driving. The police responded to the \naccident, and he was administered a field sobriety test, which he passed. The police \ndetected the odor of alcohol on him, and he was arrested on suspicion of DUI. A \nbreathalyzer was administered at the police station and the test generated a blood alcohol \nlevel of 0.12 or 0.13. (Item 5 at 3.) He was charged with Illegal Operation of a Moving \nVehicle While Under the Influence of Alcohol and Failure to Drive Upon Right. He reported \nthe DUI arrest to his security officer. He successfully completed the court-ordered alcohol \neducation classes and the ignition interlock requirement without issue. (AE at 6 and AE \nat 7.) With the successful completion of the alcohol education course, the charges were \ndismissed in May 2020.

He reiterates that under no circumstances does he operate motor vehicles \nif he has been drinking. (Item 2 at 2.)

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information.

Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is detailed in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe following are potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 22: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nand \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant consumed alcohol, at times in excess and to the point \nof intoxication, since about March 2013 to the present. SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges Applicant\u2019s \narrest and conviction of DUI in January 2008, and SOR \u00b6 1.c alleges Applicant\u2019s arrest \nfor DUI in September 2017 and his subsequent conviction in June 2019. Applicant \nadmitted all the SOR allegations. The above AGs apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 23: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nAG \u00b6 23(a) is established. The first prong of AG \u00b6 23(a) (\u201cso much time has \npassed\u201d) focuses on whether the conduct was recent. There are no bright line rules for \ndetermining when conduct is recent. The determination must be based on a careful \nevaluation of the totality of the evidence. If the evidence shows a significant period of time \nhas passed without any evidence of misconduct, then an administrative judge must \ndetermine whether that period of time demonstrates changed circumstances or conduct \nsufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.

He successfully \ncompleted his alcohol treatment program in 2020 resulting in an Alcohol Education \nDismissal of his charges. His two DUI arrests were more than five years apart. In his \nanswer to the SOR, he stated that he moderated his alcohol consumption after his DUI \nconviction in 2018, and no longer operates a motor vehicle if he has been drinking. The \nevidence is sufficient to establish reform or rehabilitation. \nAG \u00b6 23(b) is established. Applicant has acknowledged his maladaptive alcohol \nuse. He provided evidence of counseling and treatment after his second DUI conviction. \nHis answer to the SOR indicates that he has matured and intends to moderate his alcohol \nconsumption but not to abstain. There is sufficient time and evidence to determine that \nhe will adhere to his statements of moderate consumption and proper behavior after \ndrinking to show a \u201cclear and established pattern of modified consumption.\u201d \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 23(c) and 23(d) are applicable. Applicant provided evidence he received \ncounseling and treatment after his most recent DUI conviction and that he had \nsuccessfully completed the treatment program. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline G in my whole-person analysis. Applicant reported his 2018 DUI incident to his \nsecurity officer. He has also provided two letters of recommendation. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline G and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigated the security concerns raised by his alcohol-related conduct.

He mitigated the security concerns under Guideline E, personal conduct. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 26, 2021, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued to Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations and Guideline E, personal conduct. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nIn an undated answer to the SOR, Applicant requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. This case was assigned to me on December 14, 2022. The notice \nof hearing was issued on January 6, 2023, scheduling the hearing for January 30, 2023. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant requested a continuance, which I granted, and the notice of hearing was issued \non February 9, 2023, setting the hearing for March 22, 2023. I convened the hearing as \nrescheduled. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 9. Applicant testified and \noffered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through R. There were no objections to any exhibits, \nand all were admitted in evidence. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March \n31, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations except \u00b6 1.a. Applicant\u2019s admissions \nare incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 53 years old. He earned an associate degree in 2017. He served on \nactive duty in the military from 1993 until he was medically retired in 2017. He has three \nchildren from a former girlfriend. They are 28 and twins who are 17 years old. He pays \n$1,000 a month in child support for the minors, which he has paid since 1995. He married \nin 1997. He has one stepdaughter who is 27 years old and six children with his wife \nbetween the ages of 25 and 10. They all live at home. After retiring from the military, he \nhad two jobs at retail stores. He also worked for a federal contractor on a short-term \ncontract. He was hired full time by the contractor in April 2019. He has been working on \nthe same project since then, but the contractor has changed. (Tr. 18-22, 30, 58-63, 90-\n92, 99-102, 106) \nApplicant has an extensive deployment history while serving in the military. He \ndeployed eight times. He had four combat deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2007, \nhe suffered a concussion after being knocked unconscious when his platoon was hit by \nan improvised explosive device. Numerous soldiers were injured and there were two \nfatalities. He chose to stay with his platoon and not evacuate. He continues to suffer from \nbalance issues. Applicant also deployed to Macedonia twice, Bosnia, and Kosovo. (Tr. \n22-29; AE A) \nApplicant suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and had other \nmedical issues when he was discharged from the military. His veteran\u2019s disability rating \nis 100%. He admits he was in denial for a long time with regards to his PTSD. He had \nsuicidal ideations in 2008. He has been on medication since 2008. He was hospitalized \ntwice so his medication could be monitored and adjusted. Since 2017, he has been seeing \na counselor monthly. It was recommended he attend grief counseling, but he does not \nfeel capable of doing so. He acknowledges that his PTSD caused him to have mood \nswings and sometimes he was agitated. (Tr. 29-36, 93-99; AE J, K, L) \nApplicant testified that he has had financial problems since he got married. \nApplicant\u2019s wife was responsible for handling the finances while he was in the military due \nto his frequent deployments. In the early 2000s, Applicant\u2019s identity was stolen. \nApparently, at some point, that issue was resolved. (Tr. 36-38) \n2 \n\nApplicant testified that in 2014, he took over being responsible for his finances. He \nand his wife had separated. He did not review his credit reports. He said he contacted the \ncreditors from whom he received letters. Applicant attended financial counseling through \nthe military in 2015. He was told to contact his delinquent creditors and make payment \narrangements. He said he could not afford to make payments. He sought assistance twice \nthrough the military emergency relief fund. Usually this is not available to a \nnoncommissioned officer, but exceptions were made for him. He was also asking for \nassistance from family members. He testified that he was paying some debts at that time, \nbut others had been sold to different creditors, and he got lost in attempting to determine \nthe current creditor. He claimed he disputed some debts, but never was contacted by the \ncreditor. He did not provide any documentary evidence to support his actions. (Tr. 37-40, \n87-88, 103-105) \nApplicant testified that in 2016 and 2017 he was still struggling financially and was \naware that he had delinquent accounts. He had received letters from creditors about the \ndelinquent accounts. He separated from the military in early 2017. Part of the separation \nprocess is to attend financial counseling. Applicant stated he attended the counseling and \nunderstood the issues he needed to address. He said he contacted creditors and began \nmaking payments, but they wanted to increase the amounts, and he could not afford it. \n(Tr. 38-40, 102, 104) \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in July 2019. He did \nnot disclose any delinquent debts. The SOR alleges 13 debts totaling approximately \n$13,692. These debts are reported on credit reports from August 2019, February 2021, \nMay 2021, and January 2023. Many of the debts dropped off the more recent credit \nreports due to age. Applicant did not pay any of them. (GE 3, 4, 5, 9; AE B) \nApplicant testified that he was aware of some of the debts alleged in the SOR \nbecause he was receiving notices from the creditors. He testified that, when he admitted \nthe debts on the SOR, he was acknowledging they were on his credit report, not that he \nowed them. He said he did not recognize many of the debts. (Tr. 38-40, 51-53) \nIn November 2019, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in \nconnection with his SCA. He acknowledged to the investigator that he had financial \nissues. He was confronted with many of the debts alleged in the SOR. The only account \nfor which he offered an explanation was one owed to a landlord (SOR \u00b6 1.a), which he \ndisputed. The landlord claimed he owed money for damages when he vacated the \nresidence. Applicant continues to dispute that debt, but it remains on his most recent \ncredit report. He explained to the investigator that he did not plan to satisfy his delinquent \ndebts because he cannot afford to pay them because he is caring for ten children and \npaying child support. He testified that he received a promotion and now has more \nresources with which to pay his debts. He admitted that due to the age of many of the \ndebts they likely have fallen off of his credit report because they are older than seven \nyears and not because they were paid. (Tr. 41-50 186, 188-191; GE 2) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife received an inheritance from her father when he passed away. \nApplicant believed it was about a year ago. He testified that she receives money each \nmonth from the inheritance. She does not use the money to help Applicant resolve the \ndelinquent debts. He does not know the total amount of the inheritance or the amount of \nthe monthly payments. He will not ask his wife how much it is because it will result in an \nargument. He will not ask her to help him pay the debts they accumulated. She does not \nuse the money to help him financially. They purchased a $415,000 house in December \n2022. She made the down payment, but he does not know that amount. His monthly \nmortgage payment is $3,400. He has two car loans for which he pays approximately \n$1,300 monthly. (Tr. 54-58, 115-121) \nIn March 2023, Applicant signed an agreement with CC, a credit consolidation \nservice. He testified he receives financial counseling through the service, which is part of \nthe agreement. He also has a payment agreement that requires he pay $384 a month to \naddress seven debts, including the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b61.a and 1.b. No other SOR \ndelinquent debts are included in this payment plan. Applicant is required to make his first \npayment in April 2023. He believes the agreement extends for four to five years. Applicant \nprovided no other evidence of his plan or intention to resolve the remaining debts alleged \nin the SOR. He said he will continue to pay on the agreement with CC so he can keep his \nclearance. (Tr. 50-54, 121; AE B, C) \nAs part of the agreement with CC, Applicant provided a budget, which reflects his \nmonthly income and expenses. His income includes his military retirement, his salary from \nhis employer, and his disability payment. The original budget prepared by CC reflects a \ndeficit of $102 a month. An adjusted budget, with revised amounts to be paid to \nApplicant\u2019s creditors, reflects zero disposable income. Applicant explained that the \namount of $900 for miscellaneous expenses was too high and that would allow him more \ndisposable income. (Tr. 54, 123-127; AE C) \nNoted on Applicant\u2019s budget was a $100 payment to the IRS. He explained that \nthere was a period in 2014 when he and his wife were separated. He filed his income tax \nreturns as single and not jointly. He continues to file his tax returns as single. He owed \nthe IRS taxes and made payment arrangements. He testified he has had an installment \nagreement since 2016. He believed his original balance owed was approximately $7,000 \nand the current balance is around $3,000. He said the IRS captures any refunds for \nsubsequent tax years and applies them to his tax debt. It is unknown if he owed taxes for \nother tax years. (Tr. 132-135, 187; AE C) \nAfter receiving the SOR in July 2021, Applicant has not contacted any of the \ncreditors in the SOR. He said he was generally aware the delinquent debts existed, but \nhe could not afford to pay them. (Tr. 115, 136-137) \nIn September 2010, while serving on active duty, Applicant was charged under the \nUniform Codes of Military Justice Article 120-wrongful sexual contact and Article 93-\ncruelty and maltreatment. Applicant was accused of wrongfully touching the breast and \nkissing the ear of one of his subordinate soldiers. Applicant testified that he went to a \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \ncourt-martial but did not know if it was a Special Court-Martial or General Court-Martial. \nHe was represented by a judge advocate. He said he took the stand in his defense, and \nit was a members trial. He said before the case was sent to the members, and while he \nwas on the witness stand, the military judge summoned both the trial and defense counsel \nto the bench and dismissed the charges. Documentary evidence corroborates that there \nwas an investigation conducted regarding the alleged incident and the charges were \nreported to the FBI and it is included in their records system. No other supporting \ndocuments from the court-martial were submitted. He denied the incident ever took place \nand denied the charges. (Tr. 64-71, 137-153; GE 2, 6, 7) \nApplicant explained the incident to the government investigator and testified about \nit at his hearing. He stated that one of his female soldiers that was part of a specialized \ngroup of women who deployed with units in combat so they could speak to local women, \nrequested to be transferred so she could be at a location where her husband was also in \ncountry. He stated she was the best soldier of the four-women group and the platoon had \nan upcoming mission, and she was essential. He denied her request. He said she then \nwent outside the chain of command without telling him and her request was also denied \nwhen the commander asked for input regarding her request. Applicant believes the soldier \naccused him of the offenses in retaliation for his denial of her request. He was \nsubsequently moved to a different unit. (GE 2) \nApplicant provided a letter from a major who was a young lieutenant in 2010 and \nserved with him. There was no mention of the court-martial incident, but the major noted \nhow invaluable Applicant was to the unit. He explained their time together was physically \nand emotionally challenging noting the loss of two platoon members and the evacuation \nof three others in the first ninety days. The major commented on how important Applicant \nwas to the platoon ensuring they all remained focused on the mission. The major said as \na young lieutenant, he learned valuable lessons from Applicant that were transformational \nin how he approached leadership jobs he has had in the military. He considers him \nreliable, candid, and trustworthy. They have kept in contact over the years. He \nrecommended Applicant be granted a security clearance. (GE 2, 7; AE N) \nIn September 2014, Applicant was arrested and charged with domestic violence \nand harassment. Applicant admitted he was angry with his wife, and he was yelling at \nher, calling her names, and throwing things. This started when she picked him up in the \ncar with the children. He was hitting the dashboard and yelling. The confrontation \ncontinued in the house. He admitted there was a confrontation, but he was vague about \nthe incident. During his hearing, he repeatedly stated he could not remember aspects of \nthe incident. He was able to recall that his wife had hit him, and that he pushed her to \nmove her away from the door that she was blocking. He admitted that his PTSD has \ncaused him to have impulse control issues that have triggers. He does not know what the \ntriggers are but he can feel them coming on. He left the house, and his wife called the \npolice. He was going to stay at a friend\u2019s house. He was arrested on his way there. He \nand his wife separated. (Tr. 71-83, 153-165; GE 8; AE D, E, F) \n5 \n\n \n \n \nIn October 2014, Applicant\u2019s stepdaughter, the oldest child in the house, reported \nto the police that Applicant had indecently exposed himself to her. He was arrested and \ncharged with indecent exposure. She alleged that he was scratching himself and exposed \nhis penis and testicles. Applicant admitted he was scratching himself, but it was on top of \nhis clothing and his genitals were not exposed. (Tr. 75-83; GE 8) \nReports from the county sheriff confirm the above two arrests. Applicant\u2019s FBI \nreport also reflects a charge for harassment in September 2014 and indecent exposure \nin October 2014. In December 2014, Applicant entered a pretrial diversion program to \nadjudicate the harassment charge. He was required to plead guilty to the charge and \ncomplete a domestic violence program. Applicant completed the terms of the agreement \nand in February 2015, the order entered stated the parties had reconciled and the charge \nwas dismissed. (Tr. 165-166; GE 6, 8; AE D, E, F, G) \nApplicant testified regarding the indecent exposure charge that at the time of his \ncase, the judge called each of his children into his chambers and spoke with them \npersonally. Applicant was not privy to their conversation. He testified that after the judge \nspoke to each child the charge was dismissed. Applicant said he never discussed the \nallegation again and put it behind him. He believes his stepdaughter was angry about the \ndomestic violence incident, so she falsely accused him of the offense. He believes she \nrecanted her allegation to the judge. No other evidence was provided except the police \nreport and that it was entered into the FBI system. (Tr. 75-83, 166-172; GE 6, 8) \nApplicant testified that he and his spouse remain married and their seven children \nall still reside at home. The older ones have jobs and receive some money from an \ninheritance. He began therapy in 2018 for his PTSD. He has learned some coping \nmechanisms. His therapist recommended marriage counseling. He said they attended \none family counseling session and went to marriage counseling twice. He stated that he \nand his wife do not believe in marriage counseling, and it did not work out for them. (Tr. \n179-185) \nIn April 2019, Applicant was fired from his employment at a big retail store where \nhe worked as a loss prevention employee. He observed a person shoplifting. It is the \nstore\u2019s policy not to physically restrain people observed shoplifting. Applicant was aware \nof the policy. After observing a shoplifter, he contacted his two managers, and confronted \nthe person who refused to stop. He and the managers escorted the person to an office. \nThe person attempted to leave, and a manager blocked the door and there was a scuffle \nwith the manager. Applicant stated he felt a sense of duty to come to the aid of the \nmanager who was asking for help. He testified that he knew the policy not to physically \ntouch a person, but he felt it was the right thing to do to help the manager when he \nrequested help. He grabbed the person, pulled him off the manager, and forcibly placed \nhim on a bench. The office door was then opened, and the person rushed to leave when \nhe was met by police. Applicant was fired the next day for violating store policy. The two \nmanagers were fired from that store but were relocated to a different store. Applicant \ntestified that the store manager who had fired him wanted to rehire him, but he already \nhad a new job. (Tr. 84-87, 172-179) \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThroughout the hearing, Applicant repeatedly could not remember or recall many \nfacts. His veteran\u2019s disability rating does not reflect a traumatic brain injury or other issues \nassociated with memory loss. Although some of his memory issues may be attributed to \nhis PTSD, as to some, he appeared more evasive and not entirely forthcoming. \nApplicant provided his enlisted record and performance evaluation from 2016; \ndocuments from the Department of Veterans Affairs; a list of medications he is prescribed; \nhis resume; an article about service in Macedonia; award certificates; training certificates; \nand photographs of him and his family. Also submitted was a letter from his wife, a \ncharacter letter mentioned previously from his former lieutenant (now major), and a letter \nfrom the director of the office where he presently works. The director stated that \nApplicant\u2019s work is top-notch and there has never been a security incident. His work ethic, \nattention to detail, and personal behavior are among the most professional he has \nobserved in his 32 years of federal service. (AE H-R) \nApplicant was awarded the following personal awards: Bronze Star; Meritorious \nService Medal; Army Commendation Medal (five awards); Army Achievement Medal (six \nawards) Joint Meritorious Unit Citation; Presidential Unit Citation (two awards); NATO \nMedal and the Combat Medical Badge. He also earned numerous campaign and other \nribbons. (AE A, AE P) \nAny derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered \nfor disqualifying purposes, but may be considered when making a credibility \ndetermination, in applying mitigating conditions, and in a whole-person analysis. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \n7 \n\n \n \n \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n8 \n\n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a long history of financial issues and has accumulated delinquent \ndebts for many years. Despite being aware for many years of the debts, he indicated he \ndid not have the money to pay them and did not intend to pay them. The debts alleged in \nthe SOR remain unresolved. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve it. \nApplicant has a long history of financial issues. None of the delinquent debts \nalleged in the SOR have been resolved. They are recent and ongoing. He has been aware \nof these debts and financial obligations for many years. He said his wife handled the \nfinances while he was deployed and in the service, but in 2014 he took over handling his \nfinances. He has been retired from the military since 2017. He receives retirement pay, \ndisability pay, and a salary from his job. He was interviewed by a government investigator \nin 2019, and he said he did not have the money to pay his debts and did not intend to do \nso. Perhaps while he was in the service and was deployed numerous times, the \n9 \n\n \n \ncircumstances that caused his financial problems were beyond his control. However, that \nhas not been the case since at least 2014. I cannot find that future financial problems are \nunlikely to recur. His indifference to his finances raises additional concerns. He received \nthe SOR in July 2021 and it was not until March 2023 that he entered into a payment plan \nto address some of his debts, but only two were from the SOR. \nApplicant has received financial counseling several times, including most recently \nwith his enrollment in a payment program. However, there is insufficient evidence to \nconclude there are clear indications that his problem is resolve or under control \nconsidering he has received financial counseling in the past but did not follow through on \nthe advice, and he did not include most of the SOR debts in his payment plan. In addition, \nat the time of hearing, he had not made his first payment on his payment plan with CC. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20 (c) and 20(d) do not apply. \nApplicant may have a legitimate dispute with the landlord and debt alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.a. However, he did not provide documented evidence of his attempt to dispute it or \nresolve it. The debt is included in his payment plan, but that has not been executed yet \nand it is premature to conclude it is being resolved. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concerns for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility: \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \n10 \n\nforeign intelligence entity or other individual group. Such conduct includes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s personal, \nprofessional, or community standing. \nThere is substantial evidence that in 2010 while serving in the military, Applicant \nwas charged with wrongful sexual contact, and cruelty and maltreatment; that he was \narrested and charged in September 2014 with domestic violence-harassment; that he \nwas arrested and charged with indecent exposure in October 2014; and that he was fired \nfrom his employment in April 2019 for physically restraining a customer in violation of the \ncompany\u2019s policy. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to prove mitigation. The following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable to the disqualifying security concerns \nbased on the facts: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nThe evidence supports that Applicant was charged with wrongful sexual contact, \nand cruelty and maltreatment. He went to a court-martial, but the results of trial were not \nprovided. He stated the charges were dismissed and based on the lack of evidence to the \ncontrary they likely were. He denied he committed the offenses. This alleged incident took \nplace more than 13 years ago. So much time has elapsed, and it happened under unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur. Applicant continued to serve, deploy, retire, and \nreceived an honorable discharge. AG \u00b6 17(c) applies. \nApplicant was suffering from PTSD after returning from multiple combat \ndeployments. He had a domestic altercation with his wife. He admits the altercation and \nthat he was somewhat out of control at the time. The domestic violence charges were \ndismissed when he completed the terms of a deferred prosecution, which included \ndomestic violence class and anger management classes. He separated from his wife for \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \na time, and they reconciled. His stepdaughter accused him of indecent exposure. He \ncredibly testified that the judge questioned each of his seven children separately and then \nthe charge was dismissed. I do not have any evidence to show the case was otherwise \nadjudicated. Applicant said that the incident has never been spoken about. He believed \nhis stepdaughter was retaliating against him due to the domestic violence incident. I \nbelieve there was enough evidence at the time for the police to charge him and they did \nso. AG \u00b6 17(f) does not apply. However, Applicant has been in regular counseling, which \ncontinues presently, and has not had any other incidents since 2014. He has learned \ncoping skills. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d) and 17(e) apply. \nApplicant failed to follow company policy when he physically restrained a shoplifter \nwhere he was employed. The evidence supports that this incident happened under unique \ncircumstances. Although it was against company policy, Applicant was responding to a \nplea for help from his manager who was grappling with the suspect, which was likely how \nmost people would respond. It has been almost four years since this incident, and it does \nnot cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b617(c) \napplies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI have considered Applicant\u2019s extraordinary service to our country in combat \noperations, numerous deployments, and commitment to his fellow soldiers. He served \nhonorably, and I have given considerable weight to his military service. However, \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nApplicant has failed to act responsibly for years regarding his finances. He has not met \nhis burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. He mitigated the security concerns under Guideline E, personal \nconduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n13 \n",

He served on active \nduty in the U.S. military from 2008 until he was medically retired with an honorable \ndischarge in October 2017. He served two combat deployments to Afghanistan.

He has worked for \nhis current employer or a predecessor contractor on the same contract since shortly \nafter his discharge from the military. He seeks to retain a security clearance, which he \nhas held since his military service. He attended college for a period without earning a \ndegree. He married in 2009 and divorced in 2018. He has two children from the \nmarriage who live with him. He married his current wife in 2018. (Transcript (Tr.) at 16-\n17, 20, 29-38, 60, 66-67; GE 1-3) \nApplicant did not file his federal income tax return for tax year 2017 when it was \ndue (SOR \u00b6 1.a). He explained that his tax returns were simple while he was in the \nmilitary. There were more forms and other documents required for his 2017 return, he \nwas pending a divorce, and he missed the filing deadline. In his January 2019 \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), he reported that he failed to file in \n2018. (Tr. at 23-26; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3) His 2018 tax return was not \nyet due when he submitted the SF 86. His 2017 tax return should have been filed in \n2018. I am satisfied that he meant his tax-year 2017 returns, which should have been \nfiled in 2018. \nApplicant was interviewed for his background investigation on March 19, 2019. \nHe admitted that he had not filed his 2017 federal income tax return. He stated that he \nplanned to file the return by the end of March 2019. Applicant was interviewed again in \nOctober 2019. He stated that he had not filed his 2017 return as he was still attempting \nto obtain the necessary documents. He stated that he filed his 2018 federal return and \nrecently went through an audit in which the IRS determined that he owed a 10% penalty \nfor a withdrawal from his Thrift Savings Plan. (GE 2, 3) \nThe IRS tax account transcript for 2018 shows Applicant\u2019s federal income tax \nreturn was filed in March 2019; an amended return was filed in September 2019; there \nwas an examination of the return; and additional tax was assessed in December 2019. \nHis 2018 IRS wage and income transcript reports that he had taxable income of $8,177 \nand $8,836 due to distributions from retirement accounts, with $1,635 withheld for \ntaxes.

(Applicant\u2019s response to SOR) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.

The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.

He presented his 2018 \ntranscripts at his hearing. He was told they were the wrong year, but a 2017 tax account \ntranscript would clarify everything. In his post-hearing submission, he stated that he was \nunable to obtain a 2017 tax account transcript, and he submitted a wage and income \ntranscript, which does not show when or if a return had been filed. \nThe Appeal Board has held that \u201cit is reasonable for a Judge to expect applicants \nto present documentation about the satisfaction of specific debts.\u201d See ISCR Case No. \n09-07091 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 11, 2010) (quoting ISCR Case No. 04-10671 at 3 (App. \nBd. May 1, 2006)). It is Applicant\u2019s burden to mitigate established facts. He has not \nestablished that his 2017 federal income tax return has been filed. AG \u00b6 20(f) is not \napplicable. \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). \nApplicant denied owing the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.h, 1.j, and 1.k, which \ntotal about $923. None of the debts are listed on the July 2022 credit report. Those \ndebts are mitigated. \nI am giving Applicant the benefit of the doubt on the $11,057 debt for an \napartment (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Applicant stated that the monthly rent was about $700 to $800, \nso it is unclear how the landlord arrived at the $11,057 figure. It appears the landlord \nmay not have factored in the obligation to mitigate damages. The debt is not listed on \nthe most recent credit report. It is mitigated. \nThe two military exchange credit card accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d) were paid \nthrough a combination of attaching Applicant\u2019s income tax refunds and payments from \nhis paycheck, either through garnishment, voluntary payments, or a combination of the \ntwo. Those debts are mitigated. However, court-ordered or otherwise involuntary means \nof debt resolution, such as garnishment and attachment of income tax refunds, are \nentitled to less weight than means initiated and carried through by the debtor himself. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). \nI \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFor the remaining debts, there is no evidence of any voluntary payments. The \ncreditor for the $579 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.f) issued an IRS Form 1099-C, cancelling the debt. \nWhile that mitigates the specific debt, it does little to mitigate Applicant\u2019s overall history \nof financial problems. Applicant\u2019s case was disjointed and often inconsistent. He \nadmitted that he was at times confused, possibly related to his PTSD. For whatever \nreason, he did not provide proof that his 2017 tax return had been filed. I am satisfied \nthat he owes the $1,896 and $986 debts alleged SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.i, and that those \ndebts have not been paid. \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his \ndebts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that financial \nconsiderations security concerns remain despite the presence of some mitigation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s honorable military service and particularly his combat \ndeployments. He appears to be on the right track financially, but for whatever reason, \nhe did not provide documents that might have been able to mitigate the security \nconcerns. The absence of documents highlighted his inconsistent statements. The \nprotection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires \nthat \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility \nwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Without more documentation, I must \nfollow that mandate. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.h: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j-1.k: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

She denies the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.i, and 1.n \u2013 1.v with some \nexplanations. \nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a DOD contractor who seeks a security \nclearance.

The cited sources contain more specific information.) \nFinancial Considerations \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant has a history of financial irresponsibility. The \nSOR alleged 22 delinquent accounts, with an approximate total balance of $50,950. The \nSOR also alleged Appellant filed for bankruptcy on two occasions. The first was a \nChapter 7 bankruptcy filed in January 2002. The debts were discharged in April 2002. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.w: Gov 3) The second bankruptcy was a Chapter 13 bankruptcy which was \nfiled in May 2010. The Chapter 13 bankruptcy was dismissed in January 2012 for failure \nto make payments. (SOR \u00b6 1.x: Gov 4) \nApplicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2002 when she was on active duty. \nShe purchased a car for her mother. Applicant purchased the car in her name, but her \nmother agreed to make the payments. Her mother did not make the car payments and \nthe car was repossessed. Applicant\u2019s wages were ultimately garnished. The \ngarnishment took most of her paycheck. She was only 19 at the time. Her Sergeant \nMajor suggested that she file for bankruptcy. (SOR \u00b6 1.w: Tr. 20-22; Gov 3) \nIn May 2010, Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy.

A misunderstanding caused her \nto be let go from her employment, but she was able to find another job. Applicant \ncontinued to care for her mother and her younger nephew. Her mother passed away \nunexpectedly in 2017, which caused additional expenses. Applicant testified she had a \nchoice to pay the rent or the credit card bills. She chose to pay the rent.

Applicant\u2019s debt resolution company successfully \ndisputed this account with the credit reporting agencies. It was removed from her credit \nreport. (Tr. 63; Gov 8 at 5; AE H at 2) \nDuring the hearing, Applicant indicated that she owes state income taxes for tax \nyears 2012 and 2017. She is in process of resolving her delinquent state income tax \ndebts. She claims both state income tax debts are almost paid off. (Tr. 30-31; Gov 5) \nShe has not filed her federal income tax returns for tax year 2021. She hired a person \nshe knows to prepare and file her federal income taxes for 2020 and 2021. She never \nheard from her friend about the status of the tax filings. She had to track her down to \nretrieve her federal income tax documents. She filed her federal income tax returns for \n2020, but not 2021. She intends to file her 2021 federal income tax returns with her \n2022 federal income tax returns. She believes she might owe the Internal Revenue \nService (IRS) money, but she is unsure of the amount. (Tr. 30-35) Applicant\u2019s state and \nfederal income tax issues are not alleged in the SOR.

Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board \nlisted five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered \nstating: \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines \nis applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.  \nId.

She is focused on her current bills so she can support herself and her \nnephew. (Tr. 62) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).   \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns. \nThe disqualifying conditions that are relevant to Applicant\u2019s case include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a long history of financial problems starting with a Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy which was discharged in April 2002, and a Chapter 13 bankruptcy which \nwas filed in May 2010 and dismissed in January 2012 for failure to make payments. The \nSOR alleges 22 delinquent debts with an approximate total balance of over $50,000. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. \nAn individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or careless in his obligations to protect classified information. Behaving \nirresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in \nother aspects of life. A person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until \nevidence is uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to pay debts under \nagreed terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations. \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \n\u00b6E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nAG \u00b6 20 includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and   \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies because Applicant\u2019s financial situation was impacted \nby her decision to care for her mother and nephews. Applicant was also adversely \naffected by a divorce and several health issues. These circumstances were beyond \nApplicant\u2019s control and adversely affected her ability to pay her bills. However, this \nmitigating condition is given less weight because Applicant has not demonstrated she \nacted responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant has not attempted to resolve any \nof the debts alleged in the SOR. She is waiting for the statute of limitations to expire so \nthey will be uncollectible. For this reason, AG \u00b6 20(b) is given less weight. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) partially applies. Applicant initially entered into an agreement with a \ndebt company who failed to make progress resolving the debts to Applicant\u2019s \nsatisfaction. However, it is unclear whether the debt company provided financial \ncounseling to Applicant which would help with establishing a budget. It appears the debt \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ncompany was more focused on disputing debts rather than helping Applicant establish a \nplan to repay her delinquent debts.  \nAG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply because Applicant has not demonstrated that she is \nmaking a good-faith effort to resolve her delinquent debts. Passively waiting for the \nstatute of limitations to pass is not considered a good-faith effort to resolve one\u2019s \ndelinquent debts. Credit is given to Applicant\u2019s attempts to resolve her state tax debts \nwhich were not alleged in the SOR. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies to the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.k and 1.v. \nApplicant provided proof these debts were successfully disputed and removed from her \ncredit report. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s active and reserve service in the United States Army. I \nconsidered her honorable discharge. I considered her many years of employment as a \nDepartment of Defense contractor. I considered Applicant\u2019s support and care of her \nmother and her nephews. I considered that she is raising one of her nephews who lives \nwith her. \nHowever, I also considered Applicant\u2019s long history of financial problems. She \ncontinues to have financial issues to include delinquent state income taxes and unfiled \nfederal income tax returns for tax year 2021. While she has taken steps towards \nresolving her financial issues, they have not been sufficient to stabilize Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial situation. She has not developed a meaningful track record of debt \nmanagement. This raises issues about her trustworthiness and reliability. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions as well as the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all the allegations in SOR. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 39 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2009. He served in the military from 2015 to 2018 and received an honorable discharge due to medical conditions in the paygrade of E-4. He has a 90% disability rating from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and receives about $2,500 a month in disability payments. He married in 2006 and divorced in 2017. He has two children from the marriage, ages 16 and 13. He pays about $700 a month for child support. He stated he had a short period of unemployment after he was discharged from the military but otherwise, he has had no other recent periods of unemployment. He earns an hourly wage and estimates his annual income to be approximately $75,000.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 27, 2022, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued to Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nIn Applicant\u2019s undated answer to the SOR, he requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge.

DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on September 12, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all the allegations in SOR. His admissions are incorporated into \nthe findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and \nexhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 39 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2009. He served in the \nmilitary from 2015 to 2018 and received an honorable discharge due to medical conditions \nin the paygrade of E-4. He has a 90% disability rating from the Department of Veterans \nAffairs (VA) and receives about $2,500 a month in disability payments. He married in \n2006 and divorced in 2017. He has two children from the marriage, ages 16 and 13. He \npays about $700 a month for child support. He stated he had a short period of \nunemployment after he was discharged from the military but otherwise, he has had no \nother recent periods of unemployment. He earns an hourly wage and estimates his annual \nincome to be approximately $75,000. (Tr. 19-24) \nThe SOR alleges Applicant failed to timely file his 2018 and 2019 federal and state \nincome tax returns (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b). His returns were filed late. Tax transcripts were \nincluded in his response to government interrogatories and reflect his 2018 federal \nincome tax return was filed in November 2020 and his 2019 federal income tax return \nwas filed in October 2020. The transcripts do not reflect an extension was filed. He \ntestified that his delinquent income tax returns are all filed. He did not provide proof that \nhis state income tax returns for these years were filed, but I believe he resolved them at \nthe same time he did his federal tax returns. He testified he has no outstanding tax \nbalance. No explanation was provided for why he filed his income tax returns late. (Tr. \n34-36; GE 2) \nThe SOR alleges Applicant has 14 delinquent student loans that are in collection \nor charged off and total approximately $92,044 (\u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.f - 1.k, 1.n, 1.o, 1.r, 1.u, 1.z, \nand 1.aa). He has ten delinquent consumer debts that are charged off or in collection \ntotaling approximately $30,845 (\u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.l, 1.m, 1.p, 1.q, 1.s, 1.t, 1.v, 1.y, 1.bb). These \ndebts include a credit card that he used to fund a vacation in 2016 for his family that cost \nabout $10,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.e balance - $15,232). He testified he was trying to save his \nmarriage and was hoping a family vacation would help. Another delinquent debt is for a \ndog he purchased for a significant other who had medical issues. The balance owed is \n$1,179 (SOR \u00b6 1.t) Another delinquent account is owed to a jewelry store for items he \npurchased for family members (\u00b6 1.p - $1,480) He also has two medical debts that are in \ncollection totaling $302 (\u00b6\u00b6 1.w and 1.x). Applicant has made no effort to contact the \ncreditors or attempt to resolve the debts. All of the debts are corroborated by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions in the SOR, statements made to the government investigator that Applicant \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nauthenticated, testimony during his hearing, and credit reports from June 2020, February \n2021, and August 2023.

He \ntestified it was an oversight and was a mistake. Applicant\u2019s testimony was not credible, \nevasive, and lacked candor. (Tr. 40-43) \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in August 2020. He was \nconfronted with all of his unpaid student loans and other delinquent debts. He told the \ninvestigator he has never been financially stable and since getting a steady job in \nSeptember 2018 he thought about repairing his credit but had not taken action until June \n2020 when he began to research the best way to get out of debt. He told the investigator \nthat it was time to do the right thing, stand up, and take care of his debts now that he was \nfinancially stable. He was unaware at the time of the total amount of his delinquent debts \nbut was aware they needed to be addressed. He was not stressed about the debts. He \nsaid he started to do online research about debt consolidation and was weighing the \noptions of working with a debt consolidator or handling the debts on his own. He told the \ninvestigator he was gathering information and that once he had a handle on it, he could \nmake a better, more informed decision. He said that in the next year he would gain more \nknowledge to make that decision. He said that he had the ability to pay and intended to \npay his delinquent debts. (GE 2) \nApplicant testified that after he completed college in 2009, his parents made \npayments on his student loans for a period, and he also made payments for a period. He \nsaid he was underemployed and not earning sufficient income to pay the student loans. \nIn 2017, he was going through a divorce, and he was in the military not earning enough \nincome to repay his student loans. He also stated there were periods of time when \nthe loans were in forbearance or deferred.1 He believes he stopped making \npayments sometime in 2012 or 2013. He testified he does not have sufficient money \nto repay his student loans at this time. When he last contacted the creditor, he was \noffered a payment plan but could not afford it. He could not recall when he made this \ncontact. He planned on paying the smaller debts first and contacting creditors to \ndispute some debts. He planned to pay all of his debts. (Tr. 24-32, 36-47) \nAt Applicant\u2019s hearing, he testified he does not have any extra money to pay his \ndelinquent debts. He is working to gain experience and knowledge so he can get a better \njob with an increased salary. He has no savings or pension plan. He has minimal \nexpendable income at the end of the month after paying bills. He has made no payments \non any of the debts alleged in the SOR. He testified he is researching how best to address \nthe debts. He continues to study his options. Since his August 2020 interview with the \n1 US Dept of Education placed student loans in forbearance from March 2020 to October 2023 due to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic under repeated Presidential Executive Orders. Applicant\u2019s student loans were \ncharged-off or in collection status in 2018.

He testified he has not spoken \nto them in the past three years. (Tr. 24-32, 36-47, 55-58) \nApplicant testified that he has randomly searched different websites on the Internet \nfor options of how to resolve his delinquent debts but has not spoken to anyone personally \nor taken any specific action or contracted with any financial agency for assistance. He \nhas not had formal financial counseling. Applicant stated that his plan is to research and \nstudy his options for resolving his debts (Tr. 44-47, 55-58) \nAny derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered \nfor disqualifying purposes but may be considered in the application of the mitigating \nconditions, in making a credibility determination, and in a whole-person analysis. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income taxes as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely file his 2018 and 2019 federal and state income tax \nreturns. He has 14 delinquent student loans totaling more than $92,000 and more than \n$30,000 of consumer and medical debts. He has been aware for years that they are a \nsecurity concern. During his background interview, he told the investigator he was going \nto pay these debts and was researching the best option. During his hearing three years \nlater, he admitted taking no action on any of the debts and was still researching the best \noption. The evidence supports the application of all of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant filed his delinquent tax returns and does not owe any delinquent taxes. I \ngave him the benefit of the doubt regarding the filing of his state income tax returns when \nhe completed his federal tax returns.

He told the government \ninvestigator three years ago he was researching his options on how to resolve the debts \nand intended to pay them. Since then, he has not taken any action and continues to \nresearch with no real plan. Applicant stated that he does not have the resources to pay \nhis debts. He attributed some of his financial problems to being underpaid before he went \ninto the service, then being underpaid while in the service, and going through a divorce. \nHis divorce was in 2017. These were conditions beyond his control. For the full application \nof AG \u00b6 20(b) Applicant must have acted responsibly. Other than researching his options, \nhe has not taken any action to address his delinquent debts and continues to \nprocrastinate in addressing any of his legal obligations. AG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal \napplication. His debts are numerous and ongoing. I cannot find that future financial issues \nare unlikely to recur due to his inaction to address any of his debts. His conduct casts \ndoubt on current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not \napply. He has not received financial counseling from a legitimate and credible source, \nand there are not clear indications that his problems are under control or being resolved. \nHe has not made a good-faith effort to pay any of the creditors. He did not provide a \nreasonable basis to dispute any of the debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nThe record evidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

He \nrequested a hearing, whereupon the case was assigned to me on September 1, 2022. On \nSeptember 27, 2022, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of video \nteleconference hearing, scheduling Applicant\u2019s case for October 19, 2022. The hearing \nwas held as scheduled. I received four Government exhibits (GE 1 \u2013 GE 4), seventeen \nApplicant exhibits (AE A \u2013 AE R), and considered Applicant\u2019s testimony. The transcript (Tr.) \nwas received on October 19, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 57-year-old married man with two adult children from a previous \nmarriage. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2008, and in 2010, he earned a master\u2019s \ndegree in the field of conflict management. (Tr. 15) Applicant is a veteran of the U.S. Army. \nHe served on active duty from 1984 to 1989. After leaving activity duty, he affiliated with \nthe Army Reserve where he served from 1989 to 2019. He retired honorably. (GE 1 at 20) \nApplicant is a logistics management specialist. He has been working for his current \nemployer since January 2020. (GE 1 at 13) He worked with his previous employer, a \nmilitary command, performing similar work from 2015 to 2019. (GE 3) \nIn January 2016, Applicant went on temporary travel duty (TDY) with a female\nmilitary officer who was superior to him on the unit\u2019s organization chart. (GE 3 at 3) It was \nnot uncommon for coworkers to eat dinner together while on TDY. One night, while at \ndinner with the officer, Applicant told her that if she was not married, \u201c[he] would be all over \n[her],\u201d and that \u201cwhat happens [on TDY], stays [on TDY].\u201d (GE 3 at 3) She rebuffed his \nadvances and did not immediately report it until some time later, when her supervisor \nasked her to accompany Applicant to another TDY assignment.  (GE 4 at 3) The \ncoworker\u2019s supervisor then reported the allegation to the unit commander that same day. \n(GE 4 at 3) Subsequently, the unit commander appointed an investigator to conduct a \npreliminary inquiry into the allegations. During the investigation, two additional female \ncoworkers alleged that Applicant had made unwelcome sexual advances toward them. (GE \n4 at 4) One of the sexual advances occurred between 2016 and 2017 via the following e-\nmail exchange:\n \n \nApplicant: So how many do you have in your stables? LOL Very curious \nabout you. \nCoworker: NUNYA [None of your business] \nApplicant: So no room for anyone? Let me know when you have some free \nspace. (GE 3 at 4; GE 4 at 9)) \nTwo of the women noted that Applicant\u2019s relationship with them became tense, \nconfrontational, and intimidating after they rejected his advances. For example, one of the \nwomen stated that on one occasion, he intentionally bumped into her while walking by her \nin the hallway.

Moreover, he recommended that Applicant attend \ntrainings on sexual harassment, conflict and anger management skills, and professionalism \nin the workplace and on travel. (GE 4 at 5) \nThe woman that Applicant propositioned while on TDY stated that her relationship \nwith him continued to deteriorate after the investigator released his report. (GE 4 at 5) Her \ncontinued complaints prompted their supervisor, in July 2018, to initiate a hostile work \nenvironment inquiry into Applicant\u2019s behavior. (GE 4 at 5) The investigator took sworn \nstatements from Applicant, the coworker that Applicant propositioned on TDY, three other \nemployees, and a contractor. All of the people interviewed stated that Applicant\u2019s behavior \ncreated a tense work environment. In addition, the contractor accused Applicant of flirting \nwith her and rubbing himself against the back of her chair while she was seated in it. As \nwith the other woman who had reported such behavior earlier, he became hostile when she \nrebuffed his advances, at one point yelling at her to \u201cget her ass\u201d up from her chair to \nperform a task for him. (GE 4 at 6) \nWhile the investigation was ongoing, a coworker, who was not involved in the \nongoing in-house harassment investigation, filed a complaint with the Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission (EEO) against Applicant, alleging sexual harassment. (GE 4 at 8) \nIn the complaint, the employee stated that Applicant remarked on her looks, rubbed her \nshoulders on one occasion, and frequently asked her out. (GE 4 at 9) \nThe EEO complaint prompted the unit commander, in November 2018, to expand \nthe investigation. (GE 4 at 8) Per the expanded investigation, the investigator asked all of \nthe command\u2019s employees and contractors if they had seen or experienced workplace \nsexual harassment from Applicant. (GE 4 at 9) In response, several more women came \nforward to complain of sexual advances or inappropriate comments, including a woman \nwho was the command\u2019s special victim counsel on sexual harassment, and several women \nin subordinate positions (GE 3 at 8; GE 4 at 10) All of them prepared sworn statements. In \naddition to the women who alleged sexual harassment, a coworker who witnessed an \nepisode of inappropriate conduct provided a statement. (GE 4 at 11) \nOn November 14, 2018, Applicant issued a sworn statement, as part of the \nexpanded investigation. (GE at 11) During the ISCR hearing, he testified that he was \nunaware that he had been under investigation for sexual harassment until he received a \nnotice of termination in June 2019. (Tr. 19) \nDuring the November 2018 investigation, Applicant denied all of the allegations \nexcept the allegation based on the email exchange, as set forth above. He characterized \nthe email conversation as a continuation of harmless \u201cbanter\u201d that the coworker initiated. \n(Tr. 53) He stated that his superiors never wanted him in his position from the day he \nstarted because he \u201cwouldn\u2019t conform to what they wanted [him] to do,\u201d and that their \nallegations against him were part of a conspiracy to replace him with someone whom they \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \ndesired. (GE 2 at 7; Tr. 41) As for the women in subordinate grade levels, he contended \nthat they resented him because he was a stern, sometimes abrasive taskmaster who was \nholding them accountable. (GE 3 at 11, 17) \nIn December 2018, the investigator issued a memorandum entitled \u201cSupplemental \nFindings and Recommendations.\u201d (GE 4 at 11) He found that Applicant\u2019s denial of the \nallegations was \u201cdramatically\u201d outweighed by the cumulative, contrary testimony, and \n\u201centirely unconvincing.\u201d (GE 4 at 11) The investigator concluded that Applicant\u2019s conduct \ncreated a hostile work environment, and recommended that he be suspended for seven \ndays. (GE 4 at 11) \nIn January 2019, the unit commander issued a memorandum regarding the \ninvestigator\u2019s conclusion. (GE 4 at 11) He approved the findings, but concluded that they \nmerited termination, rather than suspension. (GE 4 at 12) In reaching this conclusion, he \nnoted that Applicant\u2019s \u201cfailure to accept even the smallest responsibility for [his] actions \nwas troubling,\u201d that rehabilitation \u201cdoes not appear viable,\u201d and that Applicant \u201c[could] not \nbe trusted to be alone with subordinate personnel.\u201d (GE 3 at 11) Consequently, the \ncommander issued a notice of decision of proposed removal. (GE 4 at 15) Applicant \npresented an oral reply to the proposal, together with several character reference letters. \n(GE 4 at 16) In October 2019, the command executive officer sustained the proposed \nremoval. In doing so, he found that Applicant\u2019s \u201cmisconduct eroded the chain of \ncommand\u2019s trust and confidence,\u201d and that his \u201clack of ownership over his actions . . . \ncombined with the pervasiveness of the misbehavior are clear indicators of a lack of \nrehabilitation potential.\u201d (GE 3 at 10) Moreover, he concluded that Applicant\u2019s credibility \nwas degraded by numerous inconsistencies in his reply. (GE 3 at 11) In October 2019, the \ncommander issued a decision letter officially removing Applicant from the job. \nApplicant appealed the decision to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) \nAfter considering Applicant\u2019s testimony and the sworn statements of his accusers, the \nMSPB, in July 2020, affirmed the decision. In doing so, the judge noted four times in the \ndecision that Applicant was not credible. (GE 4 at 18-20, 37) \nAt the MSPB hearing, Applicant testified that his conduct, at worst, was merely \nflirtatious, and that flirting was human nature. (GE 4 at 26) Between 2016 and 2019, \nApplicant completed multiple trainings on sexual harassment in the workplace. (GE 4 at 10) \nAt the ISCR hearing, Applicant reiterated the positions he took during the work \ninvestigation and the MSPB hearing. Also, he testified that he was a good, well-respected \nemployee at the job from which he was terminated in 2019, and provided records, including \nmultiple character references and good annual evaluations.

Egan, 484\nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and\ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive \nOrder 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).1 \n1 The factors under AG \u00b6 2(a) are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the onduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                             \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \nThe security concerns about sexual behavior are set forth in AG \u00b6 18: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion, or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress . . . may raise questions about an individual\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. \nBetween 2016 and 2019, Applicant either sexually harassed or made inappropriate \ncomments of a sexual nature to multiple colleagues and created a hostile working \nenvironment. AG \u00b6 13(c), \u201csexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress;\u201d and AG \u00b6 13(d), \u201csexual behavior . . . that reflects a lack \nof discretion or judgment,\u201d apply. \nApplicant denied the allegations throughout the investigative process leading to his \ntermination. All of the fact finders who either investigated or adjudicated his case \nconcluded, in sustaining the allegations, that he was not a credible witness. Having \nreviewed the record evidence of these earlier inquiries, and listened to Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony, I agree with the conclusions of the earlier fact finders regarding his lack of \ncredibility. Specifically, Applicant\u2019s testimony that he was unaware that his employer was \ninvestigating him for sexual harassment until June 2019 directly contradicted a sworn \nstatement he executed as part of the expanded investigation of November 2018. Given \nApplicant\u2019s lack of credibility and lack of contrition, exemplified by his outlandish belief that \nflirting with coworkers on the job is acceptable, I conclude that none of the mitigating \nconditions applies. Applicant has failed to mitigate the sexual behavior security concerns. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d(AG \u00b6 15) Applicant\u2019s sexual harassment of multiple coworkers, including \nsubordinates between 2016 and 2019, together with his hostile behavior towards his \naccusers after he learned of the allegations, led to his termination. AG \u00b6 16(d)(2), \u201cany \ndisruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior,\u201d applies. \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nIf Applicant cannot be trusted to be alone with subordinate personnel without \nengaging in misconduct, as his employer concluded in his termination decision, he certainly \ncannot be trusted with access to classified information. I conclude that none of the \nmitigating conditions applies, and that Applicant has failed to mitigate the personal conduct \nsecurity concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the whole-person factors in my analysis of the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions of the pertinent guidelines, as set forth and discussed above, and \nthey do not warrant a favorable conclusion. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nMarc E. Curry \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 52 years old and married to his third wife. Their marriage occurred in January 2015. She is Korean and Applicant moved with his wife to Korea in early 2015. He has six children, ranging in age from 34 to 6. The two youngest children live with him, along with his wife\u2019s two children. He is an honorably retired technical sergeant (E-6) from the United States Air Force (USAF). Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor since September 2019 and seeks to retain national security eligibility and a security clearance in connection with his employment. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 13A, 15, and 17; Applicant Exhibit K; Tr. 26-27, 74.) Applicant was on active duty with the USAF from December 1991 to September 2013, when he retired. After retirement, he worked in the oil industry until March 2015, when he was laid off. He was unemployed from that time until he began work with his current employer. Applicant stated that his employment situation from 2015 to 2019 is what caused his delinquent debt issues. Since becoming employed Applicant has worked to resolve his past-due indebtedness. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 13A and 15; Tr. 22-24, 26-27.) Applicant was divorced from his second wife in November 2014.

Department Counsel was prepared \nto proceed on December 30, 2021. The case was assigned to me on May 18, 2022. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on May 24, \n2022. The case was heard on June 30, 2022. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the \nhearing on July 11, 2022. \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 5, which were admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant Exhibits \nA through O, which were also admitted without objection. He asked that the record remain \nopen for the receipt of additional documentation. Applicant timely submitted Applicant \nExhibits P through X, which were also admitted without objection, and the record closed \non July 14, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 52 years old and married to his third wife. Their marriage occurred in \nJanuary 2015. She is Korean and Applicant moved with his wife to Korea in early 2015. \nHe has six children, ranging in age from 34 to 6. The two youngest children live with him, \nalong with his wife\u2019s two children. He is an honorably retired technical sergeant (E-6) from \nthe United States Air Force (USAF). Applicant has been employed by a defense \ncontractor since September 2019 and seeks to retain national security eligibility and a \nsecurity clearance in connection with his employment. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections \n13A, 15, and 17; Applicant Exhibit K; Tr. 26-27, 74.) \nApplicant was on active duty with the USAF from December 1991 to September \n2013, when he retired. After retirement, he worked in the oil industry until March 2015, \nwhen he was laid off. He was unemployed from that time until he began work with his \ncurrent employer.

(Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 13A and 15; Tr. \n22-24, 26-27.) \nApplicant was divorced from his second wife in November 2014. The requirement \nto pay child support after his lay off from the oil industry also affected his ability to repay \nhis other debts, as further described under 1.i, below. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section \n17; Tr. 24.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, \nuntrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.

He denied \nthe remaining allegations. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had seven charged-off or past-due consumer \ndebts in the total amount of approximately $34,649. The existence and amount of several \nof the debts is supported by credit reports dated October 9, 2019; and February 19, 2021. \nThey are also supported by Applicant\u2019s answers on his e-QIP, and his statements to an \ninvestigator from the Office of Personnel Management on July 1, 2020. Applicant is also \nalleged to have not filed his Federal tax returns for tax years 2015 through 2019, and to \nowe back child support of approximately $27,918. (Government Exhibits 1, 2, 3, 4, and \n5.) \nThe current status of the debts is as follows: \n1.a. Applicant denied that he owed $19,477 for an automobile loan that has been \ncharged off. This automobile was repossessed in February 2015 because Applicant lost \nhis job and could no longer afford to make payments. Applicant testified that he spoke \nwith the creditor several times over the telephone in 2020 in an attempt to resolve this \ndebt without success. There were also communication difficulties with the creditor due to \nthe Corona Virus pandemic and the fact that Applicant lives in South Korea. He provided \ncontemporaneous notes reflecting his contacts with the creditor. (Applicant Exhibit T; Tr. \n21-23, 27-29, 66-68.) This debt is not resolved, but Applicant has been actively working \nto resolve it. \n1.b. Applicant has consistently denied that he owed a past-due debt to a telephone \ncompany in the amount of $2,062. He stated that he did not know of this debt until \nrecently. Applicant explained that he had a prepaid phone with this company and the \namount of $45 a month was automatically withdrawn from his account. The 2021 credit \nreport submitted by the Government shows this debt. The Government\u2019s 2019 credit \nreport, and Applicant\u2019s credit report from the same year, do not show any debt to this \ncreditor. Applicant has recently attempted several times to contact this creditor without \nsuccess. (Government Exhibits 2 and 3; Applicant Exhibit T; Tr. 29-31, 63.) Based on the \nstate of the record I find there is insufficient evidence to support the allegation that \nApplicant owes this debt. \n1.c. Applicant admitted that he owed a collection account to a county government \nin the amount of $341. Applicant stated in his Answer, during his July 2020 interview, and \nin his testimony that he paid $70 a month on this debt until it was resolved. With regard \nto this allegation the Government\u2019s 2019 credit report stated, \u201cConsumer disputes after \nresolution.\u201d This debt does not appear in the Government\u2019s 2021 credit report. It also does \nnot appear in Applicant\u2019s 2019 credit report. (Government Exhibits 2, 3, and 4; Applicant \nExhibit T; Tr. 31-33.) Based on the state of the record I find there is sufficient evidence to \nsupport Applicant\u2019s statements that he has resolved this debt. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1.d. Applicant admitted that he owed a charged-off debt to a finance company in \nthe amount of $1,855. While admitting the existence of the debt he also stated that he did \nnot open it. Rather, Applicant has repeatedly stated his second ex-wife, without his \npermission, took out this loan. This debt does not appear in the Government\u2019s 2021 credit \nreport. Applicant provided documentation supporting his statement that he has attempted \nto resolve this debt. (Government Exhibits 2, 3, and 4; Applicant Exhibit T; Tr. 33-34, 62.) \nThis debt is not resolved, but Applicant has been actively working to resolve it. \n1.e. Applicant has consistently denied that he owed a collection agency for a \ncharged-off debt for a bank credit card in the amount of $580. He stated that he has never \nhad a credit card with this bank. With regard to this allegation the Government\u2019s 2019 \ncredit report stated, \u201cAccount information disputed by consumer.\u201d The Report of \nInvestigation (ROI) from his interview with a Government investigator contains a read out \nof telephone calls Applicant made to the alleged originating bank regarding this credit \ncard. The bank\u2019s representatives and Applicant were unable to confirm this particular \ndebt. (Governments Exhibit 2 and 4; Applicant Exhibit T; Tr. 35-37.) This debt is in dispute. \n1.f. Applicant has consistently denied that he owed a finance company for a \ncharged-off debt in the amount of $9,819. He stated that he has never had an account \nwith this particular creditor. Applicant stated he contacted the creditor but they were \nunable to find any information on him. This debt is found in the Government\u2019s 2019 credit \nreport but is not found in the 2021 credit report. (Government Exhibits 2 and 3; Tr. 37-38, \n63.) Based on the state of the record I find there is insufficient evidence to support the \nallegation that Applicant owes this debt. \n1.g. Applicant has consistently denied that he owed a finance company for a \ncharged-off debt in the amount of $515. He stated that he has never had an account with \nthis particular creditor and believes this account was opened fraudulently by his ex-wife. \nHe reported this to the creditor\u2019s fraud department in 2020. The creditor investigated the \nclaim and came to the conclusion, \u201cwe were unable to find evidence of unauthorized \nactivity.\u201d Applicant stated that he has a second dispute filed with this creditor since he \nbelieves they made a mistake with the original one. (Government Exhibit 4; Applicant \nExhibit U; Tr. 34-35.) This debt is not resolved, but Applicant has been actively working \nto resolve it. \n1.h. Applicant admitted that he had not filed his tax returns in a timely manner for \ntax years 2015 through 2019. As stated earlier, Applicant was unemployed the majority \nof those years, living in Korea, and only receiving his military retirement pay. He has \nconsistently stated that a financial adviser attached to the Air Force told Applicant in 2015 \nthat he did not have to file tax returns if his only income was his retirement pay. After \nissuance of the SOR Applicant worked with a tax preparer to file all of his past-due returns. \nThe tax preparer confirmed this fact in writing. In addition, it appears that Applicant\u2019s \nincome would have fallen under the statutory minimum required for filing a tax return. For \nexample, Applicant provided documentation showing he made approximately $15,000 in \nretirement pay in 2015. The statutory minimum for that year, as described by the IRS, for \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \na married taxpayer filing jointly was $20,600. (Department of the Treasury, Internal \nRevenue Service, Publication 501, Exemptions, Standard Deduction, and Filing \nInformation, Page 2, Table 1: 2015 Filing Requirements Chart for Most Taxpayers, \nhttps://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/p501--2015.pdf.) (Applicant Exhibits E, G, H, I, and P; Tr. \n38-45, 56-62.) \n1.i. Applicant admitted owing a state child support arrears. The arrearage occurred \nafter Applicant lost his job in 2015. However, he has provided documentation from the \nstate attorney general\u2019s office showing that the amount has been reduced from $27,918 \nwhen the SOR was issued to $17,208 at the time of the hearing. The documentation \nfurther shows that Applicant has been making consistent payments of $1,700 monthly to \ncover current child support and reduce his arrears. (Government Exhibits 4 and 5; \nApplicant Exhibits C, D, E, and Q; Tr. 46, 64-66, 69-70.) This debt is being resolved. \nApplicant\u2019s current financial status is stable. Other than the accounts described \nabove he has no other delinquent debt. He is able to pay his current debts without \ndifficulty. The primary debt he is resolving is his child support arrearage, which is being \npaid every month as described above. (Tr. 46, 49-50, 71.) \nApplicant submitted evidence that he has been unable to access his credit report \nonline, due to the fact he lives overseas. He stated that this has impacted his ability to \nresolve the alleged past-due indebtedness. (Applicant Exhibit F; Tr. 71-73.) \nMitigation \nApplicant submitted documentation showing that he is knowledgeable about his \nsecurity responsibilities. (Applicant Exhibits L and M; Tr. 51-54.) \nApplicant had a successful military career, as shown in his DD-214. He has also \nreceived laudatory reviews in his current job, including a recent pay increase. (Applicant \nExhibits K, W, and X; Tr. 54-55.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process.

The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant had seven past-due or charged-off debts, past-due child support, and \nhad not filed several years of taxes at the time the SOR was issued. These facts establish \nprima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to \nApplicant to mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes five conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s financial situation occurred because he had several life-changing \nevents in the 2015 time frame that affected his financial well-being. He got divorced, took \non child support of the children of that marriage, was laid off from his lucrative position, \nand moved to Korea with his new wife. His income was substantially reduced almost \novernight. Once in Korea it took Applicant several years to find employment that would \nallow him to begin to resolve his debts. He has been paying his regular child support and \narrears at a steady monthly rate of $1,700 a month for several years. The arrearage has \nbeen substantially reduced. \nBased on the available record, I found several debts to be unsupported by \nsubstantial evidence. Applicant has legitimate, documented, and ongoing disputes with \nseveral others. He has attempted to resolve without success the repossessed automobile \nloan for $19,477. As set forth in the record Applicant has consistently made good-faith \nefforts to resolve these debts. His lack of success does not indicate a lack of desire or \neffort on the part of the Applicant to resolve them. \nTurning to the tax returns. All of the subject returns have been filed, according to \nApplicant\u2019s tax preparer. In addition, there is evidence that Applicant was not statutorily \nrequired to file tax returns for those years. In either event, he has mitigated that SOR \nsubparagraph as well. \nIn reviewing the available evidence, I find that all of the mitigating conditions cited \nhere apply. Paragraph 1 is found for Applicant. \nIn support of these findings, I cite the Appeal Board\u2019s decision in ISCR Case No. \n07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) for the proposition that the adjudicative guidelines \ndo not require that an applicant be debt-free. The Board\u2019s guidance for adjudications in \ncases such as this is the following: \n. . . an applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that \nhe has paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is \nthat an applicant demonstrate that he has established a plan to resolve his \nfinancial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The \nJudge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s \nplan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and \nrealistic. There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all \noutstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and \nconcomitant conduct) may provide for the payments of such debts one at a \ntime. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal \ncitations and quotation marks omitted). \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s potential for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has mitigated the \nconcerns regarding his past-due indebtedness. He has also resolved the concerns over \nhis unfiled tax returns. Overall, the record evidence does not create substantial doubt as \nto Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.i: \nFor Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance.

In August 2019, his wages were garnished for a delinquent account in the \namount of $2,053.

In September \n2022, he hired a credit-repair company that also provides credit education to contact the \ncreditors of his delinquent accounts and establish settlement agreements or repayment \nplans. The credit-repair company will advise Applicant on how to resolve the debts. He \nalso has enlisted his sister to help him with his budget and debt resolution. He entered a \nrepayment plan for the credit-card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.g in April 2021 prior \nto receiving the SOR, and the account was paid in full in July 2022. The SOR debts \nalleged in \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.h, and 1.i were resolved with the short sale of the house prior to the \nissuance of the SOR. Applicant received an offer to settle the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a \non July 27, 2022, and paid the settlement offer on August 22, 2022. AX A; AX B; AX E; \nResponse.) \nApplicant\u2019s June 7, 2022, CBR shows that he had several accounts that became \ndelinquent in 2020 and 2021 that were not alleged in the SOR. He paid two of the \ncollection accounts for $2,867 and $4,139 in August 2022. The CBR shows that he had \ntotal delinquent revolving-account debt of $2,873.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG.

An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the\nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition,\nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe record evidence establishes two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues initially arose around 2006-2007 while he was on active \nduty. He and his wife incurred joint debt which, in part, remained unresolved at the time \nof their divorce in 2013, and for which Applicant remained responsible after their divorce. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhile separated, Applicant made monthly payments to his wife from his retirement \npayments. Beginning in 2012 during the separation, he made monthly child support \npayments of $2,000 until June 2020, when the payments were reduced to $1,500. He \ncontinues to make these child-support payments. Starting in July 2019, he was no longer \nable to make his monthly mortgage-loan payments. Beginning in August 2019 and again \nin January 2020, his wages were garnished to satisfy two delinquent accounts. \nApplicant has paid or settled six of the SOR accounts which total $16,086 and \nmake up 65% of the SOR debt. The three remaining accounts have been charged off. \nThe $6,013 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e is listed on the March 2023 CBR with a $0 balance \nand the other two debts are not listed. The credit-repair company will advise Applicant on \nwhat action, if any, to take regarding these accounts. Since June 2023, he has reduced \nhis total revolving-account debt by $1,056 and his total installment-account debt by \n$2,026. \nApplicant incurred five debts that became delinquent in 2020 and 2021. He paid \ntwo of the accounts in August 2022. He has contacted the creditors of each of the three \nremaining delinquent accounts and has entered repayment agreements with two of them. \nThe third account is for a charged-off vehicle loan. He has made payments on the account \nand is working with the credit-repair company as well as the with creditor to establish \neither a settlement agreement or a repayment plan. He is aware of each of his accounts \nand is systematically worked on reducing his existing debts. \nApplicant has acted in good faith in his efforts to resolve his financial \ndelinquencies. \u201cGood faith\u201d means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, \n1999). A security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. ISCR Case No. 09-\n02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010.) A person is not required to establish resolution of every \ndebt alleged in the SOR. He or she need only establish a plan to resolve financial \nproblems and take significant actions to implement the plan. The adjudicative guidelines \ndo not require that an individual make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, \nnor do they require that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. \n07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties were exacerbated by circumstances largely beyond \nhis control; however he acted responsibly under the circumstances. There is nothing in \nthe record that suggests Applicant\u2019s financial habits are reckless or irresponsible or that \nhe is likely to disregard his financial obligations in the future. He accepts responsibility for \nnot having been more diligent about handling his finances in the past and resolving his \ndelinquent accounts in a timelier manner. He has taken positive actions to better \nunderstand his finances and how to effectively manage them. He established a plan to \nresolve his debts and has implemented that plan. He lives within his means, maintains a \nbudget, and has not incurred any recent delinquent debt. He hired a credit-repair \ncompany and has enlisted the assistance of his sister to help him manage his finances. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s past financial issues do not cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but I \nhave also considered the following: \nApplicant served honorably in the Air Force for 24 years, including deploying to \nIraq. He has held a security clearance for over 20 years. He demonstrated his dedication \nto continuing to serve as a civilian through earning his bachelor\u2019s degree in 2017. He is \nfinancially stable and fiscally responsible. While those granted access to classified \ninformation are held to a high standard of conduct, they are not held to a standard of \nperfection. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the potential security concerns raised by his financial issues. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStephanie C. Hess \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

(Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guidelines I, G, and E.

(Tr1. 64-65, 103) He was diagnosed \nwith PTSD. (Tr1. 63) He was prescribed Wellbutrin, an antidepressant, Decampere, anti-\nalcohol, and Trazodone to help him sleep. (Tr1. 65-66) He also received psychotherapy \nfor three to ten days. (Tr1. 66) He frequently attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) \nmeetings in the 2004 to 2006 timeframe.

He attended some group meetings at a clinic and \nsome AA meetings. (Tr1. 68) He believed the treatment he was receiving was ineffective \nand a waste of time. (Tr1. 69, 118) His marriage fell apart, and he lost his job. (Tr1. 69-\n70, 119) These factors contributed to his relapse. (Tr1. 69) He used alcohol to self-\nmedicate. (Tr1. 70)  \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that in about October 2013, Applicant received alcohol-related \ntreatment and completed detoxification at a clinic. The alcohol-related treatment was on \nan outpatient basis, and he went every couple of weeks. (Tr1. 71, 120) He went to the \ntreatment primarily for medication management. (Tr1. 71) An April 23, 2014 VA progress \nnote states that Appellant said he had a relapse in October 2013. (GE 5 at 11) \u201cThe \nincident led his employer to require him to complete an alcohol rehabilitation program \nprior to returning to work. He completed [a program] and is currently active in Alcoholics \nAnonymous.\u201d (Id.) The note does not describe \u201cthe incident.\u201d The April 23, 2014 VA \nprogress note states Applicant had consumed alcohol before his VA appointment and \nApplicant believed it was unsafe for him to drive home in his vehicle. (Id. at 16) The VA \ncalled a cab, which took him from the VA to his residence. (Id.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges that from November 20 to 25, 2013, Applicant received alcohol-\nrelated inpatient treatment from a clinic, and he was diagnosed with Alcohol Use Disorder \n(moderate, in early remission), Major Depressive Disorder, and Cluster B personality \ntraits. Applicant agreed with the summary in SOR \u00b6 1.d. (Tr1. 73, 121; SOR response) \nThe therapy at the clinic entailed attending classes and AA meetings. (Tr1. 74) He \nindicated that he was sober for two years in November 2013.

(Tr1. 147-148) After he was confronted with the progress note, he said, \n\u201cYes, and I don\u2019t, I don't know where that\u2019s coming from.

(Tr1. 123)  \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges that from November 25, 2013, to about January 1, 2014, \nApplicant received 37 days of residential treatment for Anxiety, PTSD, and Depression at \na clinic. Applicant agreed with the summary in SOR \u00b6 1.e. (Tr1. 74; SOR response) He \nsuccessfully completed the treatment program. (Tr1. 123) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges that from about January 10, 2014, to about January 14, 2014, \nApplicant received Alcohol Detox treatment at a VA medical center. He did not recall \nwhether he had a relapse after leaving the clinic on January 1, 2014. (Tr1. 75) He did not \nremember whether there was a triggering event for his relapse. (Tr1. 123) The treatment \nin January 2014 may have been for aftercare rather than detox. (Tr1. 75) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges that from about March 3, 2014, to about May 2014, Applicant \nreceived treatment at a VA hospital for PTSD, Major Depressive Disorder (Recurring with \nModerate Severity), Alcohol Use Disorder (Severe), and Mild Neurocognitive Disorder \nrelated to TBI. Applicant sought treatment at the VA hospital because \u201ceverything kind of \nstarted falling apart.\u201d (Tr1. 76) He remembered being at the VA hospital; however, he \ncould not remember too much about what occurred there. (Tr1. 77) VA treatment records \nfor May 2014 indicate he was drinking 12-18 beers a day. (GE 5 at 15-16; AE P at 7) He \nhad attended rehabilitation for alcohol on five previous occasions. (AE P at 7) Before his \n11 am appointment on May 8, 2014, he had consumed three beers. (GE 5 at 16; AE P at \n12) \nOn August 23, 2014, Applicant\u2019s insurance company called the police and \ninformed them that Applicant was at his residence; he was suffering from alcohol \npoisoning; and the caller requested a welfare check. (GE 3 at 31-32) The police entered \nhis residence and observed garbage, beer cans, and fecal matter strewn about his \nresidence. (Id.) Applicant was transported to a VA medical center. (Id.) This incident is \nnot listed in the SOR, and it will not be considered for disqualification purposes. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleges that from about December 16, 2014, to about December 24, \n2017, Applicant received treatment from the VA for Alcohol Use Disorder, and he received \nalcohol detoxification. He failed to follow treatment advice to refrain from alcohol use. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i alleges that from about February 2017 to about May 2017, Applicant \nreceived inpatient hospitalization at a VA hospital for PTSD.

(Tr1. 78) He finally accepted that he was an alcoholic and \nhe needed to take sobriety one day at a time. (Tr1. 79, 98) A March 29, 2017, VA Disability \nBenefits Questionnaire states, \u201cAlcohol is drug of choice. Became a problem in 2005 \nwhen he returned from Egypt.

Currently has been abstinent since 2 January 2017.\u201d \n(AE Q at 98)  \nSOR \u00b6 1.j alleges that on March 18, 2021, a licensed psychologist, Dr. B, evaluated \nApplicant\u2019s mental health at the request of security officials. Dr. B diagnosed Applicant \nwith PTSD, Major Depressive Disorder (Moderate, Recurrent), Generalized Anxiety \nDisorder, and Alcohol Use Disorder (Severe). (GE 4 at 7) Dr. B is a clinical psychologist. \n(GE 4 at 7) Applicant said he remembered taking a test on-line; however, he did not \nremember Dr. B\u2019s interview of him. (Tr1. 80-81) He said he was \u201ca little guarded\u201d during \nthe interview because he \u201cdidn\u2019t know what this was about\u201d and, he \u201cdidn\u2019t know that [he] \nhad to fight to keep [his] clearance again.\u201d (Tr1. 81) He denied that he lied to Dr. B. (Tr1. \n82) Dr. B noted that Applicant told another evaluator that in 2016 his last drink was in \n2016; however, he told Dr. B that his last drink was in 2014. (Tr1. 82) Applicant said he \ndid not \u201crecall that.\u201d (Tr1. 82) He was upset when he read Dr. B\u2019s report because of the \ncomments about his lack of candor. (Tr1. 153-154) \nDr. B noted that Applicant \u201cmaintained the belief that he had a brief bout of \nsubstance abuse treatment at the VA in 2014 and that he has been sober ever since.\u201d \n(GE 4 at 6) He relapsed after 2014. (Id.) He omitted disclosure of alcohol-related \ntreatment from February to May 2017 at a VA facility. (Id. at 4, 6) She indicated Applicant \n\u201chas a history of underreporting and withholding information. His tendency to omit \npertinent details of his behavioral health history may have [led] previous evaluators to \nformulate inaccurate conclusions.\u201d (Id.) Dr. B concluded that it would be imprudent to \ngrant Applicant access to classified information, and stated: \n[Applicant] is clearly a troubled man who has been using alcohol to cope \nwith severe mental health symptoms for many years. While his history of \ninpatient care and multiple responses is problematic, his poor insight and \ncandor issues are of greatest concern. The degree to which he withheld \ninformation throughout the security vetting process (2016 to present) was \nindicative of intentional concealment, which brings his overall credibility into \nquestion. (GE 4 at 7)    \nAt his hearing, Applicant said his last drink of alcohol was on November 3, 2017, \nand he has been sober for almost six years. (Tr1. 82, 89) He remembered the date \nbecause he had completed Step Four with his sponsor.

(Tr1. 160) In response to Applicant\u2019s question about \nrecommendations to ensure he does not relapse or his PTSD manifest does not itself in \na negative way, Dr. W said he should receive psychotherapy to help with the traumatic \nevents he experienced in childhood and during his military service.

(Tr1. 84, 144) No one ever told him that it was okay to omit \ninformation on the SCA and provide the information later to an investigator. (Tr1. 145) \nApplicant believed when he was completing the SCA, if he answered, yes, then he \nwould not be able to proceed on the form without providing specific information. (Tr1. 85) \nAlso, the form cannot be saved, and an applicant must restart the form if it is not \ncompleted.

(Tr1. 145-146) He did not have any draft SCA \nforms. (Tr1. 146) He did not remember ever being referred for alcohol counseling. (Tr1. \n146-147) However, a treatment note indicates he was referred for alcohol treatment or \ncounseling. (Tr1. 147; AE H at 21) He said the treatment note was accurate except for \nthe part about having to go to alcohol treatment to keep his job. (Tr1. 150) \nAccording to Applicant\u2019s August 8, 2016 OPM personal subject interview (PSI), he \ninitially told the investigator that he stopped consuming alcohol in late 2014; however, he \nsaid he most recently drank a beer in June 2016. (GE 2 at 18) He was asked three times \nto disclose additional alcohol-related treatments, and he denied additional treatments. \n(Tr1. 137-138; GE 2 at 18) Then the investigator would name a particular treatment entity, \nand Applicant would admit receiving alcohol-related treatment at that facility. (Tr1. 138; \nGE 2 at 18) He attributed his failure to disclose the treatments until the investigator \nconfronted him with the facts to his lack of recollection or inability to remember or \nalternatively to oversight and not having the details available to him at the time he was \ncompleting his SCA. (Tr1. 139; GE 2 at 18, 21) \nApplicant did not disclose his DUI offense because he was only convicted of \nreckless driving. (Tr1. 87) He said, \u201cMaybe I read the question wrong and just thought \ncharge meant the same thing as conviction. Are you a lawyer? No, I\u2019m not.\u201d (Tr1. 88) He \nis aware that there would be police reports and court records, and those records would \nbe available to investigators. (Tr1. 89) \nIn his August 17, 2016 OPM PSI, Applicant disclosed the details of his two arrests \nin September to October 2014 without being confronted with the facts. (GE 2 at 17) He \nsaid he did not list the September 2014 arrest and the DUI component of the October \n2014 arrest on his SCA due to oversight.

(Tr1. 125) Department Counsel \nraised the issue of Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose the foreclosure of his residence on his \n2016 SCA. (Tr1. 126) Applicant responded that the foreclosure was not in 2016; however, \nhe did not remember when it occurred. (Tr1. 127) A December 16, 2014 progress note \nstates that Applicant is unable to pay his mortgage and his house is in foreclosure.

Our divorce was final in 2014. In 2014, I faced numerous financial difficulties \nresulting from loss of income. I am currently rectifying many of those issues.\u201d (GE 1 at \n39) Applicant disclosed sufficient information on his SCA about \u201cfinancial difficulties\u201d to \nmitigate concerns about his foreclosure not being listed on his SCA. The foreclosure will \nnot be further discussed in this decision. \n \nIn the additional comments at the end of his SCA, Applicant said: \nRegarding Alcohol Treatment: In 2004, I entered Alcoholics Anonymous for \nthe first time, and have been going to these meeting ever since. Please note \nthat I have never been reprimanded, nor fired from any employment \nregarding my previous alcohol use. I am currently a lieutenant colonel in the \nUnited States Army Reserve and have never received any sort of punitive \naction during my tenure (1989-Present), nor have I violated my \nresponsibilities in maintaining my security clearance-now over 25 years \nholding a security clearance.

Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nAG \u00b6 22 provides alcohol consumption conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n14 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nAG \u00b6 28 provides psychological conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors;  \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \nThe record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), 22(c), 22(d), 22(e), 22(f), 28(a), 28(b), 28(c), \nand 28(d). Further details will be discussed in the mitigation analysis, infra. \nFour alcohol consumption mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 23 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \n15 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nFive psychological mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nDisqualifying Conditions \nDr. B, diagnosed Applicant with PTSD, Major Depressive Disorder (Moderate, \nRecurrent), Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Alcohol Use Disorder (Severe). He \nreceived inpatient alcohol, PTSD treatment, or detoxification or combinations of these \n16 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntreatments on multiple occasions.

Dr. B concluded that it would be \nimprudent to grant Applicant access to classified information, and stated: \n[Applicant] is clearly a troubled man who has been using alcohol to cope \nwith severe mental health symptoms for many years. While his history of \ninpatient care and multiple responses is problematic, his poor insight and \ncandor issues are of greatest concern. The degree to which he withheld \ninformation throughout the security vetting process (2016 to present) was \nindicative of intentional concealment, which brings his overall credibility into \nquestion. (GE 4 at 7)    \nDSM-5 lists 11 criteria to diagnose alcohol use disorder: \nA. A problematic pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically significant \nimpairment or distress, as manifested by at least two of the following, \noccurring within a 12-month period: \n1. Alcohol is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was \nintended. \n2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control \nalcohol use. \n3. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain alcohol, use\nalcohol, or recover from its effects. \n \n4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use alcohol. \n5. Recurrent alcohol use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations \nat work, school, or home. \n6. Continued alcohol use despite having persistent or recurrent social or \ninterpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of alcohol. \n7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or \nreduced because of alcohol use. \n8. Recurrent alcohol use in situations in which it is physically hazardous. \n9. Alcohol use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or \nrecurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been \ncaused or exacerbated by alcohol. \n10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: \na. A need for markedly increased amounts of alcohol to achieve \nintoxication or desired effect. \nb. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same \namount of alcohol. \n11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following: \na. The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for alcohol (refer to Criteria \nA and B of the criteria set for alcohol withdrawal, pp. 499-500). \nb. Alcohol (or a closely related substance, such as a benzodiazepine) \nis taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms.

In ISCR Case No. 19-00151 at 8 (App. Bd. Dec. 10, 2019) the \nAppeal Board denied a government appeal and addressed the administrative judge\u2019s \nweighing of conflicting expert psychological opinions as follows: \nA Judge is required to weigh conflicting evidence and to resolve such \nconflicts based upon a careful evaluation of factors such as the comparative \nreliability, plausibility, and ultimate truthfulness of conflicting pieces of \nevidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No.05-06723 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 4, 2007). \nA Judge is neither compelled to accept a DoD-required psychologist\u2019s \ndiagnosis of an applicant nor bound by any expert\u2019s testimony or report. \nRather, the Judge has to consider the record evidence as a whole in \ndeciding what weight to give conflicting expert opinions. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 98-0265 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 17, 1999) and ISCR Case No. 99-\n0288 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2000). In this case, the Judge\u2019s conclusion \nthat the magnitude and recency of Dr. Y\u2019s contacts with Applicant in \ncombination with other corroborating evidence merited more weight than \nthe uncorroborated opinions of Dr. K and Dr. B is sustainable. \nDr. B placed significant weight on Applicant\u2019s statement during her interview, which \nwas inconsistent with the information in his medical and other records. He admitted he \nwas guarded in his response to her questions. She concluded he was not a reliable \nreporter of his symptoms, history of alcohol use, and behavior. However, Dr. B\u2019s report \nreceives less weight because her contact with Applicant was limited to a single interview. \n18 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDr. W\u2019s and Dr. G\u2019s evaluations and prognosis of Applicant receive the most \nweight. They are more recent than Dr. B\u2019s evaluation and involved much greater contact \nand involvement with Applicant. Dr. W had 26 sessions with Applicant over the previous \n5 \u00bd months. Dr. W diagnosed him with PTSD. She said he is dedicated to attendance at \nAA meetings. She does not believe Applicant has consumed alcohol in the last six \nmonths. She concurred with Dr. G, that Applicant\u2019s \u201calcoholism is in remission and that \nhe has met all [of] his treatment goals and objectives.\u201d (AE TT) Their prognosis receives \nless weight because they did not review his medical records. \nApplicant said his last drink of alcohol was on November 3, 2017, and he has been \nsober for almost six years. He said he completed AA Step Four. The problem here is a \npersistent concern that Applicant is minimizing his symptoms to obtain a security \nclearance. See Personal Conduct discussion, infra. See also ISCR Case No. 22-00657 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 18, 2023) (The Appeal Board set aside a favorable drug involvement \nand substance misuse finding and stated, \u201cWhen the record contains a basis to question \nan applicant\u2019s credibility, the Judge \u2018should address that aspect of the record explicitly,\u2019 \nexplaining why he finds an applicant\u2019s explanation to be trustworthy. Here, the basis to \nquestion Applicant\u2019s credibility rested in the Judge\u2019s unfavorable findings under Guideline \nE. It is well settled that falsification of a security questionnaire constitutes misconduct that \ncasts serious doubt on an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness.\u201d (citations \nomitted)). \nApplicant\u2019s statements about such a lengthy period of abstinence were not \nsufficiently corroborated. For example, he did not provide statements from friends, family, \ncoworkers, or AA participants describing such a lengthy period of sobriety. He did provide \ncorroboration from a coworker and his fianc\u00e9 about more recent periods of abstinence of \nthree years and one year, respectively. He provided sufficient information to support more \nthan one year of sobriety, which under DSM-5 standards establishes sustained remission. \nBased on Dr. W and Dr. G\u2019s statements and his corroborating witnesses, AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b), \n23(d), and 29(b) apply. Alcohol consumption and psychological conditions security \nconcerns are mitigated. \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 provides one personal conduct condition that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in relation to her provision of inaccurate information on \nher SCA: \n19 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant did not disclose on his June 20, 2016 SCA that he sought counseling or \ntreatment as a result of his use of alcohol. In the Optional Comment section he said, \u201cI \nattend AA meetings regularly. Spoke with a VA psychiatrist in 2011 regarding alcohol use \nrelated to PTSD issues.\u201d (Tr1. 136; GE 1 at 35) Clearly, he read the question and his \noptional comment minimizes the extent of his alcohol counseling and treatment. His June \n20, 2016 SCA also asks \u201cIn the past seven (7) years have you been charged, convicted, \nor sentenced of a crime in any court?\u201d He failed to disclose that he was charged with DUI \nin September and October 2014. These questions are straight forward and easy to \nunderstand. Applicant has a Ph.D., and he is clearly intelligent. He knew his answers \nwere false at the time he provided them. \n\u201cApplicant\u2019s statements about his intent and state of mind when he executed his \nSecurity Clearance Application were relevant evidence, but they [are] not binding on the \nAdministrative Judge.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-09488 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2006) (citation \nomitted). In ADP Case No. 17-03932 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 14, 2019), the Appeal Board \nrecognized the importance of circumstantial evidence of intent in falsification cases: \nWhen evaluating the deliberate nature of an alleged falsification, a Judge \nshould consider the applicant\u2019s mens rea in light of the entirety of the record \nevidence. See, e.g., ADP Case No. 15-07979 at 5 (App. Bd. May 30, 2017). \nAs a practical matter, a finding regarding an applicant\u2019s intent or state of \nmind may not always be based on an applicant\u2019s statements, but rather may \nrely on circumstantial evidence. Id. \nApplicant elected not to disclose negative information on his SCA. The record \nevidence establishes AG \u00b6 16(a) in relation to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a through 3.c. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n20 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nApplicant was not honest and candid during his OPM PSI, Dr. B\u2019s interview, and \nat his hearing. At his OPM PSI, he was asked three times about his alcohol treatment, he \nwould not disclose additional information, and then each time the OPM investigator would \nfollow up with information confronting Applicant about his alcohol treatment. After he was \nconfronted with the information, he admitted the additional alcohol-related treatment. \nDuring Dr. B\u2019s interview, he said he was abstinent from alcohol consumption since 2014, \nand his medical records showed alcohol consumption in 2016 and 2017. At his hearing, \nhe claimed his employer never urged him to attend alcohol treatment and he was never \nfired for reasons of alcohol consumption. His medical records contradict his claims. His \nmedical records are given greater weight than his statement at his hearing because he \nwas seeking medical assistance and treatment, and he was motivated to be honest. The \nmedical evidence is more contemporaneous with the actions of his employers. In ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five \ncircumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating: \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation;  \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.  \nId.

Arguably, these false statements might be \nmitigated by the passage of time. However, Applicant did not honestly and candidly \nprovide security relevant information to Dr. B, to the OPM investigator (before being \nconfronted with the facts), and at his hearing. I have lingering concerns that his judgment \nerrors are likely to recur and continue to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. Personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount \nconcern. The adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in \nconsidering the whole-person concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the \ntotality of his or her acts, omissions, and motivations as well as various other variables. \nEach case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant \ncircumstances and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the determination of whether to grant a security clearance must \nbe an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines I, G, \nand E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed \nunder those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 53-year-old program management specialist for a company which \nprovides equipment to the Army. He has held a security clearance since 1994. In 1998, \nhe received a bachelor\u2019s degree, and in 2002, he received a master\u2019s degree. In 2020, \nhe was awarded a Ph.D. He served in the Army from 1989 to 2020. He had several \ndeployments to combat zones, and he was awarded a Purple Heart, two Bronze Stars, \nand multiple impressive awards and commendations. He received a Combat Infantryman \nBadge, Expert Infantryman Badge, Ranger Tab, Air Assault Badge, Pathfinder Badge, \nand Airborne Badge. He also received PTSD and a TBI while deployed in combat zones. \nHe received a 90 percent disability rating from the VA with 70 percent disability for PTSD. \nHe honorably retired from the Army as a lieutenant colonel. \n22 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s performance evaluations are excellent. The general sense of his \ncharacter evidence is that Applicant is honest, reliable, responsible, diligent, professional, \nand trustworthy. The character evidence supports approval of Applicant\u2019s access to \nclassified information. \nThe DOD encourages employees to seek needed mental-health and alcohol-\nconsumption therapy and treatment. As set forth in AG \u00b6 27, no negative inference is \ndrawn on the basis of mental-health or alcohol-related counseling or treatment. In that \nregard, individuals are to be encouraged to seek appropriate treatment. Applicant sought \nand received inpatient and outpatient mental-health and alcohol-consumption counseling \nand treatment, and his participation in such counseling and treatments is mitigating. \nThe reasons for denial of his access to classified information are more persuasive \nat this time. As indicated under Guideline E, Applicant was not truthful on his June 20, \n2016 SCA. His claim that he did not disclose accurate information because he was waiting \nfor his follow-up OPM interview or alternatively, due to oversight, does not excuse, \nextenuate, or mitigate the false statement because he did not volunteer complete and \naccurate information during the follow-up interview. Moreover, the OPM interview was not \nsufficiently close in time to his completion of his SCA to be prompt. He was aware of the \ncomment sections on his SCA and used them; however, he did not indicate he had two \nDUI arrests and had received multiple alcohol inpatient and outpatient treatments. He did \nnot disclose on his SCA that his employer required him to receive alcohol treatment to \nretain his employment or that on one occasion, he was terminated from employment due \nto alcohol abuse. He was not truthful to Dr. B and at his security clearance hearing, which \nshows a lack of credibility, rehabilitation, and weighs against whole-person mitigation. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, \nExec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context \nof the whole person. Psychological conditions and alcohol consumption security concerns \nare mitigated; however, personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.j: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.d: \nFor Applicant \n23 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a through 3.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance at this time.

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 5, 2021, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline H (drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse), Guideline J (criminal conduct), and Guideline E \n(personal conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nimplemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on September 18, 2021 (Answer), and he \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. On March 18, 2022, Department \nCounsel amended the SOR to add an allegation numbered as \u00b6 3.d under Guideline E. \nThe case was assigned to me on November 3, 2022. The Defense Office of Hearings and \n1 \n\n \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on November 15, 2022, scheduling the matter \nfor a video teleconference hearing on December 2, 2022. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. \nAt the hearing, I admitted in evidence, without objection, Government\u2019s Exhibits \n(GE) 1 and 3 through 7. I marked but did not admit GE 2 in evidence because Department \nCounsel did not proffer it. Applicant testified and he did not submit any documentation or \ncall any witnesses. At his request, I kept the record open until December 16, 2022, for \nhim to provide documentation. He did not do so, and the record closed. DOHA received \nthe hearing transcript (Tr.) on December 12, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c and 2.a through 2.c, and he denied \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a through 3.d.

This was his only drug-related offense. He was at a social \ngathering, and he went with a friend so that the friend could obtain marijuana for \nconsumption at the gathering. The friend drove his car. He did not have marijuana on his \nperson, but the police officer found approximately an ounce of marijuana in his car. He \npled guilty to simple possession, received probation before judgment, and the charge was \nsubsequently expunged. He discussed this incident during his June 2019 background \ninterview, and he stated therein, reiterated in his Answer, and testified that he did not \ndisclose this arrest on his 2019 SCA due to oversight. He completed the SCA within two \nto three hours and he did not give it the appropriate attention that he should have. \n(Answer; Tr. at 31-38, 44-45, 82-98, 100-102, 107; GE 1, 3) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn July 2006, Applicant completed an FD-316, or \u201cAccess of Non-FBI personnel to \nFBI Facilities Background Data Information Form.\u201d After he completed the form, he was \narrested and charged with possession and intent to distribute marijuana, as discussed \nabove. He maintained that he did not falsify the FD-316 form because he had not yet \nbeen arrested when he completed it. In September 2006, the FBI denied Applicant \u201c. . . \naccess to FBI facilities, due to drug-related arrests that were not indicated\u201d on his July \n2006 FD-316.

He reiterated that he completed the SCA \nwithin two to three hours and he did not give it the appropriate attention that he should \nhave. He only remembered that his access to FBI facilities had been granted when he \ncompleted the 2019 SCA and he forgot that it had been previously denied, as discussed \nabove. (Answer; Tr. at 31-38, 82-98, 117; GE 1, 3, 5-7) \nApplicant first consumed alcohol in high school. In approximately 2012, Applicant \nwas arrested and charged with driving under the influence (DUI). This was his first DUI. \nHe stated that he consumed a beer at a hockey game and then went to a bar for dinner, \nwhere he consumed another beer and a shot of liquor. He drove home, which was less \nthan a mile from the bar. His blood alcohol content (BAC) was .11%. The charge was \nnolle prosequi and he received six weeks of court-ordered alcohol treatment. He \ndiscussed this DUI during his June 2019 background interview, and he indicated therein \nthat he did not disclose this DUI on his 2019 SCA because he mistakenly believed he \nwas not required to since it occurred more than seven years prior. He reiterated that he \ncompleted the SCA within two to three hours and he did not give it the appropriate \nattention that he should have. (Tr. at 49-52, 82-85, 106-107, 113-114; GE 3, 4) \nIn approximately June 2014, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. This \nwas his second DUI. He was at a sports bar with several co-workers and his former \nsupervisor after attending his father\u2019s memorial service. He consumed approximately four \ndouble mixed drinks and drove home. His BAC was .16%. In October 2014, he pled guilty \nto misdemeanor DUI and was sentenced to three days in jail and one year of probation. \nHe was ordered to complete an 18-week court-ordered outpatient alcohol treatment \nprogram and abstain from alcohol during his year of probation. He consumed alcohol on \none occasion and consequently failed a drug test, but then abided by the court\u2019s order \nand successfully completed the program and probation. He disclosed this DUI on his 2019 \nSCA and discussed it during his June 2019 background interview. Since this DUI, he \nconsumes only a couple of beers at home or when he is entertaining clients approximately \nonce monthly. (Tr. at 52-63, 82-85, 107-108; GE 1, 3, 4) \nApplicant last used marijuana and cocaine in 2017. He reached a turning point \nafter he lost his father and girlfriend in 2014 and 2017, respectively. His girlfriend of three \nyears, who was not a drug user, died of an accidental overdose after she snorted a pain \npill that, unbeknownst to her, contained fentanyl.

As of the date of the hearing, \nhis seven-year-old niece and his brother, who previously provided him with and used \nillegal drugs, lived with him. He stated that his brother was two years clean and part of a \nNarcotics Anonymous (NA) program. He stated that he has no future intention to use \nmarijuana or other illegal drugs, and that if he were to find himself in a situation where \nillegal drugs were being used, he would leave. He stated that he learned from the 2019 \nsecurity clearance process the effect that any criminal involvement would have on his \ncareer, and he was committed to not doing anything that would jeopardize it. (Answer; Tr. \nat 45-47, 63-82, 98-99, 102-106, 108-117; GE 1, 3) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \n4 \n\nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes the following applicable conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 25: \n(a) any substance misuse . . . ; and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant used marijuana and cocaine from 2006 to 2017, and he was arrested in \n2006 and charged with possession and intent to distribute marijuana. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and \n25(c) is established. \nConditions that could mitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse security \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 26. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used. \nI find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), 26(b)(1), and 26(b)(2) are established. Applicant\u2019s sole \ndrug-related offense occurred in 2006, 17 years ago, and more than five years have \npassed since he last used illegal drugs. He disclosed information about his illegal drug \nuse on his 2019 SCA and during his 2019 background interview. He testified that he no \nlonger socialized with individuals who use illegal drugs, and he had no intention to use \nillegal drugs in the future. The record evidence resolves doubts about Applicant\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. I found Applicant to be candid and credible at \nthe hearing. He has taken responsibility for his past drug use and he is committed to \nremaining drug free. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct as: \n\u201c[c]riminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \u201c(b) evidence (including, but not limited \nto, a credible allegation, an admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, \nregardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.\u201d \nApplicant was arrested in 2006 and charged with possession and intent to \ndistribute marijuana. He was also charged in 2012 with DUI and convicted in 2014 of DUI. \nAG \u00b6 31(b) is established. \nAG \u00b6 32 provides the following relevant mitigating conditions: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nAs previously stated, 17 years have passed since his drug-related charge. Nine to \neleven years have passed since his 2012 DUI charge and his 2014 DUI conviction. He \nwas candid and sincere at the hearing and he accepted responsibility. He disclosed his \n2014 DUI on his 2019 SCA and discussed it during his June 2019 background interview. \nI find that enough time has elapsed since his criminal behavior and without recurrence of \n6 \n\ncriminal activity, and the record evidence does not cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) are established. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity. \nApplicant does not socialize with individuals who use illegal substances. His \nprevious roommate, who he sees on occasion, no longer uses drugs, and his brother that \nlives with him, who previously provided him with and used illegal drugs, has been two \nyears clean and part of an NA program. AG \u00b6 16(g) is not established. \nApplicant credibly testified that he did not deliberately falsify his 2006 FBI FD-316 \nbecause his 2006 drug-related arrest and charge occurred after he completed the form, \nand there is no evidence in the record to contradict his testimony. He also credibly testified \nthat he did not deliberately falsify his 2019 SCA when he disclosed only that his access \nto FBI facilities had been granted in approximately 2008 and only his most recent DUI in \n2014. He completed the SCA within two to three hours and he did not give it the \nappropriate attention that he should have, and he did not also disclose his 2006 drug-\nrelated and 2012 DUI charges, or his 2006 denial of access to FBI facilities, due to \noversight. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H, J, and E in \nmy whole-person analysis. I had the opportunity to observe Applicant\u2019s demeanor during \nhis hearing and found that he was credible, candid, and remorseful. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me without questions or doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. I conclude Applicant mitigated the drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, criminal conduct, and personal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a - 3.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

On November 12, 2021, the \nDefense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications \nServices (CAS), previously known as the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him under \nExecutive Order (Exec.

Department Counsel indicated \nthe Government was prepared to proceed on February 3, 2022. Because of health \nprotection protocols associated with COVID-19, hearings were essentially placed on hold. \nThe case was assigned to me on August 17, 2022. A Notice of Microsoft Teams Video \nTeleconference Hearing was issued on September 23, 2022, and I convened the hearing \nas scheduled on October 13, 2022. \nDuring the hearing, Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 4 and Applicant \nExhibits (AE) A through AE F were marked and admitted into evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified. The transcript (Tr.) of the hearings was received on October 25, 2022. \nI kept the record open until November 10, 2022, to enable Applicant to supplement it.

After a complete and thorough review of the evidence \nin the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas an electronics technician or troubleshooter since October 2019. He was previously \nemployed by another employer initially as a Geek Squad consultant and then as an \nadvanced repair agent (October 2014 \u2013 October 2019).

Applicant \nreceived those student loans to enable him to obtain degrees in 2012 and 2015. He \nindicated that the student loan issue arose in 2016 when he was confronted with \ninsufficient income following graduation to enable him to maintain both a reasonable \nquality of life while his wife was unemployed and disabled, and to address his student \nloans. His wife has had significant physical and psychological medical issues since at \nleast December 2013. In 2017, she was granted supplemental security income eligibility \nby the Social Security Administration, but because of her insufficient work credit and \nApplicant\u2019s income, other than a one-time payment of about $9,000, she does not receive \nany funds. (AE F; Tr. at 20-21) \nHe acknowledged that he made a decision not to address the student loans to \navoid encountering more significant financial struggles in the short term. Although the \nsituation regarding the federal student loans had continued at the time he submitted his \nSF 86, he intended to contact someone to establish a loan rehabilitation agreement under \nterms related to his income level. As for the university student loan, he stated that he had \nalready entered into a rehabilitation agreement with the loan processor to rehabilitate that \nstudent loan after nine months of regular payments. (GE 1 at 40-43) \nOn February 17, 2021, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator with the U.S. \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). During that interview, he disclosed and \ndescribed a substantial number of delinquent student loans: 12 loans with the U.S. \nDepartment of Education (DOE) totaling $72,106, and one loan with a university for \n$13,277. Those student loans became delinquent starting in June 2016 when he was \nunable to make his $630 monthly payments for all but the university loan for which the \nmonthly payment was $130. Because of his failure to make timely payments, after a \nperiod of about 90 days, most of his student loans were assigned to the DOE, eventually \ndesignated as defaulted loans, and placed for collection. The one remaining student loan \n\u2013 the one from the university \u2013 became past due and was placed for collection. \nApplicant did not claim that he had sought either different payment arrangements \nor either deferment or forbearance. He did not report any specific factors, other than \ninadequate employment and insufficient income that might have led to his financial \nsituation. He was unable to determine when he would be able to make payments on his \ndelinquent student loans, but indicated he would contact his creditor in an effort to set up \na payment plan with an amount that he can afford. (GE 4 at 6-10) The investigator offered \nhim the opportunity to provide financial documentation both during the interview and for \nfive days after the interview. He failed to do so. (GE 4 at 11) \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant acknowledged that upon exiting from school \nwith his degree he anticipated that he would find the employment he expected. What he \nfound was financial desperation with due dates for payments in amounts that he had no \nway of satisfactorily making. He had great difficulty, \u201ceither through a failure of personal \nwillpower or that of financial power, sometimes a combination of the two, to come to a \nreconciliation with them.\u201d He ignored the problem for several years, but never forgot about \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nit. Instead, he \u201cemotionally distanced\u201d himself from it. He now understands that the correct \naction would have been to reach out and contact someone to find the available resources \nto work out reasonable payment options, but instead, he fell into a state of panic, and \n\u201cdeliberately chose to ignore the problem.\u201d Once he realized what he had done, it was \nsimply too late to take the correct action. (Answer at 2) \nOnce he started focusing on his security clearance eligibility, he realized his \nprevious poor financial choices. Unfortunately, his focus was interrupted by over a year\u2019s \nworth of medical issues for both himself and his wife, \u201ctightening\u201d his finances even \nfurther. He is currently making payments on several medical bills. (Medical Statements, \nattached to Answer; AE D) After looking at the SF 86, he realized it was time to come to \nterms with his financial situation. He reached out to his two student-loan creditors. Dealing \nwith the DOE was difficult, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, because the \nwebsite was difficult to work with and the 800 number was not always responsive. (Tr. at \n35-36) The DOE initially said that he was no longer eligible for an income-based \nrepayment plan, but the creditor of the university Perkins student loan was easier to deal \nwith and it agreed to enter into a Rehabilitation Agreement. (Answer at 2; AE I; Tr. at 28-\n29)  \nCommencing in July 2020 \u2013 nearly a year and one-half before the SOR was issued \n\u2013 pursuant to the Rehabilitation Agreement, Applicant made nine automatic monthly \npayments of $116.68 to rehabilitate the university Perkins student loan. In April 2021, the \nmonthly payments changed to $146.98, and he has remained in compliance with the \nagreed arrangements by making those automatic monthly payments for the rehabilitated \n(and no longer delinquent) Perkins student loan to at least as recently as mid-October \n2022. By October 8, 2022, the payoff amount of the Perkins student loan had been \nreduced to approximately $11,178. (AE B; AE G; AE H; AE I; AE J; Tr. at 26-28) \nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) \nAct \u2013 the original coronavirus emergency relief bill \u2013 temporarily paused payments and \ninvoluntary collections on most federally held student loans through September 30, 2020. \nThe pause was subsequently extended until December 31, 2022. (DOE Press Release, \nAugust 24, 2022) On April 6, 2022, the DOE announced an initiative called \u201cFresh Start\u201d \nto help eligible borrowers whose loans were in default. Among the benefits of the new \nprogram were that the CARES relief pause would continue, collection efforts would cease, \nand wages would not be garnished. On October 20, 2022, the DOE informed Applicant \nof the CARES Act and the Fresh Start, and started communications with him about loan \nrehabilitation and/or reinstatement. (AE K; AE C) He looks forward to being able to open \nnegotiations on trying to bring the defaulted student loans back into good standing under \nthe two newly announced programs. (Tr. at 33) As of October 8, 2022, the total debt \nbalance for his delinquent student loans held by the DOE was approximately $72,113. \n(AE C) \nThe SOR alleged the 13 then still-delinquent student-loan accounts totaling \napproximately $85,383, as set forth below: \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nThere are 12 delinquent student-loan accounts held by the DOE that were placed \nfor collection with the following unpaid balances: $11,096; $9,068; $8,872; $7,781; \n$6,360; $6,253; $6,166; $4,522; $4,253; $3,165; $2,475; and $2,095.

(AE A; AE E) The PFS gave \nhim some ideas on how he might improve his saving and spending under a budget. (Tr. \nat 31) \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling. (Tr. at 32) Applicant\u2019s current focus \nis on paying off his family medical bills and his Perkins student loan, and arriving at a \nreasonable monthly payment on a consolidation of his remaining student loans held by \nthe DOE. With his newly acquired paradigm of full fiscal responsibility and accountability \nwith regard to his delinquent student loans, there is clear evidence to indicate that his \nfinancial problems are now under control, and he is currently in a better position financially \nthan he had been. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe SOR alleged 13 still-delinquent student-loan accounts totaling approximately \n$85,383. Applicant admitted that at the time the SOR was issued he had the 12 delinquent \nstudent loans held by the DOE and he acknowledged the one rehabilitated Perkins \nstudent loan. He contended that the situation was brought about essentially because of \ninsufficient income that left him unable to make student-loan payments and maintain a \nreasonable quality of life while his wife was unemployed and disabled. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and \n19(c) have been established, but there is no evidence to indicate an unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts regardless of an ability to do so, and AG \u00b6 19(b) is not established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) apply, but none of the other conditions applies. The \nstudent loan issue arose in 2016. Applicant had insufficient income following graduation \nto pay his student loans and maintain a reasonable quality of life because his wife was \nunemployed and disabled with significant physical and psychological medical issues. He \nmade a decision not to address the student loans to avoid encountering more significant \nfinancial struggles in the short term. As a result, his student loans were eventually \ndesignated as defaulted loans, and placed for collection. He did not claim that he had \nsought either different payment arrangements or either deferment or forbearance. He \nsimply said that inadequate employment and insufficient income led to his financial \nsituation. He had great difficulty, \u201ceither through a failure of personal willpower or that of \nfinancial power, sometimes a combination of the two, to come to a reconciliation with \nthem.\u201d He ignored the problem and \u201cemotionally distanced\u201d himself from it for several \nyears, but never forgot about it. He now understands that the correct action would have \nbeen to reach out and contact someone to find the available resources to work out \nreasonable payment options, but instead, he fell into a state of panic, and \u201cdeliberately \nchose to ignore the problem.\u201d \nWhen Applicant finally realized his previous poor financial choices, he started to \nfocus on taking corrective actions. His focus was interrupted by over a year\u2019s worth of \nmedical issues for both himself and his wife, \u201ctightening\u201d his finances even further. Well \nbefore the SOR was issued, he reached out to his two student-loan creditors. Dealing \nwith the DOE was difficult, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, because the \nwebsite was difficult to work with and the 800 number was not always responsive. The \nDOE initially said that he was no longer eligible for an income-based repayment plan, but \nthe creditor of the university Perkins student loan was easier to deal with and it agreed to \nenter into a Rehabilitation Agreement. Commencing in July 2020 \u2013 nearly a year and one-\nhalf before the SOR was issued \u2013 Applicant started making agreed automatic monthly \npayments to rehabilitate the university Perkins student loan.

With the CARES Act and Fresh Start \nprograms, he hopes his eligibility for a repayment program will be recognized so that he \ncan start making acceptable monthly payments on those student loans. \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \nBased on the evidence, it is clear that Applicant reluctantly but intentionally ignored \nhis delinquent student-loan accounts for a multi-year period. Insufficient income, his wife\u2019s \nsignificant physical and psychological medical issues, and his own medical issues, \ncaused him to make a difficult choice: maintain a reasonable lifestyle and focus on family \nhealth and welfare, or focus on paying student loans and ignoring the family welfare. He \nmade the difficult, but unpopular, choice, at least in the eyes of his creditors. His financial \nproblems were not fully under control until he made the initial efforts to finally address his \nstudent loans. Commencing in July 2020 \u2013 nearly a year and one-half before the SOR \nwas issued \u2013 Applicant started making the agreed automatic monthly payments to \nrehabilitate the university Perkins student loan. He acted responsibly by addressing his \nfamily health and welfare issues while temporarily delaying any attempt to address the \ndelinquent student-loan accounts. In fact, his earlier attempts to address the DOE-held \nstudent loans were seemingly thwarted by an inflexible refusal to accept repayment plans \nafter a certain time as well as COVID-19 pandemic protocols that made dealing with the \nDOE rather difficult. The Appeal Board has previously commented on such a situation: \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due \nto circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider \nwhether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing \nwith those financial difficulties. ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. \nJan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); \nISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \nApplicant eventually attempted to enter into a repayment plan with the DOE, but \nits refusal to accept such a plan should not be attributable to his failure to request one in \na more timely manner. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his or him financial problems only after being \nplaced on notice that his or him security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the \njudgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no \nimmediate threat to his or him own interests.

Sept. 18, 2018) In \nthis instance, Applicant offered clear evidence that he began making payments on the \nPerkins student loan nearly a year and one-half before the SOR was issued. His \nunsuccessful efforts to work with the DOE started even earlier. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, Applicant clearly stated that \nsuch efforts were made well before the SOR was issued. His first payment was made in \nJuly 2020. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \nThere is no verifiable evidence of financial counseling. Because of Applicant\u2019s \npartially successful efforts to start rehabilitating his delinquent student-loan accounts after \nseveral years of inaction, his actions under the circumstances no longer cast any doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. See ISCR Case No. 09-\n08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nThere \nis \nsome \ndisqualifying \nevidence \nregarding \nApplicant\u2019s \nfinancial \nconsiderations under the whole-person concept. His history of financial difficulties and \ndelinquent student-loan debt is well documented. The SOR alleged 13 still-delinquent \nstudent loans totaling approximately $85,383. While the issues first arose in 2016, \nApplicant did not fully address any of them until 2020. He did not claim that he had sought \neither different payment arrangements or either deferment or forbearance. He simply said \nthat inadequate employment and insufficient income led to his financial situation. He had \ngreat difficulty, \u201ceither through a failure of personal willpower or that of financial power, \nsometimes a combination of the two, to come to a reconciliation with them.\u201d He ignored \nthe problem and \u201cemotionally distanced\u201d himself from it for several years. He fell into a \nstate of panic, and \u201cdeliberately chose to ignore the problem.\u201d \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. Applicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. \nHe has been serving as an electronics technician or troubleshooter since October 2019. \nHe was previously employed by another employer initially as a Geek Squad consultant \nand then as an advanced repair agent. A 2002 high school graduate, he received an \nassociate\u2019s degree in 2012 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2015. He was married in 2010. \nApplicant\u2019s student loan issue arose in 2016. Inadequate employment and \ninsufficient income led to his financial situation following graduation. He was unable to \npay his student loans and maintain a reasonable quality of life because his wife was \nunemployed and disabled with significant physical and psychological medical issues. He \nmade a decision not to address the student loans to avoid encountering more significant \nfinancial struggles in the short term. When he finally realized his previous poor financial \nchoices, he started to focus on taking corrective actions, but his focus was interrupted by \nover a year\u2019s worth of medical issues for both himself and his wife, \u201ctightening\u201d his \nfinances even further. However, well before the SOR was issued, he reached out to his \ntwo student-loan creditors. Dealing with the DOE was difficult to work with and initially \nsaid that he was no longer eligible for an income-based repayment plan, but the creditor \nof the university Perkins student loan was easier to deal with and it agreed to enter into a \nRehabilitation Agreement. Commencing in July 2020 \u2013 nearly a year and one-half before \nthe SOR was issued \u2013 Applicant started making agreed automatic monthly payments to \n11 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrehabilitate the university Perkins student loan. He has remained in compliance with the \nagreed arrangements by making those automatic monthly payments for the rehabilitated \n(and no longer delinquent) Perkins student loan to at least as recently as mid-October \n2022. By October 8, 2022, the payoff amount of the Perkins student loan had been \nreduced to approximately $11,178. With the CARES Act and Fresh Start programs, he \nhopes his eligibility for a repayment program will be recognized so that he can start \nmaking acceptable monthly payments on those student loans. He has no other delinquent \ndebts. \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nhim] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that \nplan.\u201d The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s \nfinancial situation and his [or him] actions in evaluating the extent to which \nthat applicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is \ncredible and realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, \nshould be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement \nthat a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. \nRather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the \npayment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that \nthe first debts actually paid in furthermore of a reasonable debt plan be the \nones listed in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s track record of substantial verifiable efforts to resolve the his delinquent \nstudent-loan debts, his early successful efforts regarding his Perkins student loan, and \neven his lengthy unsuccessful efforts with the DOE, despite the period of non-contact with \nher creditors, during which he focused on family welfare rather than student loan \npayments, is positive and encouraging. Overall, the evidence leaves me without \nsubstantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. Accordingly, I conclude Applicant has successfully mitigated the security \nconcerns arising from his financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) (1) \nthrough AG 2(d) (9). \n12 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.b. through 1.m.: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n13 \n",

He has owned his home since 2010. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in \n1985 from a military academy, and a master\u2019s degree in 2007. He served in the U.S. \nmilitary from 1985 until he honorably retired in 2008. He worked for a DOD contractor \nfrom 2008 to 2010. He was self-employed from 2010 to 2015. He worked as a general \nmanager for an auto body shop from 2015 to 2019. He worked as a consultant for a DOD \ncontractor since 2019. He was first granted a security clearance as a civilian in \napproximately 1997.

(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b) In his Answer, Applicant admitted, in part, \nand denied, in part, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. The SOR allegations are established by \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, his July 2019 security clearance application (SCA), his October \n2019 interview with a background investigator, and his January 2021 and June 2021 \nresponses to interrogatories. (Answer; GE 1-3) \nApplicant attributed his failure to file his TY 2015 through 2019 federal and state \nincome tax returns to personal and professional difficulties that began in 2015, when his \nmother was diagnosed with cancer and his business dwindled due to sequestration. \nWhen he worked for the auto body shop, he continued to travel to the state in which his \nmother lived so that he could care for her. He found it difficult to manage his workload \nand personal responsibilities while also assembling the documentation needed to file his \nincome tax returns--a process further complicated by his rental properties and self-\nemployment. His tax preparer of five years also went out of business in 2016. He spent \nseveral months dealing with his mother\u2019s affairs after she lost her battle with cancer in \n2016. (Tr. at 20-25, 33-34, 35-42, 46-53, 59-67, 71-73; GE 1-3) \nApplicant initiated efforts in 2019 to find a new tax preparer, and he hired one in\napproximately October 2020. He acknowledged that he should have started these efforts \nsooner. His previous tax preparer untimely filed his federal and state income tax returns \nfor TY 2015 in October 2016, before going out of business. After his current tax preparer \nprepared his subsequent tax income tax returns, he filed them. October 2022 IRS tax \naccount transcripts reflect that he untimely filed his federal income tax returns for TY 2018 \nand 2019 in April 2022, and for TY 2016, 2017, and 2020 in October 2022. At his request, \nhe was granted an extension to file his federal income tax return for TY 2021, and he \nuntimely filed it in December 2022.

(Tr. at 19-20, 26-33; AE F, G, I, J, K, N, O) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for TY 2015 \nthrough 2019. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(c) and 19(f). \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to his financial problems. The \nfirst prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide \nevidence that he acted responsibly under his circumstances. Prior to and simultaneous \nwith filing his relevant income tax returns, he made estimated payments in federal and \nstate taxes for TY 2015 and 2016 in 2016 and 2017; he had federal and state income \ntaxes withheld from his 2016 to 2018 earnings; he made payments to the IRS in 2018, \n2020, 2021, and 2022; and he made payments to the state tax authority in 2022. He made \nefforts to find a new accountant in 2019, and he hired one in 2020, before the SOR was \nissued. He acknowledged he should have done this sooner. \nAs of the date of the hearing, Applicant\u2019s federal and state income tax returns for \nTY 2015 through 2021 were filed, and he did not have any outstanding federal or state \ntaxes. He intends to timely file his federal and state income tax returns in the future, and \nresolve any taxes owed. He understands the importance of timely filing his future income \ntax returns, and he intends to utilize the system he developed, through the process of \nfiling his delinquent returns, for gathering all his required tax documents to provide them \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nto his accountant in a timely manner. Applicant\u2019s finances, to include his tax situation, are \nunder control, and it does not continue to cast doubt on his judgment, trustworthiness, \nand reliability. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(g) are established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

(GE 1 at 9-40) \nReasons for Financial Problems \nApplicant was issued a child support order in April 2013. Following six years of \nmaking timely payments on his mortgage, his first late payment in September 2013 was \ndue to the earlier child support order. After he could not achieve an adjustment of the \nmortgage in October 2013, he listed the property for sale in November 2013. When he \ncould not execute a short-sale of the property, in June 2014, he relinquished the deed to \nthe mortgage company. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) He still owes the company late fees amounting to \nabout $35,000. The mortgage company filed a judgment in November 2016, which \nApplicant has not addressed to date. After his divorce from his first wife in March 2014, \nhe moved to another state in September 2014 to attend an aviation school. While at the \nschool, he planned to pay his expenses using his disability pay and his wife\u2019s \nanticipated salary at the school\u2019s location. He claims he graduated in June 2016, \nhowever, in his August 2019 e-QIP, he stated that he did not graduate.

He opened a cable account at a time not disclosed in the \nrecord. (Tr. 31) He purchased a car in March 2014 (Tr. 37-39). He fell behind in \npayments and the car was repossessed in late 2015.

Applicant claims he answered \u201cno\u201d because he did not have a \ncredit bureau report when he filled out the e-QIP in August 2019. (Tr 44-47) While \nlacking a credit report is a reasonable explanation for negative answers in the financial \nsection, I do not find his claim credible because he knew in August 2019 that he had \ndelinquent debts. He knew about the delinquent credit-card accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and \n1.c.

(Tr. 50-51) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of \nincome is also a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal \nactivity, including espionage. \nAG \u00b6 19.

Adverse \nevidence from credit reports can usually meet the Government\u2019s obligation of proving \ndelinquent debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02403 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015); \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) The Government\u2019s credit reports \nestablish that the debts listed in the SOR became delinquent between April 2014 and \nMay 2020. The total amount of debt posted in the SOR is $64,537. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and \n19(c) apply. AG \u00b6 19(b) applies because Applicant has provided no documentation \nverifying that he informed the creditors and collection agencies of his financial difficulties \nand his plan to fix them. When afforded opportunities to submit additional \ndocumentation showing that he paid off some debts, no documentary evidence, i.e., \npaid receipts, cancelled checks, or bank statements was submitted. \nAG \u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20 (a) is not available for mitigation because none of the financial debts \nhave been resolved. The allegation involving the child support was alleged under \npersonal conduct, not financial considerations. Several accounts were opened while \nothers were already delinquent. An example is that after the SOR \u00b6 1.a credit-card \naccount became delinquent in 2014, Applicant opened several subsequent credit or \nutility accounts that ultimately became delinquent. The account at SOR \u00b6 1.l became \ndelinquent in May 2020. It is likely that Applicant\u2019s current debt issues will persist.

These events were largely beyond \nhis control. But his decision to move to another state in 2014 with only his disability pay \nand his present wife\u2019s anticipated earnings, without investigating the expense before his \nmove, was a condition within his control. He should have examined the alternatives \nmore carefully. Overall, the lack of evidence demonstrating responsible financial \nmanagement of the listed debts results in limited mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b). \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply as Applicant has not had financial counseling and \ndoes not use a written budget. \nIn Guideline F cases, the DOHA Appeal Board has repeatedly held that, to \nestablish her case in mitigation, an applicant must present a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d \nof debt repayments that result in debt reduction. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-01920 at \n5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007). While an applicant is not required to show that every debt \nlisted in the SOR is paid, the applicant must show that he has a plan for debt resolution \nand has taken significant action to implement the plan. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-\n25499 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006). Applicant has done neither. AG \u00b6 20(d) is \nunavailable for mitigation because he has not made a good-faith effort to repay the \ndelinquent debts. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concerns related to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility: \nAG \u00b6 16. Conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts \nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n8 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant denies that the omissions of his delinquent debts in his August 2019 \ne-QIP were intentional, but resulted from not having his credit report available for \nreference when he filled out his e-QIP. Since a simple omission does not establish that \nthe conduct was intentionally committed, I must consider the entire record to determine \nwhether there is direct or circumstantial evidence that provides insight into Applicant\u2019s \nintent or state of mind when the omissions occurred. See, ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at \n4 (App. Bd. Nov.17,2004); ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010) In view of \nthe fact that Applicant was over 36 years of age when he filled out the August 2019 e-\nQIP, he had a substantial number of credits at an aviation school, and admitted the \nSOR \u00b6 2.b allegation in his undated answer, I do not find the unavailability of his credit \nreport as credible. The evidence satisfactorily supports AG \u00b6 16(a). \nAG \u00b6 17. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur. \nApplicant did not make prompt good-faith efforts to correct his intentional \nomissions of his August 2019 e-QIP until confronted with the delinquent accounts during \nhis September 2019 PSI. AG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply. Deliberately providing false \ninformation to the Government during the security clearance investigation, including the \nsubmission of fabricated confirmation numbers and dates when some of the listed debts \nwere purportedly satisfied, cannot be considered minor and reflects negatively on \nApplicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and judgment. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. \nApplicant receives only partial mitigation under AG \u00b6 17(d) for his brief but unsuccessful \nenrollment in a debt consolidation plan in November 2022. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the specific guidelines in the context of the \nnine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n9 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant is 40 years old and is raising two children with his current wife. Since \n2013, he has been dutifully paying child support for the three children from his first \nmarriage. He received an honorable discharge in March 2009 after almost nine years on \nactive duty in the USN. Applicant has worked for his current employer since 2017. In \nSeptember 2022, he was promoted to a quality assurance inspector after beginning his \nemployment as a mechanic. \nIn August 2019, Applicant provided an e-QIP falsely certifying that he had no \ndelinquent debts in the last 7 years when he knew that he had delinquent debts. His \ncredibility is seriously undermined by his misrepresentations about paying bills which he \ninitiated in his undated answer to the SOR, and perpetuated at the December 28, 2022 \nhearing, and the February 7, 2023 hearing. After a full review of the entire record from \nan overall common-sense point of view, in conjunction with the specific conditions and \ngeneral factors of the whole-person concept, Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns arising under the guidelines for financial considerations and person conduct. \n* \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.f, 1.h-1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:   \nFor Applicant. \nSubparagraph 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n10 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nPaul J. Mason \nAdministrative Judge \n11 \n",
