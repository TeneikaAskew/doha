Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on September 6, \n2016. On December 31, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns \nunder Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 4, 2019, and requested a decision on \nthe record without a hearing. On June 14, 2019, the Government sent Applicant a \ncomplete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM) including \ndocuments identified as Items 1 through 6. He was given an opportunity to submit a \ndocumentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or \nexplanation to the Government\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on June 27, 2019, \n\n \n2 \n \nand did not respond. Items 1 and 2 contain the pleadings in the case. Items 3 through 6 \nare admitted into evidence. The case was assigned to me on August 29, 2019. \n \nProcedural Matter \n \nI extracted the below findings of facts from Applicant\u2019s SOR Answer (Item 2), his \nSCA (Item 3), and a summary of his security clearance interview (SI) (Item 4). Item 4 \nwas not authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. However, I conclude that \nApplicant waived any objection to Item 4. The Government included in the FORM a \nprominent notice advising Applicant of his right to object to the admissibility of Item 4 on \nthe ground that it was not authenticated. Applicant was also notified that if he did not \nraise any objection to Item 4 in his response to the FORM, or if he did not respond to \nthe FORM, he could be considered to have waived any such objection, and that Item 4 \ncould be considered as evidence in his case. Applicant received the FORM, which \nincluded a copy of Item 4. He did not respond to the FORM or otherwise object to Item \n4.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 49, divorced his wife of 24 years in 2015. He has three children, \nages 17, 22, and 26. He has resided with a cohabitant since 2016. He honorably served \non active duty in the U.S. Navy from 1991 through 2011. He deployed to a combat zone \nin 2008 for six months. He has been taking college courses on and off since 2002, and \nhas not yet earned a degree. He has been steadily employed full time since he \nseparated from the Navy, including as a web developer on a defense contract since \n2016. He reported no prior security clearances. \n \nApplicant admitted each of the 11 debts alleged in the SOR, which totaled \n$60,232. He attributed his financial indebtedness to the divorce. The marital debts \n(which included all of SOR debts) were equally divided between the parties in the \ndivorce decree. Applicant has been paying alimony in an amount and for a duration not \nspecified in the record. The record did not address the issue of child support. As of \nFebruary 2019, Applicant had not resolved any of the SOR debts. Instead, he asserted \nthat he was \u201cworking out the details\u201d to get them resolved and planned to contact his ex-\nwife to \u201cget more information as to what it [sic] happening.\u201d (Item 2; Item 4 at 5) \n \nEach of the SOR debts were incurred during Applicant\u2019s marriage. He has not \naccrued any new debts since the divorce. The SOR did not allege the amounts charged \noff in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f through 1.h. They were, however, reported in the credit reports as \n$876, $664, and $3,674, respectively. The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g are the \nsame as those alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e. (Item 5; Item 6) \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he and his wife had difficulty living within their means, \nwhich he attributed to his military lifestyle and moving frequently. They used credit cards \nto pay for everyday living expenses. After the divorce, his ex-wife filed for bankruptcy, \nwhich Applicant stated did not include most of his debts. However, he did not \nspecifically address whether any of the SOR debts were included in the bankruptcy. The \n\n \n3 \n \ncredit reports listed only one of the SOR debts as a joint account (SOR \u00b6 1.a). The \nothers were listed as individual accounts. (Item 4 at 4; Item 5 at 3; Item 6 at 7) \n \n \nDuring his 2017 security clearance interview, Applicant acknowledged the \ndelinquent debts that were later alleged in the SOR, and promised to contact his \ncreditors to resolve them. He asserted that his salary allowed him to better manage his \nfinances and anticipated that he would have the debts resolved by the end of 2018. \n(Item 4 at 5.) He did not address, in his SOR Answer or otherwise, the reason that he \nhas not yet resolved his delinquent debts, nor has he demonstrated any progress in \nresolving them.  \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2). \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \n\n \n4 \n \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. (ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at \n3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)). Once the Government establishes a \ndisqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has \nthe burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts \nto the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)). \n \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012).  \n \n \nBecause they duplicate other alleged debts, I have found SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. As to the remaining unresolved debts, Applicant\u2019s admissions and his \ncredit reports establish two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) \n(inability to satisfy debts), and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nNone of the following potentially applicable mitigating conditions under this \nguideline are established: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20 (d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant has substantial delinquent debts that remain unresolved, despite his \ngainful employment since at least 2017. He failed to demonstrate that he acted \nresponsibly to address them. He has neither paid nor established a plan to resolve his \ndebts. Thus, I cannot conclude that Applicant has mitigated the Guideline F concerns at \nthis time.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered Applicant\u2019s \nmilitary service, including his combat tour. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated security concerns raised \nby his financial indebtedness. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of \n\n \n6 \n \nshowing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f \u2013 1.g:   \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.h \u2013 1k:   \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Under these circumstances, she has failed to mitigate the security concern.  \nClearance is denied.   \nStatement of the Case \nOn February 21, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the \nsecurity concern under Guideline K, handling protected information, explaining why it was \nunable to find it clearly consistent with the national security to grant security clearance \neligibility. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; and DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive) and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), \neffective June 8, 2017. \nOn March 11, 2019, Applicant answered the SOR, admitting in part the allegation \n\n2 \n \nand denying it in part. She requested a hearing, whereupon the case was assigned to me \non May 7, 2019.  On July 17, 2019, DOHA scheduled the case for August 8, 2019. At the \nhearing, I received three Government Exhibits, marked and admitted as GE 1 through GE \n3, one Applicant exhibit (AE A), and Applicant\u2019s testimony. Also, I incorporated a copy of \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s discovery letter to Applicant, dated April 11, 2019, into the record. \n(Hearing Exhibit I) At Applicant\u2019s request, I left the record open to enable her to submit \nadditional exhibits. Within the time allotted, her counsel submitted an additional exhibit, \nmarked and admitted as AE B. The transcript (Tr.) was received on August 30, 2019  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old married woman. She graduated from college in 1997 and \nearned a master\u2019s degree in 2007. (Tr. 49) She has worked for various federal contractors \nsince 2006. She currently is a data scientist. (Tr. 32)  She has held a security clearance \nsince 2006. (Tr. 55) \n \n \nApplicant is highly respected on the job. According to her supervisor, she is unique \nbecause she understands all of the technology that her company utilizes at an expert level. \n(Tr. 70) Moreover, she is highly security conscious, as she is typically the employee who \nasks if everyone has the necessary clearances before engaging in conversations with \nclients. (Tr. 71) \n \n \nIn March 2015, towards the end of a contract, Applicant and her coworkers were \ninstructed to clean out their work areas, pack their belongings and telework until the next \nproject started. Applicant complied with this directive, packing her personal belongings in a \nbox and taking them home. (Tr. 37) \n \n \nAbout three weeks later, in April 2015, Applicant realized that she had inadvertently \ntaken a classified CD home. (Tr. 37, 63) She immediately rendered it inoperable by \nscratching it and breaking it into several pieces. (Tr. 36). She stored the broken, inoperable \nCD in a box in her garage until approximately September 2015, after her employer \nregained access to the sensitive compartmented information facility. (Tr. 65) She then \nreturned it to the SCIF, but did not inform the facility security office that she had removed it. \nHer failure to report the return of the classified pieces of the CD stemmed from a \ncombination of fear, procrastination, and the prioritization of project work over security \nconsciousness. (GE B at 3; Tr. 37) Specifically, when she initially returned the CD, she did \nnot want to take the time to report it to the facility security officer because the process was \ntime-consuming, and she preferred to spend her time completing a project. (Tr. 38)  She \nultimately disclosed the information about the CD during a polygraph examination in \nSeptember 2016. (Tr. 38)  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \n\n3 \n \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines listpotentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied together with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive \nOrder 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;  \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n\n4 \n \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline K: Handling Protected Information \n \n \nThe security concerns about handing protected information are set forth in AG \u00b6 13: \n \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information \u2013 which includes classified and other sensitive \ngovernment information, and proprietary information \u2013 raises doubt about an \nindividual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability to \nsafeguard such information, and is a serious security concern. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct with respect to the classified CD that she took home in 2015 \ntriggers the application of AG \u00b6 34(b), \u201ccollecting or storing protected information in any \nunauthorized location, and AG \u00b6 34(g), \u201cany failure to comply with rules for the protection of \nclassified or sensitive information.\u201d Applicant\u2019s removal of the CD from her office was \ninadvertent and happened under an unusual circumstance, as she was moving out of her \noffice during the pending expiration of a contract. Conversely, although she destroyed the \nCD, she did not report the removal until she was scheduled to take a polygraph, \napproximately 18 months after she had removed it from the SCIF. This renders the \nmitigating condition in AG \u00b6 35(d), \u201cthe violation was inadvertent, it was promptly reported, \nthere is no evidence of compromise, and it does not suggest a pattern,\u201d inapplicable.  \n \n \nAlthough the nature of the circumstances surrounding the inadvertent removal of the \nCD from the SCIF was unusual, it has no bearing on Applicant\u2019s conscious decision not to \nimmediately report the violation. Moreover, given the nature and seriousness of Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity violation, not enough time has elapsed since the conduct to conclude that it is \nmitigated by the passage of time. I conclude AG \u00b6 35(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed since \nthe behavior, or it has happened so infrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that \nit is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant received annual security briefings before she committed the security \nviolation. She understood when she discovered that she had accidentally brought the CD \nhome, and later, when she returned it, but failed to surrender it to the FSO\u2019s office, that her \nactions were inconsistent with the lessons taught in the annual security briefings. AG \u00b6 \n35(c), \u201cthe security violations were due to improper or inadequate training or unclear \ninstructions,\u201d does not apply. Nevertheless, Applicant is contrite and understands that she \nmust not subordinate her security responsibilities to her work responsibilities. She has \ncontinued to attend annual security briefings from her employer. AG \u00b6 35(b), \u201cthe individual \n\n5 \n \nresponded favorably to counseling or remedial security training and now demonstrates a \npositive attitude toward the discharge of security responsibilities,\u201d applies. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nGiven the nature and seriousness of Applicant\u2019s failure to report her security \nviolation for more than a year after it occurred, it is too soon to conclude that such conduct \nmay not recur. In reaching this conclusion, I was cognizant of DOHA jurisprudence which \ntreats security violations with particular gravity, and which establishes a strict scrutiny \nstandard for evaluating mitigation. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline K:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_____________________ \nMarc E. Curry \n Administrative Judge \n",

This \nallegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n  \nApplicant has significant alleged past-due debt. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthese disqualifying conditions.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant has made a good-faith effort to address all of her alleged past-due \nindebtedness, which can be attributed to two failed marriages. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 \nhas been established. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \n\n \n6 \n \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated \nthe Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a.~1.n:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn January 9, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations (the SOR was incorrectly styled as an ADP case, but based upon \nrepresentations by Department Counsel, it was determined that it should properly be \nconsidered as an ISCR case). The DOD acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \neffective June 8, 2017 (AG). \n \nApplicant answered (Answer) the SOR on February 27, 2019, and he requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on September 9, 2019, and the hearing was \n\n \n2 \n \nconvened as scheduled on September 24, 2019. The Government offered exhibits (GE) \n1 through 6, which were admitted into evidence without objection. The Government\u2019s \nexhibit list was identified as hearing exhibit (HE) I. Applicant testified and offered one \nexhibit (AE A), which was admitted without objection. The record remained open until \nOctober 11, 2019, to allow Applicant to submit documentary evidence. He submitted AE \nB-C, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) \non October 21, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations, with explanations, and his admissions \nare incorporated into these findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and \nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began working \nat his present job in 2017. He is a high school graduate, has attended firefighter I and II \ncourses, and is certified as an emergency medical technician (EMT). He currently \nperforms duties as an emergency responder to workmen who deal with hazardous \nmaterial at their work site. He married in 2001 and divorced in 2015. He has three \nchildren, ages 18, 11, and 9. The oldest has special needs. Applicant and his ex-wife \nworked out an informal child-support arrangement. (Tr. 8, 24-25, 28-29; GE 1) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in \nNovember 2018, which listed his total liabilities at approximately $66,000. The SOR \nwent on to allege seven charged-off or collection accounts listed in the bankruptcy. The \nSOR also alleged that Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy petition disclosed that he owed federal \ntaxes in an unknown amount to the IRS.  \n \n \nApplicant credibly testified that he married young and started a family. He put \nhimself through firefighters\u2019 and EMT school at a total cost of approximately $7,000 \nwithout incurring any loan debt. His financial troubles began in approximately 2015 \nwhen he was laid off from a well-paying firefighter job with a railroad company. He filed \nto receive unemployment benefits, but his appeal was denied. He also went through his \ndivorce in 2015. This required him to start a second household for himself thereby \nincurring new expenses. He also incurred half of the marital debt from the divorce \nsettlement. He gained employment in the private sector, but was unable to pay his \nobligations. (Tr. 20, 25-27, 31; AE A) \n \n \nAfter struggling to pay his debts, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy \nprotection in November 2018. All the debts listed in the SOR were included in the \npetition. Applicant\u2019s 2018 federal tax return refund was intercepted and applied to the \nbankruptcy costs and debts. Applicant is current on all his federal income tax filings and \npayments. His debts were discharged by the bankruptcy court in September 2019. \nApplicant\u2019s September 2019 credit report shows that he is current on all his debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial statement from November 2018 shows that he has approximately \n$1,400 left over monthly after paying his expenses and other obligations. He has a \nsavings account with approximately $3,000. He has no credit cards. He received \n\n \n3 \n \nfinancial counseling through his bankruptcy case and used that knowledge to develop a \nmonthly budget. (Tr. 23, 32-37; GE 2; AE B-C) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \n\n \n4 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n \nApplicant had debts discharged in 2019 through bankruptcy. I find both the above \ndisqualifying conditions are raised.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s incurred debts that he was unable to resolve because of his \nunemployment and his divorce, which were conditions beyond his control. He used \nbankruptcy to discharge the listed debts. He has recovered financially, has established \na budget, and is now current on all his financial obligations. All the above mitigating \nconditions have some applicability. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.       \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. I \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s federal contractor service, his unemployment, his divorce, and \nthe circumstances surrounding his indebtedness.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs: 1.a - 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn January 9, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 18, 2019, and elected to have her case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on April 13, \n2018. She was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \n\n \n2 \n \n \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. The Government\u2019s \nevidence is identified as Items 1 through 7. Applicant did not provide a response to the \nFORM, object to the Government\u2019s evidence, or submit documents. The Items are \nadmitted into evidence. The case was assigned to me on July 10, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted both SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 45 years old. She is a high school graduate and earned some college \ncredits, but not a degree. She married in 1994 and divorced in 2002. She has two children \nfrom the marriage, ages 24, and 17 years old. She remarried in 2003, divorced in 2008, \nand remarried her third husband in 2010. She has been employed by federal contractors \nsince 2014 and the same contractor since July 2016. (Item 3)  \n \nApplicant disclosed on her April 2017 security clearance application (SCA) that \nshe failed to file and pay her 2006, 2007, and 2008 federal income tax returns. She \nadmitted that there are two federal tax liens filed against her for 2012 ($11,798) and 2011 \n($49,515). (Any derogatory information that was not alleged will not be considered for \ndisqualifying purposes, but may be considered when analyzing Applicant\u2019s credibility, in \nthe application of mitigating conditions, and in a whole-person analysis.) (Item 3) \n \nApplicant indicated in the SCA that her second husband was an abusive man, who \nrefused to allow her to file their taxes or have control over her finances. She said she had \nfiled several Offers in Compromise with the IRS, but did not know what she was doing. \nDocuments in the record reflect some documents were filed with the IRS in approximately \n2010, 2014, and 2015, but some were incomplete and required more information. Another \ndocument from the IRS indicated it closed its file because there were other investigations \npending that could impact her liability. Applicant stated that she had previously hired a \ntax company to help her settle the tax debts, but it took her money and did not assist her. \nShe said that she has hired a new company to resolve the matter. She said she has been \ntrying for years to resolve the tax debts and the new company was going to do that. (Item \n3) \n \nDuring Applicant\u2019s April 2018 background investigation, she acknowledged she \nowed approximately $70,000 in taxes and was working with a tax company to arrange a \npayment plan. She said her ex-husband did not file their tax returns. She was gathering \nthe paperwork to file another Offer in Compromise with the IRS. (Item 7) \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she stated she has been trying since 2009 to \nobtain an Offer in Compromise with the IRS. She said a new offer was completed and \nbeing filed. She said at the time her tax returns were due, she was unaware her ex-\nhusband had not timely filed them. Applicant did not provide documentary evidence of \nany current attempt to resolve her tax liens. (Item 2) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state or local income tax as \nrequired.  \n \n \nApplicant has two federal tax liens that were filed in 2011 and 2012 and remain \nunresolved. She has been aware of her tax liability since at least 2009. There is sufficient \nevidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n\n \n5 \n \n \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed or is in compliance with those arrangements.  \n \n \nApplicant has not paid or provided evidence of recent actions she may have taken \nto resolve her federal tax liens. She indicated these liens were filed for unpaid taxes from \n2007 and 2008. The debts are recent and ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant attributed the tax liens to her second husband who did not file their tax \nreturns. She said he was abusive, and she did not have control over the finances. This \nmay have been beyond her control. However, she has been divorced from him since 2008 \nand aware of her tax problems since 2009. She attempted to present Offers in \nCompromise to the IRS, but none were approved. She hired a tax company to help her \nresolve the tax liens, but said it was a scam. She said she has since hired another tax \ncompany to resolve the matter. No substantive documentary evidence was provided to \nshow that she has a current Offer in Compromise with the IRS, or that she has made \npayments to begin resolving the liens. She is credited with making some effort in the past \nto address the tax liens. However, her efforts were sporadic, and there is no current \nevidence to show the debts are being reduced or resolved. AG \u00b6 20(b) has partial \napplication.  \n \n \nThere is no evidence Applicant has received financial counseling and there are not \nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does \nnot apply. Evidence was not provided to show Applicant has an arrangement with the IRS \nto pay the tax liens and is in compliance with it. AG \u00b6 20(g) does not apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \n\n \n6 \n \n \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is 45 years old. She has been aware since 2009 of her tax liens, which \nremain unresolved. Applicant has not met her burden of persuasion. The record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________\nCarol G.

The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \nimplemented on June 8, 2017 (AG). \n \n \nApplicant answered (Ans.) the SOR on February 11, 2019, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. On April 24, 2019, the case was assigned to \nme. On May 23, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified \n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant that the hearing was scheduled for July 23, 2019. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. Government exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. The Government\u2019s exhibit list and request for administrative notice were \nmarked as hearing exhibits (HE) I and II. Applicant testified and offered exhibits (AE) A \nthrough J, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on \nJuly 31, 2019. \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nI took administrative notice of facts concerning Iraq. Department Counsel \nprovided supporting documents that verify, detail, and provide context for the requested \nfacts. The specific facts noticed are included in the Findings of Fact. \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. Usually administrative notice in ISCR proceedings is \naccorded to facts that are either well known or from U.S. Government reports. (See \nISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, \n2004) and McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d \nCir. 1986); Stein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen \ntypes of facts for administrative notice)) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted some of the allegations with \nexplanations, and denied others. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of \nfact. After a thorough and careful review of the evidence, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 54 years old. He was born in Iraq in 1965. He earned two bachelor\u2019s \ndegrees from Iraqi universities. He immigrated to the United States in 2008. He became \na U.S. citizen in 2014. His wife and children are U.S. citizens and residents. (Tr. 22, 29-\n30; GE 1) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s sister, brother, mother-in-law, and father-in-law \nare residents and citizens of Iraq. It also alleged Applicant had an inappropriate \npersonal relationship with foreign military personnel while working in Iraq in December \n2017 and he had inappropriate contact with an Iraqi staff major general with whom he \nserved in the Iraqi Army.  \n \n \nApplicant served as a captain in the Iraqi Army (mandatory) from 1991 until he \ndeserted in 2003 just before the start of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). He deserted \nbecause he did not support the regime and refused to fight for it. After the war started, \nhe volunteered to assist U.S. forces as a linguist. He worked with various units, \nincluding a military police unit at a forward operating base. He was often put in \ndangerous situations. When it became too dangerous for him and his family to remain in \n\n \n3 \n \n \nthe area, he left for Jordan in 2006. In 2008, with the help of a U.S. Army commander \nwho he had worked for, Applicant gained refugee status and immigrated to the United \nStates. In late 2008, he served as a linguist instructor for two months before deploying \nto Iraq in January 2009 working as a contractor linguist for U.S. forces. He remained in \nthat position for over two years until March 2011. He returned to the United States \nbecause of his son\u2019s medical needs. In 2016, he was hired to be a cultural role-player \nfor the Army at one of its training posts. He continued with that position until he was \nhired as a linguist in 2017 for a position in Iraq. He remained in that position until \nJanuary 2019. In this last linguist position, he served for over a year as the primary \nlinguist for the U.S. general (G1) who was the director of an important command \nposition. (23-25, 29-30; AE 1-2) G1 said this about Applicant: \n \n[Applicant] readily accepted dangerous assignments accompanying me to \nthe battlefield on multiple occasions: . . . and multiple other sites where \naccurate communications, physical endurance, and bravery were \nprerequisites. . . . He had a place of trust on [my] staff in Baghdad and it \nfunctioned more smoothly while he was there. (Ans.; AE B) \n \n \nThe successor general (G2) hand-picked Applicant to be his personal linguist. He \nsaid this about Applicant:  \n \n[Applicant] quickly proved to be a trusted advisor, expertly helping me \nnavigate the minute intricacies of Iraq\u2019s military culture. He spent \nnumerous long nights with staff Lieutenant General [A], staff Major \nGeneral [H] and myself providing superb translation as we discussed the \nfuture of Iraqi Security Forces and the combined campaign against the \nIslamic State of Iraq and Syria. (Ans.; AE D)  \n \n \nApplicant denied having any type of inappropriate relationship with any Iraqi \ngeneral or other officer as alleged. Applicant\u2019s denials are partially corroborated by \ninformation provided by G1 and G2. Applicant pointed out that he communicated with \nthe Iraqi generals often, but always at the direction of his U.S. general. He also denied \nany other type of wrongdoing, such as taking unauthorized travel. The source of these \nallegations comes from a U.S. Army counterintelligence memorandum from April 2018. \nThe conclusory memorandum does not state the source of the information. Additionally, \nthe information was not deemed important enough to open an investigation into \nApplicant\u2019s alleged actions. Applicant theorized that the source of the damaging \ncounterintelligence information could have been other disgruntled or jealous linguists. \n(Tr. 33-35; 43; Ans.; GE 3-4; AE B, D)   \n \n \nG1 addressed Applicant\u2019s working relationship with the Iraqi generals and the \nspecter of co-worker jealousy in his letter of support: \n \nHis relationship with me and other superior officers in the [command \ncenter] due to his consistent superior performance caused occasional \njealousy-driven friction in the interpreter pool. Because he earned the trust \n\n \n4 \n \n \nof both the Iraqi officers (he himself is a former officer of the Iraqi Army) \nand senior coalition officers, he had access to both and occasionally \ndelivered messages from one to the other when we were most busy. To a \njealous eye, this practice may have appeared to be an inappropriate \nrelationship. The Iraqi Chief of staff, MG H, would ask [Applicant] to relay \nto me his desire for a meeting, and I would do the same. In similar fashion, \nMG A, my close counterpart and a critical figure in the post precarious \nphases of the Iraqi defeat of ISIS, also trusted [Applicant] to interpret and \nconvey precise, timely, and sensitive communication at the highest \nCoalition/Iraqi government levels. . . . I never witnessed any of the alleged \ntransgressions \u2013 unauthorized travel, misplaced loyalty, or condescending \nbehavior. (AE B) \n \n \nWhen G2 assumed the command position after G1\u2019s departure, he also had an \nopportunity to work with and observe Applicant perform his linguist duties. He described \nhis dealings with Applicant as follows: \n \nThroughout his tenue, I often tasked [Applicant] to converse with \nLieutenant General A and staff Major General H on my behalf. He did so \nwith utmost distinction, adhering strictly to my intent. Never once did he \nfalter in this task, and he always provided timely, succinct responses. I \nhave never doubted [Applicant\u2019s] dedication to the United States, our \ncurrent mission in Iraq, or his profession[alism]. Judging him solely upon \nthe professional that he is, he has earned my utmost trust.  \n \n \nApplicant was wounded twice while performing his duties working for U.S. forces. \nHe owns no property in Iraq. His wife and children live and go to school in the United \nStates. Applicant would put the interests of the United States first regardless of the \ncircumstances. (Tr. 27-28, 35, 48) \n \n \nThe current status of Applicant\u2019s relatives listed in the SOR is as follows: \n \n \n1. Applicant\u2019s brother and sister. Applicant has no ongoing relationship with his \nsiblings who are citizens and reside in Iraq. . He has not spoken to them in over 10 \nyears. He does not know where they reside in Iraq. His estrangement is due to a family \ndispute years ago. (Tr. 31, 47; Ans.) \n \n \n2. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law is \ndeceased. His mother-in-law is a citizen and resident of Iraq. She is in her 70s and \nApplicant does not keep in touch with her. She is unaware of what Applicant does or the \nnature of his work.  (Tr. 32; Ans.)   \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nCharacter Evidence. \n \n \nIn addition to the letters from G1 and G2, Applicant supplied character references \nfrom other military officers, a noncommissioned officer (NCO), and a fellow Iraqi civilian \nlinguist. All described Applicant\u2019s linguistic skills and other positive character traits, such \nas honesty and being a team player, which made him a valuable asset. His abilities \nwere deemed so vital that he was denied his entitled leave during a critical time. G1 \nlater asked that his leave be restored. Several noted that Applicant was disliked by \nsome of his peers whose complaints about him were meritless. Several officers \nrecommended that his clearance be restored. (AE A-J) \n \nAdministrative Notice. \n \n \nThe U.S. State Department warns U.S. citizens against travel to Iraq as travel \nwithin the country remains dangerous. The U.S. Embassy warns that U.S. citizens are at \nhigh risk for kidnapping and violence and to avoid all but essential travel to Iraq. The \nU.S. government considers the potential threat to U.S. government personnel in Iraq to \nbe serious enough to require them to live and work under strict security guidelines. The \nIslamic State of Iraq and Levant (ISIL) remained the greatest terrorist threat globally, \nmaintaining a formidable force in Iraq and Syria. (HE II) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \n\n \n6 \n \n \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d as \nfollows:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and  \n(d) counterintelligence information, whether classified or unclassified, that \nindicates the individual's access to classified information or eligibility for a \nsensitive position may involve unacceptable risk to national security. \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment, a family member or friend is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, the country is known to conduct intelligence collection operations against \nthe United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism. The \nrelationship between Iraq and the United States places a significant, but not \ninsurmountable burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationships \nwith his relatives and friends living in Iraq does not pose a security risk. Applicant \nshould not be placed in a position where he might be forced to choose between loyalty \nto the United States and a desire to assist his relatives and friends living in Iraq who \nmight be coerced by governmental entities, or pressured to assist Iraq.  \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004)) \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States \nover matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, \nwe know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. \n \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives from Iraq seek or have \nsought classified or economic information from or through Applicant or his relatives \nliving in Iraq, it is not possible to rule out such a possibility in the future. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and \n7(b) apply based upon Applicant\u2019s family members who are residents and citizens of \nIraq. The counterintelligence letter alleging possible improprieties by Applicant raises \nthe issue of unacceptable risk. AG \u00b6 7(d) applies. \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns, \nincluding:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \n\n \n8 \n \n \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.;  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and     \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee. \nApplicant credibly testified that he has no contact with his Iraqi siblings and \nlimited contact with his Iraqi mother-in-law. He presented sufficient evidence to establish \nthat it is unlikely that he would be placed in a position to choose between the interest of \nhis relatives living in Iraq and those of the United States. He already has demonstrated \nthat he would put the United States\u2019 interests first when he worked as a linguist for U.S. \nforces on three different occasions. AG \u00b6 8(a) applies. \n \nApplicant has met his burden to establish his \u201cdeep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d He became a U.S. citizen in 2014. He currently \nworks and lives in the United States with his wife and two children. He worked as a \nlinguist in Iraq from 2003 to 2006, from 2009 to 2011, and from 2017 to 2019. He \nperformed different missions for U.S. forces where he earned praise for his service \nwhile in harm\u2019s way. He was twice injured performing his duties. He performed his \nlinguistic duties for U.S. general officers. The evidence supports that Applicant has \nlongstanding ties to the United States and would resolve any conflict of interest in favor \nof the United States. AG \u00b6 8(b) applies.  \n \nThe allegations concerning Applicant\u2019s possible inappropriate relationship with \nIraqi senior officers were rebutted by Applicant\u2019s evidence explaining the nature of his \nduties and corroborated by U.S. personnel that ordered Applicant to directly \ncommunicate with high-level Iraqi officers. Evidence also supports that the allegations \nmay have been leveled by persons with bad motives arising from personal jealousy of \nApplicant. AG \u00b6 8(d) applies. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The circumstances tending to \nsupport granting Applicant\u2019s clearance are more significant than the factors weighing \ntowards denying his clearance. I considered the comments by Applicant\u2019s U.S. military \nsupervisors, who attested to his dedication and commitment to U.S. forces. I also \nconsidered his strong ties to this country as a linguist serving in harm\u2019s way while \nassisting U.S forces. He has demonstrated his longstanding loyalty to the United States. \nTherefore, he provided sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns.  \n \nOverall the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude that the security concerns arising under Guideline B, foreign influence, were \nmitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs     1.a: - 1.e: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nRobert E.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 39 years old. He received an associate\u2019s degree in 2013 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2016. He expects to receive a master\u2019s degree in business administration in December 2020. He was married to his first wife from 2006 until they divorced in 2008. Applicant married his second wife in 2010, and she has an adult daughter. He has two minor children with women with whom he was not married. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from 2010 until 2014 when he was medically retired and received an honorable discharge. Applicant currently works for his brother\u2019s truck company and as a carpenter. (GE 1; GE 2 at 5-6; AE N; AE U; Tr. 11-15, 27, 52-55) While Applicant was serving on active duty in the U.S. Army, he injured his back and refused to make airborne jumps. His command believed he was malingering, and as a result, he received nonjudicial punishment three times, was reduced in rank from an E- 4 to an E-1, and experienced the subsequent pay losses. Applicant\u2019s interim secret security clearance was also denied in 2013 due to his financial issues. Most of the debts alleged in the SOR became delinquent while he was on active duty. (GE 2 at 9; GE 5; AE DD; Tr. 14-16, 25-27, 44, 46-49, 51-52, 56-57) As noted above, Applicant was medically retired from the U.S. Army in 2014, and was not in fact malingering. (Tr. 14-16, 25-27, 44, 46-49, 51-52, 56-57) He was originally granted an 80% disability rating from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), but in May",

The Government was ready to proceed on February 21, 2019, and \nthe case was assigned to me on March 11, 2019. On April 3, 2019, I issued an order to \nboth parties to produce their evidence by April 29, 2019. On April 8, 2019, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled \nfor May 15, 2019.

He timely submitted AE P through\nAE EE, which I admitted without objection, and the record is closed. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n2 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 39 years old. He received an associate\u2019s degree in 2013 and a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2016. He expects to receive a master\u2019s degree in business \nadministration in December 2020. He was married to his first wife from 2006 until they \ndivorced in 2008. Applicant married his second wife in 2010, and she has an adult \ndaughter. He has two minor children with women with whom he was not married. He \nserved on active duty in the U.S. Army from 2010 until 2014 when he was medically retired \nand received an honorable discharge. Applicant currently works for his brother\u2019s truck \ncompany and as a carpenter. (GE 1; GE 2 at 5-6; AE N; AE U; Tr. 11-15, 27, 52-55) \n \nWhile Applicant was serving on active duty in the U.S. Army, he injured his back \nand refused to make airborne jumps. His command believed he was malingering, and as \na result, he received nonjudicial punishment three times, was reduced in rank from an E-\n4 to an E-1, and experienced the subsequent pay losses. Applicant\u2019s interim secret \nsecurity clearance was also denied in 2013 due to his financial issues. Most of the debts \nalleged in the SOR became delinquent while he was on active duty. (GE 2 at 9; GE 5; AE \nDD; Tr. 14-16, 25-27, 44, 46-49, 51-52, 56-57) \n \nAs noted above, Applicant was medically retired from the U.S. Army in 2014, and \nwas not in fact malingering. (Tr. 14-16, 25-27, 44, 46-49, 51-52, 56-57) He was originally \ngranted an 80% disability rating from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), but in May \n2018, his rating was reduced to 50%. Applicant appealed this change and was recently \nawarded a 100% disability rating. (Tr. 14-16, 25-27, 44, 46-49, 51-52, 56-57) \n \nAfter he was discharged from the U.S. Army in 2014, Applicant had a difficult time \nfinding gainful employment, which negatively impacted his finances. He chose to go back \nto school due to these issues. (GE 2 at 4; Tr. 28)  \n \nApplicant and his current wife have been living separately since approximately \nDecember 2016. He still provides his wife some financial support, but he has been living \nwith his mother. At the hearing, he testified that he financially supported his wife\u2019s family \nwhile he served on active duty which contributed to his financial issues. He also believes \nhis wife and her sister have opened accounts in his name without his consent and \nknowledge. As a result, Applicant uses a company to monitor his credit history. (GE 1 at \n6; Tr. 27-32, 72-73, 80-82) In March 2019, Applicant was in a car accident, which has \nnegatively impacted his finances this year. (AE V; AE W; AE X; AE Y; AE Z; AE AA; AE \nCC; Tr. 84, 90-91, 95-96) \n \nStarting in 2016, Applicant has attended extensive credit counseling to resolve his \ndebts, and he continues to attend classes. In conjunction with these classes, Applicant \nhas made considerable and diligent efforts to resolve his delinquent debts and to improve \nhis finances. (Tr. 37-42, 78-79) \n \n \nApplicant did not sign the purchase agreement for the vehicle loan alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.a. With the assistance of an Army attorney, Applicant disputed this debt while he was \non active duty, and it was removed from his credit report. (GE 2 at 16; Tr. 58-65) \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant used the loan alleged SOR \u00b6 1.b to purchase a vehicle for his wife in \nMay 2016. She failed to make the payments as she promised, which is one of the reasons \nwhy they separated in December 2016. Applicant testified that he has been in contact \nwith the lender and intends to settle the debt. (GE 2 at 12; GE 3 at 2; Tr. 65-67, 89) \n \n \nApplicant paid, settled, and resolved the following SOR allegations: \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, \n1.g, 1.h, 1.j, 1.l, 1.n, 1.p, 1.r, 1.s. He paid and resolved most of these debts before the \nSOR was issued. (GE 2 at 10-13, 16; AE A; AE B; AE C; AE D; AE E; AE F; AE G; AE H; \nAE I; AE J; AE P; AE R; AE S; AE BB; AE EE; Tr. 67-71, 74-80, 83, 86) \n \n \nApplicant disputed the following SOR allegations, as they are not his debts: \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, \n1.i, 1.k, 1.m, and they have been removed from his most recent CBR. (GE 2 at 10, 15-16; \nTr. 40, 71-73, 77-80; AE Q; AE EE) \n \n \n SOR \u00b6 1.e is an open account, and it is current. (Tr. 43, 71; AE O at 8; AE EE at \n10) \n \n \nApplicant has attempted to settle SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o and 1.q, but these accounts and \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.t, 1.u, are outside of the statute of limitations and negotiations have been \ndifficult. (GE 2 at 12-13; AE O; AE EE; Tr. 83-89) \n \nApplicant\u2019s current finances are in good standing, and his state and federal taxes \nare current. His $350 and $250 monthly child support payments are current, and he \nfollows a written budget. (Tr. 33, 43, 50, 55-56, 90-92) \n \nApplicant received the following awards and decorations related to his military \nservice: Army Good Conduct Medal; National Defense Service Medal; Global War on \nTerrorism Service Medal; and Army Service Ribbon. Applicant also provided several \nletters of recommendation recognizing that he is responsible, reliable, and trustworthy. \n(AE L; AE T; Tr. 24, 49) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \n\n \n4 \n \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence establish two disqualifying \nconditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant experienced personal financial issues related to his Army service, \nseparation from his wife, and difficulty in finding gainful employment. In 2016, two years \nbefore the SOR was issued, he started working with credit counselors to address his \ndelinquent debts, and he has consistently and diligently worked to address his financial \nobligations. His efforts demonstrate a good-faith effort to resolve his debts, and the record \nevidence demonstrates that the debts are either resolved or under control. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nApplicant follows a written budget and pays his current financial obligations. He is \nwilling and able to live within his means, which is reflected in the testimonial and \ndocumentary evidence. Mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) are  \nestablished.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. \n \nI conclude Applicant met his burden of proof and persuasion. He mitigated the \nfinancial considerations security concerns and established his eligibility for a security \nclearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.u:  \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n7 \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security of the \nUnited States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n__________________________ \nCAROLINE E. HEINTZELMAN \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns. \nThe disqualifying condition that is relevant to Applicant\u2019s case is: \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \nApplicant has a history of failing to file his federal and state income tax returns.  \nAt the close of the record, he still had not filed his federal income tax return for 2016 \nand his state income tax return for 2014 and 2016. AG \u00b6 19(f) applies to Applicant\u2019s \ncase.  \n  \n \nAn individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or careless in his obligations to protect classified information. Behaving \nirresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in \nother aspects of life. A person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until \nevidence is uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to pay debts under \nagreed terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations.  \n \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information.  See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \n\n \n5 \n \n \nhis or her legal obligations, such as paying taxes when due, does not demonstrate the \nhigh degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to \nclassified information. See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018). \n \nWith regard to Applicant\u2019s federal tax debts, the emphasis of the DOHA Appeal \nBoard on security concerns arising from tax cases is instructive. See ISCR Case No. \n14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance and stating, \n\u201cHis delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action \nonly after his security clearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that \nApplicant has rehabilitated himself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of \nrules and regulations expected of someone entrusted with the nation\u2019s secrets.\u201d); ISCR \nCase No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (reversing grant of a security \nclearance and emphasizing the applicant\u2019s failure to timely file and pay taxes); See also \nISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (reversing grant of a security \nclearance, and stating \u201cA security clearance represents an obligation to the Federal \nGovernment for the protection of national secrets. Accordingly failure to honor other \nobligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201d)  \n \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005))  \n \nAG \u00b6 20 includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n (d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s tax issues remain unresolved for \nthe 2014 and 2016 tax years. The status of Applicant\u2019s federal tax return for tax year \n2016 and his state tax returns for tax years 2014 and 2016 remain uncertain.   \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies because Applicant\u2019s financial situation was adversely \naffected by his period of unemployment/underemployment from late 2013 to September \n2015. However, he has been employed full-time since September 2015.  Applicant had \nseveral years to file his 2014 and 2016 state income tax returns and his 2016 federal \nincome tax return. I cannot conclude that he acted responsibly under the circumstances.  \nFor this reason AG \u00b6 20(b) is given less weight.      \n \n \n \nAG & 20(d) applies pertaining to Applicant\u2019s 2014, 2015 and 2017 federal income \ntax returns alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b.  Although, he filed his returns late, he filed them within \na reasonable time period. He did not owe any income taxes for those years.  He made a \ngood-faith effort regarding those tax returns. Unfortunately, he did not actively pursue \nfiling his 2014 and 2016 state income tax returns and his 2016 federal income tax \nreturn. As a result, a question remains because of Applicant\u2019s negligence in filing his \noutstanding state and federal tax returns.  \n \nAG & 20(g) applies in that Applicant has filed all of his federal tax returns for tax \nyears 2014, 2015 and 2017. SOR \u00b6 1.b is found for Applicant. However, at the close of \nthe record, Applicant provided no proof that he filed his 2016 federal income tax return \nor his 2014 and 2016 state income tax returns. Failure to timely file all of his state and \nfederal income tax returns raises questions about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nand ability to protect classified information.     \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n       I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s favorable \nemployment history as a federal contractor. I considered the adverse affect Applicant\u2019s \nperiod of under-employment between late 2013 to September 2015 had on his finances.  \nWhile Applicant filed several of his late income tax returns, several of his state and \nfederal income tax returns remain unfiled.  As a U.S. citizen, Applicant had a duty to be \nproactive in timely filing his federal and state income returns. At the close of the record, \nhe provided no proof that he filed his 2016 federal income tax return or his 2014 and \n2016 state income tax returns. Security concerns under financial considerations are not \nmitigated.    \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b   \n \n \n \nFor Applicant   \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn July 12, 2017, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an \nElectronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security \nClearance Application. On January 9, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \nand modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG), for all covered \nindividuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or \neligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIn a sworn statement, dated February 11, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR \nand elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete \ncopy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on March 7, 2019, and he was afforded \nan opportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a \ncopy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. \nApplicant received the FORM on March 13, 2019. Applicant responded to the FORM by \ntimely submitting a statement and associated documents, all of which were accepted \nwithout objection. The case was assigned to me on April 26, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, both of the factual \nallegations pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b.). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration \nof same, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a manufacturing engineer with his current employer since May 2015. He previously \nheld a position as an entry level process engineer, although he erroneously described his \ntitle in his e-QIP as a senior process engineer, with another federal contractor from \nSeptember 2011 until May 2015. Applicant received a bachelor\u2019s degree in August 2011. \nHe has never served with the U.S. military.  He has never held a security clearance. \nApplicant was married in February 2017. He has no children.  \n \nFinancial Considerations1 \nApplicant was a full-time student at a university from June 2006 until August 2008, \nand from August 2008 until May 2011, he was both a student and a part-time employee \nof the university athletic department.

The deferment period on repayment of the \nstudent loans expired. Applicant claimed that he called his student-loan lenders, and while \nhis federal lenders were able to reduce his monthly payments on the front end, by adding \nincreased payments eventually when he was expected to be making a better income, the \nbank lender for the other student loans offered him no relief except by telling him to \u201cpay \nit as he could.\u201d With insufficient funds to address all of his financial obligations, Applicant \nmade a decision to pay his federal student loans and an automobile loan, and not address \nthe private lenders. Those loans went into a default status.3 \nOnce Applicant was making a salary sufficient for him to start addressing his \ndefaulted student loans, they had been placed for collection; charged off; sold to other \ncollection agents or debt purchasers; and the statute of limitations had expired. There is \nno evidence to indicate that the lender issued Applicant a Form 1099-C, Cancellation of \nDebt, to forgive the debt. Applicant stated that he might have been more willing to resolve \nthe loans had his grandmother still been alive so his delinquency would not impact her \nfinancially, but she was now deceased.4 In his e-QIP, Applicant stated:5  \nIt has been too long that they cannot come after me in a legal matter to pay \nback the debt and also has been sold to a secondary company so it is no \nlonger considered a legal debt that I owe other than for my credit score. I \nhave the money in savings so I could pay off the remaining debt but have \nlived with the credit hit this long that I have decided to let this pass without \npaying the debt collectors. \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated: \u201cI am not proud of the fact that I have \nunpaid debts, but I believe I made the best choice for my future at the time. Once the \nprivate loans were charged off, they hold a statute of limitations for legal action that has \nsince expired.\u201d6 He added: If I need to pay off the debt in order to move forward with the \nclearance process, I am willing and able to do that.\u201d7 \nAlthough Applicant claims to have approximately $80,000 in private stock and \nmutual fund assets as well as approximately $100,000 in real property equity, he claimed \nthat those funds were either his wife\u2019s or generated by his wife\u2019s inheritance. Applicant \nstated that the \u201cmoney is available if there was ever a financial hardship and could be \n                                                          \n2 Item 3, supra note 1, at 14-15; Item 4, supra note 1, at 4. \n \n3 Item 3, supra note 1, at 14-15; Item 4, supra note 1, at 4; Item 1, supra note 1. \n \n4 Item 4, supra note 1, at 4. \n \n5 Item 3, supra note 1, at 36. \n \n6 Item 1, supra note 1. \n \n7 Item 1, supra note 1. \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nused to pay a bill or some other item.\u201d8 He offered no documentation to support his \ncontention as to the source of his available financial assets. \nThe SOR alleges only two delinquent accounts, the two student loans referred to \nabove. One was charged off in July 2012, in the amount of $17,459, and the other was \ncharged off in July 2012, in the amount of $17,224.  \nIt is not known what Applicant\u2019s current financial resources may be because he did \nnot report his current net monthly income; monthly expenses; and any monthly remainder \nthat might be available for discretionary spending or savings. However, according to the \ncredit reporting agencies, as of March 2019, he had credit scores of between 800 and \n814, evidence of excellent credit.9 There is no evidence of financial counseling or a \nbudget. Nevertheless, in the absence of additional delinquent debts, it appears that \nApplicant is currently in a significantly better position financially than he had been several \nyears ago.  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d10 As Commander in Chief, the President has \nthe authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to \ndetermine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to \ngrant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d11   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \n                                                          \n8 Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM, supra note 1, at 1. \n \n9 Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM, supra note 1, at 2; Credit Scores, various dates, attached to \nApplicant\u2019s Response to the FORM. \n \n10 Department of the Navy v.

Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nhas the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation \nor mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.13  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d14  \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d15 Thus, nothing in this \ndecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in \npart, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines \nthe President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, \nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n \n \n                                                          \n12 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 \nat 2 (App. Bd.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nWhile Applicant may have had financial difficulties when he was a recent graduate \nfrom college and a newly employed worker due to insufficient funds to maintain all of his \naccounts in a current status, time and improved finances eventually resulted in his \nresolution of most of his delinquent debts. His present situation is not caused by any \ninability to satisfy his remaining debts, but rather by his refusal to do so. Applicant has \ntwo delinquent student-loan accounts, totaling approximately $35,000, placed for \ncollection, and charged off in 2012. Although Applicant has sufficient funds to at least \nstart resolving those debts, because they were charged off, sold to other collection agents \nor debt purchasers, and the statute of limitations had expired, he contends he is no longer \nresponsible for them, and he has no intention to pay them off.16 He has not addressed \n                                                          \n16 Applicant\u2019s credit reports indicate that his two debts are in charged-off status. Eventually the \ncharged-off debts will be dropped from his credit report. \u201c[T]hat some debts have dropped off his credit \nreport is not meaningful evidence of debt resolution.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires \nremoval of most negative financial items from a credit report seven years from the first date of delinquency \nor the debt becoming collection barred because of a state statute of limitations, whichever is longer.

Sept. 13, 2016)). \n \n18 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some \nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not \ndefine the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must do more than \nmerely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy [or \nstatute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. The nature, frequency, and recency of \nApplicant\u2019s continuing financial difficulties, or refusal to resolve his delinquent student \nloans, although he has had the financial ability to do so for several years, make it rather \neasy to conclude that it was not infrequent and it is likely to remain unchanged, much like \nit has been for the past seven years. While the debts may have originally become \ndelinquent when Applicant was unable to continue making timely payments, his financial \ncircumstances eventually improved significantly, and at that point he should have started \naddressing them with the eventual goal of resolving them. Applicant preferred to address \nother debts, which is an acceptable factor, but in doing so, he clearly and unequivocally \ndeclared that he had no intention to make any efforts to resolve these two student loans, \noffering a variety of justifications for his inactions. Inaction or refusal to take timely and \nappropriate action with respect to student loans indicates irresponsibility toward financial \nand social obligations in general. When an individual with otherwise good credit, such as \nApplicant, fails to make student loan payments, his actions can be interpreted as a lack \nof respect for financial obligations. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient.  \n \nIn this instance, to date, there is substantial evidence that no good-faith corrective \nactions have been taken by Applicant, either after he completed his e-QIP in July 2017, \nafter his interview in August 2018, or after he received the FORM in March 2019. There \nis circumstantial evidence to conclude that, with the exception of these two delinquent \nstudent-loan debts, Applicant\u2019s finances are under control, and there is direct evidence \nthat he has sufficient assets to at least commence making some good-faith efforts to \nresolve those debts. Applicant\u2019s actions, or inaction, under the circumstances cast doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.19 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n                                                          \n19 See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \n \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.20   \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s finances and conduct. \nApplicant. He is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor, serving as a \nmanufacturing engineer with his current employer since May 2015. He previously held a \nposition as an entry level process engineer with another federal contractor from \nSeptember 2011 until May 2015. Although he financially struggled upon receiving his \nbachelor\u2019s degree, and for some time while working with his first employer, time and \nimproved finances enabled him to eventually resolve most of his old delinquent debts, \namass a significant amount of financial assets, and achieve credit scores of 800 and \nabove.  \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. His present situation is not caused by any inability to satisfy his remaining \ndebts, but rather by his refusal to do so. Applicant has two delinquent student-loan \naccounts, totaling approximately $35,000, placed for collection, and charged off in 2012. \nAlthough he has sufficient funds to at least start resolving those debts, because they were \ncharged off, sold to other collection agents or debt purchasers, and the statute of \nlimitations had expired, he contends he is no longer responsible for them, and he has \nrepeatedly stated that he has no intention to pay them off. He has not addressed either \ndebt since 2012. Now finally concerned about a security clearance, Applicant recently \nstated that if he needed to resolve the debts in order to obtain his security clearance, he \nwould be willing and able to do so. While seemingly willing, to date, Applicant has not \ndone so. It is not known what Applicant\u2019s current financial resources may be, but, in the \nabsence of additional delinquent debts, it appears that he is currently in a significantly \nbetter position financially than he had been. His financial situation seems to be under \ncontrol.  \n                                                          \n20 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-\n3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating:21 \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nWhile Applicant previously demonstrated a good track record of debt reduction and \nelimination efforts, resolving his earlier non-SOR debts years ago, since improving his \nfinancial situation to the point where his credit scores are now 800 and above, Applicant \nhas repeatedly refused to make any good-faith efforts to resolve his two delinquent \nstudent loans, totaling approximately $35,000. His current track record is poor. Overall, \nthe evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has \nfailed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. See \nSEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n                                                          \n21 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd.

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on January 6, 2017. On \nJanuary 9, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline B. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 1, 2019, and requested a decision on \nthe written record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s \n\n \n2 \n \nwritten case on March 11, 2019. On April 5, 2019, a complete copy of the file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM), consisting of Items 1 through 5, was sent to Applicant, who was given \nan opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence. She received the FORM on April 10, 2019, and did not \nrespond. The case was assigned to me on June 5, 2019.  \n \n \nFORM Item 4 is a summary of an interview with Applicant conducted by a \nsecurity investigator on March 30, 2017. The summary was not authenticated as \nrequired by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. Department Counsel informed Applicant that she was \nentitled to comment on the accuracy of the summary; make any corrections, additions, \ndeletions or updates; or object to consideration of the summary on the ground that it \nwas not authenticated. I conclude that she waived any objections to the interview \nsummary by failing to respond to the FORM. \u201cAlthough pro se applicants are not \nexpected to act like lawyers, they are expected to take timely and reasonable steps to \nprotect their rights under the Directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12-10810 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, \n2016). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted all the allegations. Her \nadmissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old research programmer employed by a defense \ncontractor since November 2016. She was employed in the private sector from August \n2002 to October 2011. She was laid off and unemployed from November 2011 to \nOctober 2016. She has never held a security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant was born in Russia. She came to the United States in November 1998. \nShe attended a U.S. university from September 2000 to May 2002 and received a \nbachelor\u2019s degree. She married a native of Russia in June 2005. She became a U.S. \ncitizen in April 2006. Her husband is a dual U.S.-Russian citizen, employed as an \ninformation technology manager in the U.S. entertainment industry. (FORM Item 4 at 5.) \nShe and her husband have two children, who were born in the United States in March \n2008 and February 2014 and are dual U.S.-Russian citizens.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents and sister are citizens and residents of Russia. Applicant \nmaintains dual U.S.-Russian citizenship so that she can visit her parents and sister in \nRussia without obtaining a visa. (FORM Item 4 at 1.) Applicant visited her family in \nRussian for 6-10 days in 2008; 21-30 days in 2009, 2010, and 2011; and more than 30 \ndays in 2012, 2014, and 2015. (FORM Item 4 at 31-39.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are both employed by a Russian building-material company. \nHer mother is a manager for the company and her father is a director. Her sister is a \nRussian lawyer. Applicant has daily electronic contact with her mother, weekly \nelectronic contact with her father, and weekly electronic contact with her sister. (FORM \nItem 4 at 5-6.) \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law are dual U.S.-Russian citizens and \nlive in the United States. Her father-in-law previously worked as a scientist for a Russian \nclean-water company. Her mother-in-law has not previously worked outside the home, \nexcept for work as a German translator. (FORM Item 4 at 6.) There is no evidence that \nApplicant\u2019s husband has any immediate family members or other persons with whom he \nhas ties of obligation or affection in Russia. \n \n \n \nAs requested by Department Counsel, I have taken administrative notice that \nRussia is one of the top three most aggressive collectors of economic information and \ntechnological intelligence from U.S. sources. Russia uses cyber operations as an \ninstrument of intelligence collection, using sophisticated and large-scale hacking to \ncollect sensitive information, influence the political process in the United States, and \nundermine Euro-Atlantic unity. Russian also uses commercial and academic enterprises \nthat interact with the West, recruitment of Russian immigrants with advanced technical \nskills, and penetration of public and private enterprises by Russian intelligence agents \nto obtain sensitive technical information. The areas of highest interest include \nalternative energy, biotechnology, defense technology, environmental protection, high-\nend manufacturing, and information and communications technology. Russian agents \nhave been involved in intrusions affecting U.S. citizens, corporate entities, international \norganizations, and political organizations in the United States. Significant human-rights \nissues in Russia include extrajudicial killings; enforced disappearance; torture, including \npunitive psychiatric incarceration; harsh prison conditions; arbitrary arrest and detention; \nand lack of judicial independence. The Department of State has identified Moscow as a \nhigh-threat location for terrorist activity directed at official U.S. Government interests. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \n\n \n4 \n \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s father, mother, and sister are citizens and \nresidents of Russia (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c). The security concern under this guideline is set \nout in AG \u00b6 6:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual maybe manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \n\n \n5 \n \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \nand \n \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's \nobligation to protect classified or sensitive information or technology and \nthe individual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information or technology. \n \nThe totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well as each \nindividual family tie must be considered. ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. \n22, 2003). Applicants with foreign family ties to a country that is hostile to the United \nStates have a heavy burden of persuasion to show that neither they nor their family \nmembers are subject to influence by that country. ISCR Case No. 11-01888 (App. Bd. \nJun. 1, 2012), citing ISCR Case No. 07-00029 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2007). \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened \nrisk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low standard. \n\u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \nmember living under a foreign government. Russia\u2019s aggressive intelligence efforts \ntargeting U.S. industry, technology, and political processes; its poor human rights \nrecord; and terrorist activity within Russia aimed at U.S. interests are sufficient to \nestablish a heightened risk under AG \u00b6 7(a) and create the potential conflict of interest \ncontemplated in AG \u00b6 7(b). \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n\n \n6 \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, \nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interest; \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n \nNone of the above mitigating conditions are established. Applicant has lived in \nthe United States for half of her adult life. She, her husband, and her children are \ncitizens and residents of the United States. Her professional life and her husband\u2019s \nprofessional life are in the United States. On the other hand, she has deep and \nlongstanding ties to Russia. All her immediate family members are citizens and \nresidents of Russia, and she maintains frequent contact with them. She has retained \nher Russian citizenship to facilitate her frequent contact with family members. She has \nnot rebutted the presumption that contacts with an immediate family member in a \nforeign country are not casual. See ISCR Case No. 00-0484 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, \n2002).  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should apply the nine adjudicative factors in AG \n\u00b6 2(d): (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and \nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the \nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline B in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested \na determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate her \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline B and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by her family ties to \nRussia. \n\n \n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B (Foreign Influence):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

National security eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 11, 2017, Applicant completed and signed his security clearance \napplication (SCA). On March 8, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was \ntaken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDOD on June 8, 2017.    \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 28, 2019, and requested an administrative \ndecision based on the written record. He denied all of the SOR allegations, and he \nattached two receipts showing two accounts, alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.w and 1.x, were paid \n\n \n2 \n \nin full, and student loan documentation. On April 18, 2019, DOHA Department Counsel \nsubmitted the File of Relevant Material (FORM). After the receipt of the FORM, Applicant \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. On August 30, 2019, the case was \nassigned to me. On August 30, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for September 16, 2019. The \nhearing was held as scheduled. \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 4; Applicant testified and offered five documents, Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough E into evidence. I admitted all proffered exhibits into evidence without objection. \nI held the record open for 30 days in the event either party wanted to submit additional \ndocumentation. Applicant timely submitted AE F and G, which I entered into evidence \nwithout objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 30, 2019, \nand the record closed on October 16, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 39 years old. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2012, and claimed \nhe was 20 hours shy of earning a bachelor\u2019s degree. He married in 2009, and has three \nchildren; a one-year-old son, and two daughters, ages four and seven. Applicant enlisted \nin the Air National Guard (ANG) in 2006, and he received an honorable discharge in \nDecember 2014. He is working as a cybersecurity analyst for a DOD contractor where he \nhas worked since 2017. His annual salary is $77,810, and his wife earns about $16,000 \nannually as a part-time paralegal. Applicant has held a DOD security clearance since \n2007. (Tr. 7, 28, 32, 34-39, 54-, GE 1; AE C, AE E)  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 22 delinquent student loans totaling $60,649, and other two \nunpaid accounts totaling $651. In 2010, Applicant enrolled into a technical college and \naccumulated significant student loan debt. He was unable to pay on his student loans \nwith a growing family and limited income. His employer pays for his medical insurance, \nbut Applicant is fully responsible for his family\u2019s medical insurance, which costs \napproximately $13,000 annually. In 2019, Applicant and his wife joined a financial \ncounseling course through their church. He has been reading the Dave Ramsey book \nand learning how to get out of debt, and how he can prepare a college savings plan for \ntheir three children.  As recommended by the financial course, Applicant and his wife do \nnot possess any credit cards. They pay cash, or use their debit card, for all of their \nexpenses. Applicant and his wife have also learned how they can reduce their expenses \nand follow a budget. (Tr. 36-38, 43-47, 62, 64-67; GE 1) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.v allege delinquent student-loan accounts totaling $60,649, \nwhich were referred for collection. Applicant\u2019s 2017 Federal tax refund of approximately \n$3,400 was intercepted in 2018 and applied to his delinquent student loans. In 2018 \nApplicant entered into a student loan rehabilitation program with the collection company. \nHe started making $50 monthly payments, and then he increased his monthly payments \nto $121. In April 2019, Applicant\u2019s Federal tax refund of $6,228 was intercepted and \napplied to his delinquent student loans. Applicant claimed that at the time his 2018 tax \nrefund was intercepted, he had already completed the student loan rehabilitation program \n\n \n3 \n \nand his student loans were no longer in default. In June 2019, the collection company \nreferred his student loans to a different creditor. During the transfer process, the new \ncreditor required him to make $5 payments for the months of June and July 2019. (Tr. 21- \n25, 47-54, 59; SOR response) \n \n \nThe new creditor determined that Applicant was to pay $695 every month for his \nrehabilitated student loans. Applicant testified that he could not afford this amount, and \nasked to be evaluated for an income-driven repayment plan. The new creditor was \nprovided with his tax returns and monthly expenses in order to initiate a new monthly \npayment schedule. A few days before his August monthly student loan payment was due, \nApplicant was involved in an auto accident. He requested and received forbearance on \nhis student loan payments until October 2019. At the hearing, he provided documentation \nthat his current student loan balance was $58,920. Applicant also stated that by the end \nof the week he expected to receive documentation from the creditor with the new monthly \npayment schedule. Applicant timely submitted AE F after the hearing, which showed his \nstudent loans were in good standing and beginning November 13, 2019, his monthly \npayments will be approximately $259. Applicant\u2019s student loans are in good standing and \nhe took responsible action with the creditor to obtain an affordable payment plan, as \nsupported by his monthly budget. (Tr. 21-25, 47-54, 59; AE F, AE G) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.w alleges an unpaid medical account for $337. Applicant believed the \nmilitary was responsible for paying this expense. He provided documentation with his \nSOR response that he paid this debt in full in March 2019. This delinquent medical \naccount is fully resolved. (Tr. 45-46; SOR response) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.x alleges a delinquent cable utility account for $314. Applicant provided \ndocumentation with his SOR response that he paid this debt in full in March 2019. This \ndelinquent cable utility account is fully resolved. (Tr. 46; SOR response) \n \n \nApplicant provided a character-reference letter and his current employee \nperformance appraisal at the hearing. A former supervisor and captain in the ANG \nreported that Applicant was vital in the success of their unit, and he is reliable and \ntrustworthy. In addition, Applicant\u2019s supervisor reported during the most recent appraisal \nperiod that Applicant \u201cis by far one of the top performing analysts.\u201d (AE D, AE E) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \n\n \n4 \n \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \n\n \n5 \n \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n  \n AG \u00b6 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d The evidence of record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and \n19(c). Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is required. \n \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances suffered due to limited income and a growing family, as well \nas the unanticipated expense of maintaining medical insurance for his family. Applicant\u2019s \ninability to pay his significant delinquent student loans in a timely manner caused them to \ngo into default. In 2018, Applicant acted responsibly when he entered into a student loan \nrehabilitation program and successfully had his student loans taken out of default status. \nIn 2019, he and his wife started financial counseling. They are committed to resolving \ntheir financial issues and start saving for their children\u2019s college education. For the past \ntwo years, Applicant has made significant progress with his student loan debt. He is \napplying information he learned from his financial counseling classes to reduce \nunnecessary expenses and maintain a responsible budget. At this time, he does not have \nany delinquent accounts. Under the current circumstances, there are clear indications \nthat his finances are under control. He documented that two small debts were paid. \n\n \n6 \n \nFinancial considerations security concerns are mitigated. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (b), (c) and (d) \napply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F and the AG \u00b6 2(d) factors in this \nwhole-person analysis.  \n \n \nThe Federal government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in persons granted access to classified information. In deciding whether to \ngrant or continue access to classified information, the Federal government can take into \naccount facts and circumstances of an applicant's personal life that shed light on the \nperson's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Furthermore, security clearance \ndecisions are not limited to consideration of an applicant's conduct during work or duty \nhours. Even if an applicant has a good work record, his off-duty conduct or circumstances \ncan have security significance and may be considered in evaluating the applicant's \nnational security eligibility.  \n \n \nApplicant has made positive changes managing his finances, and he currently has \nno delinquent debt or defaulted student loans. He is committed to remaining debt-free, \nand he is applying information he has gained from financial counseling to his lifestyle. I \nfind future financial problems are unlikely to recur. After evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concerns.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.x: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact1 Applicant is a 48-year-old systems analyst for a defense contractor, where he has worked since 2012. He obtained his undergraduate degree in December 1999. He has held a security clearance for approximately 19 years. He is divorced and has two children. His young daughter has multiple, severe health issues. (GX 1, Tr. 12, Tr. 60) Applicant disclosed the misdemeanor on his security clearance application. (GX 1) He acknowledged that he was sentenced to six months of probation which ended in December 2016. He was arrested during a prostitution sting for solicitation and possession of criminal tools on May 2, 2016. He entered a plea agreement at the advice of his attorney.

Nussbaum, Esq. \n \n11/22/2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines) F (Financial \nConsiderations) and E (Personal Conduct). Eligibility for access to classified information \nis granted. \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on June 15, 2016. On January \n9, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent \nhim a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guidelines F and E. \nThe DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on \nJune 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 29, 2019. On July 23, 2019, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled \nfor October 10, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \nthrough 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified, presented two \n\n2 \n \ntelephonic witnesses and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A, which was admitted \nwithout objection. At Applicant\u2019s request, I kept the record open for additional \nsubmissions. Applicant submitted AX B in a timely manner. The exhibit was entered into \nthe record without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on October 17, 2019. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nThe Government moved to amend the SOR by withdrawing all of the allegations \nunder Guideline F, and to withdraw Guideline E, \u00b6 2.a. The motion was granted without \nobjection. The amended SOR that remained was SOR \u00b6 2.b: \u201cOn or about May 2, 2016, \nwhile holding a security clearance, you were arrested during a prostitution sting operation \nand charged with soliciting and possessing criminal tools. You pleaded guilty to loitering \nto engage in solicitation.\u201d Applicant admitted the allegation in his answer and provided a \ndetailed explanation. \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old systems analyst for a defense contractor, where he has \nworked since 2012. He obtained his undergraduate degree in December 1999. He has \nheld a security clearance for approximately 19 years. He is divorced and has two children. \nHis young daughter has multiple, severe health issues. (GX 1, Tr. 12, Tr. 60) \n \n \nApplicant disclosed the misdemeanor on his security clearance application. (GX 1) \nHe acknowledged that he was sentenced to six months of probation which ended in \nDecember 2016. He was arrested during a prostitution sting for solicitation and \npossession of criminal tools on May 2, 2016. He entered a plea agreement at the advice \nof his attorney. (Tr. 71) The charge of criminal tools was withdrawn (the criminal tool was \na phone), and he was fined. (GX 2, 3 and 4) He explained that he had gone through a \ndifficult, lengthy divorce which caused financial problems which he has resolved. \nHowever, the stress of the divorce and the stress of his severely ill daughter left Applicant \nfeeling quite low. He wanted companionship and he had a girlfriend for a while. However, \nshe suddenly left the relationship without a word. (Tr. 65) Understandably, he was \ndepressed, sad and lonely. \n \n \nApplicant read about a website called backpage.com that was used for solicitation.  \nOne evening, while at home, he searched the website and solicited an individual.  (Tr. 13) \nThis was the first time he had searched any website of this type. He decided not to go \nahead with any meeting with any individual on the site that evening. (Tr. 66) The following \nday, he received a text from the website, and Applicant decided to pursue the solicitation. \nWhen he arrived at the location, a young woman asked him why he was there and \nApplicant responded \u201cfor intercourse.\u201d At that point the door opened and two vice police \nofficers were pointing a gun at Applicant. (Tr. 67) He was taken to a holding cell and \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (GX 1) unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n \n\n3 \n \nbailed out. Applicant informed his boss the next day. (Tr. 69) He was suspended for three \ndays without pay. \n \n \nTwo witnesses testified by phone on behalf of Applicant. The president and the \nCEO of the company for whom Applicant works has known Applicant for about 20 years. \nHe knew the reason for the hearing and attested that Applicant informed him of the \nincident one week after it occurred. (Tr. 22) When he asked Applicant why he had done \nsuch a thing, he reported that he just wanted companionship and did not realize what he \nwas getting involved with. (Tr. 23) He also reported the incident to the FSO. The CEO \ndescribed Applicant as an excellent employee. He noted that this behavior was \ncompletely out of character for Applicant. He informed Applicant that there is zero \ntolerance for this type of behavior. He recommends Applicant for the security clearance. \n(Tr. 27) \n \n \nThe other witness, who is the contracting officer for the project that Applicant is \nworking on now, testified that she has known Applicant over ten years. At one point in \ntime, she wrote his performance evaluation. She stated that he was a go-to person and \nhis work ethic is strong.  She is also aware of the SOR allegation. Applicant told her the \nday after the incident. She does not believe he would engage in this type of behavior in \nthe future. (Tr. 43) She recommends him for a security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant submitted numerous character references from employers and \ncolleagues who each attest to his professionalism and reliability. His performance \nevaluations have been above average or excellent. Applicant has never had a security \nviolation in his entire career. He has never had any criminal incidents of any type before \nor since May 2016. He completed his probation successfully and attended a court ordered \n\u201cJohns\u201d class in August 2016. (AX B) He explained that the class educated him and \nhelped him understand the danger to both potential victims and the individual engaging \nin the solicitation. He was made aware of human trafficking. (Answer to SOR) He testified \ncredibly that this was a bad decision in a stressful time and was a one-time incident. In \nOctober 2019, Applicant signed a letter of intent stating that he would never engage in \nany type of criminal activity in the future. In addition, he consented to an automatic \nrevocation of his security clearance and waiver any due process protections. (AX A) He \nis truly remorseful about the poor choice and would not want anything to affect his family. \n(Tr. 80) \n \n \nApplicant handles stress at this time in his life by helping in the community with \nsoccer games. He also spends a great deal of time with his daughters. He does not drink \nor smoke. He has sought some counseling for a number of years. He still sees a counselor \non a regular basis, and now he has a support group. (Tr. 95,104) He was also encouraged \nto meditate to help with stress. He is in a long-term relationship and has disclosed the \n2016 arrest with his friend. \n \n \n \n \n\n4 \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \n\n5 \n \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \u201cConduct involving \nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules \nand regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. . . .\u201d Applicant\u2019s conduct establishes \nthe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 16 (c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; \n \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of . . . (2) any disruptive, violent, \nor other inappropriate behavior; [and] (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule \nviolations; and \n \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \nby a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing . . . . \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \n \n\n6 \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate \nthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n \nAG \u00b6 17(e): the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \n \nAll of the above mitigating conditions are established. Applicant\u2019s misconduct was \nin 2016. It was his only criminal incident in his entire life. He completed his probation and \na class. He was in a very low place in his life. He acknowledged the incident to his \nsupervisor and friends. He has now resolved other stressful issues in his life. He spends \ntime with his two daughters. He still attends counseling and has a network of support. He \ndoes not associate with any characters who have criminal histories. He has learned \ntechniques to handle stress. He was credible in his testimony that he would never do \nanything to jeopardize his family. He is in a better place. He has been through difficult \ntimes and realizes he made a very bad decision. He has been open and candid about the \nevent, thereby reducing any vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline E in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant was candid, sincere, remorseful, and \n\n7 \n \ncredible at the hearing. He has held a security clearance for 19 years. He has excellent \nreferences. He is respected by his peers and his supervisors.  He is a good father. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines E, and evaluating \nall the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by his personal conduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial): \n \n \nWITHDRAWN  \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nWITHDRAWN \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on September 13, \n2017. On January 9, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns \nunder Guidelines H and E. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nimplemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 15, 2019, and requested a decision on \nthe record without a hearing. On April 8, 2019, the Government sent a complete copy of \nits written case, a file of relevant material (FORM) including documents identified as Items \n1 through 6, to Applicant. He was given an opportunity to submit a documentary response \nsetting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation to the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on April 29, 2019, and did not respond. \n\n \n2 \n \nItems 1 through 3 are the pleadings in the case. Items 4 through 5 are admitted into \nevidence. The case was assigned to me on July 17, 2019. \n \nProcedural Matter \n \nI extracted the below findings of facts from Applicant\u2019s SOR answer (Item 3), his \nSCA (Item 5), and a summary of his security clearance interview with a DOD authorized \ninvestigator (SI) (Item 6). Item 6 was not authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. \nHowever, I conclude that Applicant waived any objection to Item 6. The Government \nincluded a separate footnote entitled \u201cNOTICE TO APPLICANT\u201d in the FORM to notify \nApplicant of his right to object to the admissibility of Item 6 on the ground that it was not \nauthenticated. In that paragraph, Applicant was also notified that if he did not raise any \nobjection to Item 6 in his response to the FORM, or if he did not respond to the FORM, \nhe could be considered to have waived any such objection, and that Item 6 could be \nconsidered as evidence in his case. Applicant received the FORM, which included a copy \nof Item 6. He did not respond to the FORM or otherwise object to Item 6.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 27, has been married since 2016. He has one minor child and an \nadult stepson. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2014. He has been employed as an \nengineer by the same federal contractor since 2011, initially as an intern and then full-\ntime status in 2015. He was granted a DOD security clearance in 2014.  \n \nThe SOR alleged, under Guidelines H and E, Applicant\u2019s use and purchase of \nmarijuana from about November 2016 through May 2017, which occurred while he held \na security clearance. It also alleged his May 2017 arrest for possession of marijuana and \nparaphernalia. Under Guideline E, it alleged that Applicant failed to immediately report \nhis May 2017 arrest, as required. In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted to each of the \nGuideline H and E allegations, without explanation.  \n \nIn his September 2017 SCA, Applicant disclosed that he had been arrested in May \n2017 and charged with two misdemeanors, \u201cpossession of marijuana\u201d and \u201cpossession \nof paraphernalia.\u201d At that time, he was awaiting a trial, scheduled for November 2018. He \nalso disclosed the following facts concerning his marijuana use: (1) First use: \napproximately November 2016; (2) Most recent use: May 2017; (3) Frequency: \u201cI would \nsmoke mainly on weekends and during stressful times;\u201d (4) Use occurred while \npossessing a security clearance; and (5) No intent to use in the future, with the following \nexplanation: \u201cDoing this has messed up my life, family and is affecting my job. This was \nnot worth losing any of these. I regret ever doing this.\u201d He disclosed the following facts \nconcerning how he obtained marijuana: (1) \u201cI would get marijuana from someone I knew \nto smoke;\u201d and (2) Frequency: \u201cOnce a month.\u201d He disclosed the following facts about the \nreasons he used and purchased marijuana: (1) \u201cThis time period was [sic] low period of \nmy life and [sic] was stressed out. During this time period I got married, had a baby, and \nwas moving to a new house;\u201d (2) \u201cI was stressed out dealing with my family and my life \nchanged drastically when I got married, had a baby and got a new house.\u201d (Item 5 at 28-\n29, 30-31). \n\n \n3 \n \nIn his SCA, Applicant disclosed that he \u201cvoluntarily sought counseling or treatment \nas a result\u201d of his marijuana use. He explained that he was \u201cGoing to a counselor to talk \nabout what has happened and dealing with my stress.\u201d At the time he completed the SCA, \nhe had scheduled his first appointment, but had not yet begun the counseling. (Item 5 at \n32-33). He also disclosed that his DOD security clearance had been \u201cdenied, suspended, \nor revoked\u201d in August 2017 because \u201cI did not report an arrest immediately and I waited \napproximately 40 days to self report.\u201d (Item 5 at 35). \n \nDuring his February 2018 SI, Applicant expounded on the facts and circumstances \nunderlying his marijuana use, purchase, and arrest; and his reporting of the arrest to his \nemployer. He reiterated that he was motivated to use marijuana due to various \ncontemporaneous stressors, including a new marriage, home, and baby; and issues \nconcerning his troubled stepson, who then resided with him and his wife. He also \nexpressed his intent never to use marijuana again, citing his job and family as motivation. \nHe admitted that he lied when he told the investigator that he obtained marijuana from a \nfriend because he did not want to disclose the name of his drug dealer. He purchased \napproximately 1/4 to 1/8 ounces of marijuana per month from the dealer. (Item 6 at 2-6). \n \nApplicant\u2019s May 2017 arrest occurred on a Monday between approximately 12:00 \npm and 1:00 pm while he was driving from home to work. The officer initially pulled him \nover for speeding, but asked to search his vehicle because he smelled marijuana. He \nconsented to the search, during which the officer found a container filled with one to two \ngrams of marijuana and a pipe. He was arrested and brought to the police station, where \nhe spent approximately 20 minutes before he was released. Approximately three hours \nfrom the time he was pulled over, he retrieved his car, which had been towed upon his \narrest, and then drove straight to work. When he arrived at his work location, he acted as \nif nothing had happened and did not immediately report his arrest. Applicant\u2019s criminal \ncharges were initially adjudicated in July 2017. His case was diverted to a pre-trial \nprogram for first time offenders. Because he successfully completed the tasks required \nof the program, including an eight hour course that specifically targeted marijuana use, \nhis case was dismissed in July 2018. (Item 4; Item 6 at 2-3 and 5-6). \n \nApplicant admitted to the investigator during the SI, albeit after initially providing a \nmore benign reason, that he knew that he should have immediately reported his arrest to \nhis employer and failed to do so because he felt really bad about it and was fearful that \nhe was going to lose his job. He reported it approximately 40 days after his arrest, after \nhe was advised by his employer that he would be required to complete a security \nquestionnaire for a new job assignment. Before completing the questionnaire, which he \nknew would require him to list his arrest, Applicant submitted an adverse report disclosing \nthe arrest to his security office. After receiving the adverse report, his employer revoked \nhis security clearance, relocated him, and disciplined him for the following reasons: (1) \nfailure to notify them about his arrest; (2) drug use; and (3) mischarging his time on the \nday of his arrest. The discipline included a one-week unpaid suspension, one year of \ntherapy, and a two-year probation which required \u201cheightened drug tests.\u201d At the time of \nthe SI, Applicant had not yet been subjected to any drug tests by his employer. (Item 6 at \n3-4). \n\n \n4 \n \nApplicant engaged the services of a therapist through an employer-sponsored \nprogram. He began therapy in late September or October 2017, initially weekly and then \nonce every other week. As of March 2018, he had not missed any sessions, which \nprimarily involved helping him cope with his life stressors with specific emphasis on issues \nrelated to his stepson. He described his stepson\u2019s issues, which included mental health, \ndrug use, and police involvement, as \u201cvery stressful.\u201d He did not provide any information \nabout sessions, if any, after March 2018. Without providing any records from his therapist \nabout his diagnosis or prognosis, he averred that he has not been diagnosed with any \nsubstance use disorder. Through therapy, he learned alternative coping mechanisms to \ndeal with his stress. (Item 6 at 2, 4 and 5).  \n \nApplicant began using marijuana approximately six to nine months before his \narrest. He never previously used any illegal drug. He knew that he was prohibited from \nusing marijuana due to his employer\u2019s drug-free workplace policy, and because he held \na security clearance. Thus, he intentionally separated his marijuana use from work, using \nit only on Saturdays and Sundays. He consumed marijuana by smoking it either in his car \nor in a closet in his home on each day of the weekend, which relaxed him and helped him \ncalm down. He has not used marijuana since the day before his May 2017 arrest. He \nused marijuana with his wife, who has smoked marijuana daily since he met her in 2014, \npurportedly for back pain. She does not have a prescription for medical marijuana, and \nhas no plans to discontinue her use, which has been a source of tension between them. \n(Item 6 at 4-5). \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2). \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n\n \n5 \n \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. (ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, 1993 WL \n545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying \ncondition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of \nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the \nGovernment. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)). \n \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)). \n \nAnalysis \n \n \n \nGuideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24:  \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \n \nThe facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s marijuana use establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline:  \n\n \n6 \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia; and \n \nAG \u00b6 25 (f): any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n \nNeither of the following potentially applicable mitigating conditions under this \nguideline are established: \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n \nGiven that Applicant did not respond to the FORM or otherwise specifically \nendorse the SI, while I admitted it into the record, I considered any facts contained in the \nSI that were not otherwise corroborated in the record for the sole purpose of evaluating \nmitigation and whole person. The facts and admissions contained in the SCA and the \nSOR Answer alone support the disqualification conditions of this guideline. However, the \nfacts and circumstances discussed during the SI, including other unalleged misconduct, \nnot only cuts against mitigation, but suggest that Applicant may have been minimizing not \nonly his behavior, but also the severity of the stressors in his life and overestimating his \nability to manage them.  \n \nAs a married adult with a new baby, Applicant chose to smoke marijuana every \nweekend for six months, knowing that he was prohibited from doing so while he worked \nfor a federal contractor in a drug-free workplace and held a security clearance. He \npurchased his marijuana from a drug dealer, a fact that he was less than candid about in \nhis SCA and during his SI. I applaud his efforts to seek out alternative mechanisms to \ncope with stress through his employer-mandated therapy. However, Applicant has not \nestablished a sufficient pattern of abstinence, particularly given the persisting stressors \nof his wife\u2019s continued daily marijuana use and stepson\u2019s ongoing issues, and the lack of \nany prognosis from his therapist. I am unable to conclude that his marijuana use is unlikely \nto recur and have doubts about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) \n \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information.  \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, together with the facts and circumstances surrounding his \nmarijuana use, including while holding a security clearance, and his failure to timely report \nhis arrest to his employer, as required, establish the general concerns involving \nquestionable judgment and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and the \nfollowing specific disqualifying condition:  \n \nAG \u00b6 16(b): deliberately providing false or misleading information; or \nconcealing or omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an \nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity eligibility determination, or other official government representative. \n \nApplicant has not established any of the following potentially applicable mitigating \nconditions under this guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate \nthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur.  \n \nIncorporating my comments under Guideline F, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s \nmarijuana use and his deliberate failure to timely report his arrest to his employer \ncontinues to cast doubt on his good judgment and willingness to comply with rules and \nregulations.  \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, an administrative judge \nshould consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H and E in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines H and E, and evaluating all the evidence in \nthe context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated security \nconcerns raised by his marijuana use while holding a security clearance, his arrest for \npossession of marijuana and paraphernalia, and his failure to timely report his arrest to \nhis employer. His lack of candor during the security clearance investigations process and \nother uncharged misconduct revealed during his SI further underscores these concerns. \nAccordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b:  \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n\n \n9 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

He \nowes over $2 million in delinquent federal taxes. He failed to demonstrate good \njudgment, reliability, and willingness to comply with the law. Clearance is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on May 10, 2017, \nseeking eligibility for a clearance required for his position with a federal contractor. After \nreviewing the SCA and the information gathered during a background investigation, the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on January 23, \n2019, alleging security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). Applicant \nanswered the SOR on February 12, 2019, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \n \nDOHA assigned the case to me on March 26, 2019, and issued a notice of \nhearing on April 4, 2019, setting the hearing for May 1, 2019. At the hearing, the \nGovernment offered six exhibits (GE 1 through 6), which were admitted without \n \n\n \n2 \n \n \nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, but submitted no additional evidence. I \nleft the record open, giving Applicant the opportunity to supplement the record, but he \ndid not submit additional documentation. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nMay 13, 2019. \n \nProcedural Issue \n \nAt hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to conform it to the \nevidence received. Applicant did not object, and I granted the motion to amend. SOR \nparagraph 1.b was amended to read as follows: \u201cYou failed to file and pay your Federal \npersonal taxes as required for tax years 2004 through 2014, and tax years 2016 through \n2018.\u201d (Tr. 19-20) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant admitted he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and was \nrelieved of his dischargeable debts in 2015. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) He denied that he failed to file \nfederal income tax returns and to pay income taxes for tax years 2004 through 2014, \nand 2016. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) He claimed that those tax returns were filed with the bankruptcy \ncourt as part of the bankruptcy court filing requirements. He also denied that he failed to \nfile and pay federal business taxes as required since tax year 1995. (SOR \u00b6 1.c) \n \nApplicant admitted that he owes the Federal Government over $2 million for \ndelinquent business taxes (SOR \u00b6 1.d); and that he is indebted to the Federal \nGovernment for three tax liens filed against him in 2008 for $148,104 (SOR \u00b6 1.e); in \n2008 for $24,185 (SOR \u00b6 1.f); and in 2009 for $4,176 (SOR \u00b6 1.g). Applicant\u2019s SOR \nadmissions, and those at the hearing, are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \nthorough review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: \n \nApplicant is a 61-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He graduated from \nhigh school in 1976, and attended college for some time, but did not earn a degree. He \nenlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1976 and served until 1982. He was discharged \u201cfor the \nconvenience of the government,\u201d as a machinist mate fireman apprentice (E-2), after \nsome alcohol-related misconduct. He believes that he possessed a secret clearance \nduring his service, but he is not sure. (GE 4) This is his first application for a clearance \nsince 1982. \n \nApplicant married in 1983 and divorced in 1984; he married in 1984 and divorced \nin 1994; and he married in 1996 and divorced in 2004. He is currently living with one of \nhis ex-wives. He has one son, age 18.  \n \nIn his response to Section 26 (Financial Record) of his 2017 SCA, Applicant \ndisclosed that he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2015 and was relieved of his \ndischargeable debts that same year. He noted that part of the debt he was attempting to \ndischarge concerned a failed business and \u201c941 taxes,\u201d which were not subject to \ndischarge. (IRS Form 941 is used to report income taxes, Social Security, or Medicare \n\n \n3 \n \n \nwithheld from employee's paychecks. It accounts for the employer's portion of Social \nSecurity or Medicare owed to his employees.) (Tr. 20) Applicant defrauded his \nemployees, (at some point, he had 500 employees) and the U.S. Government, by \nwithholding money from his employees\u2019 paychecks to pay their income taxes, Social \nSecurity, and Medicare, and wrongfully appropriating the employees\u2019 withholdings for \nhis own benefit.  \n \nApplicant further claimed that his 2011 through 2014 tax returns were rejected by \nthe IRS and he refiled them with his bankruptcy. He claimed he filed his 2015 tax return \nas part of the bankruptcy. He stated that he failed to file his 2016 tax return and pay his \ntaxes, because he was \u201cstill trying to finalize bankruptcy,\u201d and that he \u201cwill set \nappointment with local division to file and pay\u201d. (GE 2) \n \nDuring the 2018 interview, Applicant claimed he was working with the IRS, and \nwould maintain contact with it, to resolve his tax problems. He stated that all of his \nfinancial problems were related to his 1995 failed business, and that his failure to file \nand pay personal income taxes were the result of him losing all of the money he \ninvested and not having the financial means to pay his personal taxes or his business \ntaxes. (GE 3) \n \nThe record evidence shows that Applicant failed to file federal income tax \nreturns, and to pay his federal personal income taxes for tax years 2004 through 2014, \nand 2016 through 2018. He failed to file and pay federal business taxes as required \nsince tax year 1995. He owes the Federal Government over $2 million for delinquent \ntaxes. Additionally, he is indebted to the Federal Government for three tax liens filed \nagainst him in 2008 for $148,104; in 2008 for $24,185; and in 2009 for $4,176. (Tr. 18-\n22; GE 3) \n \nApplicant claimed that he filed income tax returns for some of the tax years \nalleged in the SOR. However, he failed to submit documentary evidence to corroborate \nhis claims (IRS tax transcripts for the years in question or copies of his income tax \nreturns). Applicant testified the last time he met with IRS representatives was in 2008. \n(Tr. 22) He failed to submit documentary evidence of any contacts, negotiations, or \npayment agreements with the IRS, or of having completed any financial counseling, \nexcept for the financial counseling he received during the filing for bankruptcy. Applicant \ndid not meet with the IRS to file and pay his delinquent tax years as he promised to do \nin his 2017 SCA. (Tr. 19) \n \nApplicant claimed that he has worked in the health care and defense industry \nmost of his life safeguarding classified information. He stated that he never had any \nsecurity-related incidents or a lapse of judgment handling classified information. He \nbelieves that his personal financial issues were caused by his business problems. He \nconsiders himself a reliable person who follows rules and is able to safeguard classified \ninformation. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nConcerning his tax liabilities, Applicant testified that he has exhausted all \navenues of relief with the IRS and he has not been able to come to a repayment \nagreement. He claimed that he has paid some taxes because he has withholdings from \nhis paycheck every pay period. He believes that he has demonstrated good-faith efforts \nby attempting to resolve his tax problems with the IRS. He noted that he has paid \nhundreds of thousands of dollars in attorney fees to resolve his tax problems until he \nwas unable to continue paying. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; and DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(Directive) (January 2, 1992), as amended. The case will be adjudicated under the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all \nadjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017.  \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered.  \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems:  \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems is well documented in the record. He \nfailed to file federal income tax returns, and to pay his federal personal income taxes for \ntax years 2004 through 2014, and 2016 through 2018. He failed to file and pay federal \nbusiness taxes as required since tax year 1995. He owes the Federal Government over \n$2 million for delinquent \u201c941 taxes.\u201d Additionally, he is indebted to the Federal \nGovernment for three tax liens filed against him in 2008 for $148,104; in 2008 for \n$24,185; and in 2009 for $4,176.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides disqualifying conditions that raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, mortgage fraud, filing deceptive loan \nstatements and other intentional financial breaches of trust; and \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nThe record established all of the above disqualifying conditions, requiring \nadditional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. Six mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \n\n \n7 \n \n \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2013).  \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions are sufficiently supported by the evidence and \nare, therefore, not applicable. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because Applicant failed to file \nand pay his 2004 through 2018 (except for tax year 2015) income tax returns and has \nfailed to file or pay business taxes since 1995. I find his behavior ongoing, frequent, and \nrecent.  \n \n \nApplicant indirectly claimed he failed to file and pay his income tax returns \nbecause of his business financial problems and his divorce. Even taking his claims at \nface value, he failed to establish that he was financially responsible under the \ncircumstances. He presented no evidence of reasonable efforts to file, pay, or otherwise \nresolve his delinquent tax filings or to pay his exorbitant tax debt.  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged that his failure to file his federal income tax returns \nresulted primarily from his lack of diligence. He neglected his legal obligation to timely \nfile and pay his income tax returns for 13 years. Moreover, he defrauded his employees \nby withholding money from their paychecks to pay their income taxes, Social Security, \nMedicare, and instead he wrongfully appropriated the employees\u2019 withholdings for his \nown benefit since 1995, acquiring a tax debt of over $2 million. \n \n \n\u201cFailure to comply with federal and state tax laws suggests that an applicant has \na problem with abiding to well-established Government rules and regulations. Voluntary \ncompliance with rules and regulations is essential for protecting classified information.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). This is true even if the returns \nhave been filed. See, ISCR Case No. 15-03481 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 27, 2016).  \n \n \nApplicant repeatedly failed to file his federal income tax returns and pay his \ntaxes. Moreover, he defrauded his employees and the Federal Government when he \nwrongfully appropriated the employees\u2019 withholdings. He failed to demonstrate the high \ndegree of good judgment and reliability required of persons granted access to classified \ninformation. See, ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 27, 2016). Applicant \ndemonstrated an absolute lack of financial responsibility. The financial considerations \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of \n\n \n8 \n \n \nthese factors were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \nApplicant, 61, failed to demonstrate good judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. \nHis failure to file and pay his income taxes for 13 years and his embezzlement of his \nemployees \u201c941 taxes\u201d since 1995, show that he has a problem complying with well-\nestablished government rules and the law. His evidence is insufficient to establish a \ntrack record of financial responsibility. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1g: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of February 11, 2019, Applicant owed $47,741 in Federal student loans in collection (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.i); that he was $1,429 past due on a student loan with a $14,562 balance (SOR \u00b6 1.k); and that he owed a collection balance of $222 to a state (SOR \u00b6 1.j). Additionally, he is alleged to owe a $257 collection debt for cable services (SOR \u00b6 1.a); a $120 charged-off credit-card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b); a $296 collection debt for storage services (SOR \u00b6 1.l); and a $5,635 judgment debt to a former landlord (SOR \u00b6 1.m). When he responded to the SOR allegations, Applicant admitted the debts without explanation. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and hearing transcript, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 43-year-old computer-aided design (CAD) designer with some college credits but no degree. He has never married and has no children. (GE 1.) In November 2017, he was offered a full-time position with a defense contractor (company X) contingent on him obtaining a DOD secret clearance. As an onsite drafter, he would access unclassified drawings and computer systems on a military base, but access to classified spaces on the base may be required to perform his duties. Company X has been holding the billet open for Applicant pending the adjudication of his security clearance eligibility. (AE H; Tr. 22-24.)

Connelley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n06/05/2019 \n______________\nDecision \n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant defaulted on his Federal student loans, rent, and some minor consumer \ndebts during periods of unemployment or low income. He recently made some debt \npayments, and in November 2018, he began a rehabilitation program for his student loans, \nbut more progress is needed toward resolving his student loans and a judgment debt. \nClearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn February 11, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing a security \nconcern under Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR explained why the DOD \nCAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \n\n2 \n \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn March 4, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). His case was assigned to me on March 22, 2019, to conduct a hearing to \ndetermine whether it is in the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. I scheduled a hearing for April 10, 2019. \n \nAt the hearing, four Government exhibits (GEs 1, 3-5) and six Applicant exhibits \n(AEs A-F) were admitted in evidence. A summary of subject interview, which the \nGovernment offered as GE 2, was not accepted into evidence on Applicant\u2019s objection for  \nlack of the authentication required under \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the Directive. Applicant and a \nwitness testified, as reflected in a hearing transcript (Tr.) received on April 30, 2019. \n \nI held the record open to May 10, 2019, for post-hearing submissions from \nApplicant. On May 7, 2019, Applicant submitted a payment receipt (AE G) and two \ncharacter reference letters (AEs H-I), which were admitted without any objection from the \nGovernment. \n \nFindings of Fact \n  \n  \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of February 11, 2019, Applicant owed \n$47,741 in Federal student loans in collection (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.i); that he was $1,429  past \ndue on a student loan with a $14,562 balance (SOR \u00b6 1.k); and that he owed a collection \nbalance of $222 to a state (SOR \u00b6 1.j). Additionally, he is alleged to owe a $257 collection \ndebt for cable services (SOR \u00b6 1.a); a $120 charged-off credit-card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b); a \n$296 collection debt for storage services (SOR \u00b6 1.l); and a $5,635 judgment debt to a \nformer landlord (SOR \u00b6 1.m). When he responded to the SOR allegations, Applicant \nadmitted the debts without explanation.  \n \n \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and hearing transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old computer-aided design (CAD) designer with some college \ncredits but no degree. He has never married and has no children. (GE 1.) In November \n2017, he was offered a full-time position with a defense contractor (company X) contingent \non him obtaining a DOD secret clearance. As an onsite drafter, he would access \nunclassified drawings and computer systems on a military base, but access to classified \nspaces on the base may be required to perform his duties. Company X has been holding \nthe billet open for Applicant pending the adjudication of his security clearance eligibility. \n(AE H; Tr. 22-24.) \n \nApplicant attended a community college from February 2003 to June 2006 to \nbecome a CAD designer while working full time for a builder.  (Tr. 47.) He obtained a \n\n3 \n \nFederal student loan for $10,846 (SOR \u00b6 1.c, duplicated in SOR \u00b6 1.k) in February 2003.1 \nHe worked for an engineering company as a drafter from April 2006 until August 2008. \nFrom August 2008 to July 2009, he held full-time employment in a CAD position with an \narchitect. He was laid off in July 2009, but then obtained a contract position with another \nemployer that ended in December 2009. (GE 1.) \n \nBetween March 2008 and August 2010, Applicant took basic computer science \nclasses offered online by a state university. (GE 1; Tr. 47.) He obtained Federal student \nloans for $2,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.h) and $1,750 (SOR \u00b6 1.i) in March 2008; $6,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) \nand $3,500 (SOR \u00b61.e) in January 2009; and $6,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.f) and $3,500 (SOR \u00b6 1.g) \nin May 2010. (GEs 1, 3.) He withdrew from college because he did not want to acquire \nmore student debt to continue in a program in which he was not fully invested. (Tr. 48.) \nApplicant defaulted on his student loans when he had to begin repaying them in the spring \nof 2011. (GE 3.) \n \nApplicant was unemployed for almost the entire year in 2010. He then held a \ntemporary position with a staffing agency from December 2010 to December 2011. From \nJanuary 2012 until August 2012, he worked in electronic commerce for a publishing \ncompany. Applicant resigned from that job following a notice of unsatisfactory \nperformance. He could not keep up with the workload expected of him. (GE 1.)   \n \nApplicant collected unemployment benefits while out of work from August 2012 to \nOctober 2013. (Tr. 49.) In October 2013, he returned to work for the staffing agency until \nMay 2014. (GE 1.) Applicant testified that he made a couple of $100 payments toward his \nFederal student loans at that time, but he could not maintain the payments. (Tr. 42.) He \nhad seasonal employment over the summer of 2014. From September 2014 to November \n2014, Applicant worked on and off as a contractor for a CAD business. He had full-time \ncontract work as a CAD technician from November 2014 until March 2015, when his \ncontract was not renewed for reasons related to his performance. (GE 1.) \n \nApplicant was unemployed from March 2015 to August 2015. He fell behind on his \nrent, and his then landlord filed for a judgment in May 2015. A judgment on affidavit was \nentered against Applicant for $5,635 (SOR \u00b6 1.m) in August 2015. Notice of the judgment \nwas mailed to Applicant, although there is no evidence that he received it. (GE 5.) \n \nApplicant regained full-time employment as a CAD designer in August 2015. He left \nthat job in May 2016 for a temporary position at higher pay with another employer. His then \ncohabitant girlfriend wanted to relocate to be near her family. (Tr. 50-51.) In November \n2017, Applicant was offered a full-time position with a defense contractor not far from his \ngirlfriend\u2019s family. The position in CAD, which pays an annual base salary of $42,203, was \ncontingent on him obtaining a security clearance. (AE H.) \n \n                                                 \n1 Based on the available credit information and the total principal balance ($34,959) of Applicant\u2019s Federal \nstudent loans, SOR \u00b6 1.k alleges the balance of Applicant\u2019s student loan in SOR \u00b6 1.c as of May 2012. (GE 3; \nAE A.)  \n\n4 \n \nOn November 27, 2017, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). In response to financial record \ninquiries, Applicant listed no delinquencies involving enforcement. He responded negatively \nto a question concerning whether he had any judgments entered against him in the last \nseven years. He admitted that he had some delinquency involving routine accounts. He \nindicated that he was in default of approximately $47,791 in Federal student loans, and \nexplained that he was working to lift the default status of his student loans with a collection \nagency. He also disclosed a $222 collection debt with the state (SOR \u00b6 1.j) that he claimed \nwas paid in November 2017. (GE 1.) \n \nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on December 16, 2017, corroborated that he owed \n$47,791 in Federal student loans in collection (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.i).2 The $222 previously \ndisclosed state debt, apparently for an unpaid parking ticket (Tr. 43), was reportedly in \ncollection as of September 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.j). A $296 debt owed to a storage facility from \nJanuary 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.l) was placed for collection in March 2014. (GE 3.) \n \nIn January 2018, Applicant left his previous job, and he and his then cohabitant \ngirlfriend relocated. He spent about 30 days settling in and then had temporary work for an \narchitect until mid-March 2018. From April 2018 to early July 2018, Applicant was \nemployed about 30 hours a week at $15 an hour for a company updating their social \nmedia. When Applicant and his now ex-girlfriend\u2019s lease ended in approximately June \n2018, Applicant moved in with a roommate, to whom he paid rent. (Tr. 63.) Applicant \nworked as a waiter for a local restaurant from July 2018 until February 10, 2019, when he \nwas laid off. (Tr. 53.) His income averaged $500 a week (Tr. 63), although he also testified \nthat work was \u201csuper super slow\u201d from December to February 2019. (Tr. 53.) Applicant also \nworked for company X on some technical tasks for about 40 hours total in 2018. (Tr. 27.) \n  \nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on October 24, 2018, showed that he owed $257 in \ncollection debt for cable services incurred in October 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). A credit-card \naccount that he had opened in November 2017 to improve his credit score became past \ndue in March 2018 and was charged off for $120 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). (GE 4.) Applicant testified \nthat he closed out his cable service account before he moved and was under the \nimpression that he did not owe a balance. Applicant testified that after his work for a local \narchitect \u201ckind of dried up,\u201d he was not able to pay the credit-card debt. (Tr. 42.) \n \nOn November 28, 2018, Applicant entered into a rehabilitation program for his \ndefaulted Federal student loans, which had accrued with interest and fees to $59,245.3 \nBased on his reported adjusted gross income of $14,406 in 2018, Applicant was required \nto make monthly payments of only $5 for at least nine consecutive months starting \nNovember 29, 2018. Once his student loans are rehabilitated, they will be sold or \n                                                 \n2 Equifax was reporting Applicant\u2019s February 2003 Federal student loan as past due for $1,429 as of February \n2012 and as past due for $19,823 as of November 2017. SOR \u00b6 1.k alleges an earlier balance of the Federal \nstudent loan in SOR \u00b6 1.c and is not an additional student loan. \n \n3 The account numbers for the seven student loans covered by the rehabilitation program match those of the \nloans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-I.i, which is also another indication that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k is an earlier \nbalance of the loan in SOR \u00b6 1.c. \n\n5 \n \ntransferred to a new loan holder or loan servicer, and he will be required to select a \nrepayment plan, which could be an income-based repayment plan. (AE A.) As of April 10, \n2019, Applicant had made his payments in November 2018, December 2018, March 2019, \nand April 2019. (AEs F-G.) He contacted the loan rehabilitation service to make a payment \nby telephone in January 2019, but his payment was not processed. When he tried to make \nhis February 2019 payment, he was advised that his program had lapsed because there \nwas no record of a payment for January 2019. He had to restart the rehabilitation program \nwith his March 2019 payment. (Tr. 38-40, 58.) Applicant had no explanation for his failure \nto address his student loans when he was employed full time in the past. (Tr. 61.)  \n \nApplicant had no income for two to three weeks after he was laid off from the \nrestaurant job in February 2019. He collected unemployment benefits at $340 per week \nfrom late February 2019 to early April 2019. (Tr. 54, 61.) On April 8, 2019, Applicant began \na 30-day temporary assignment for company X at $30 an hour. The job was expected to \nnet him $3,639 in wage income. (AE H; Tr. 24-26.) \n \nOn April 8, 2019, Applicant paid $207 in full settlement of the $296 debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.l. (AE D; Tr. 34.) On April 9, 2019, Applicant paid $80 toward the cable services debt \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) (AEs B-C; Tr. 30), and $50 toward the $222 state debt (SOR \u00b6 1.j). (AE E.) He \nplans to make payments on those debts until they are fully satisfied. (Tr. 30, 35, 57.) On \nApril 10, 2019, Applicant paid the $120 credit-card debt in full. (AE B; Tr. 30, 56.) \n \nApplicant testified at his hearing that he tried several times since mid-March 2019 to \nreach the entity collecting the judgment debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m. As of April 2019, he had no \nrepayment plan in place for that debt. Applicant does not want to promise payments that he \nthen cannot afford. (Tr. 44-45, 58.) \n \nCompany X invested training dollars for Applicant to gain knowledge of the space-\nmanagement software needed for his temporary assignments. Company X management \npersonnel attest that Applicant was very reliable and responsive in producing high quality \nproducts on schedule to meet customer delivery requirements. (AEs H, I.) Applicant \nprovided the SOR to company X\u2019s facility security officer (FSO). She met with him four \ntimes about his financial issues. Applicant has expressed to her his intention to repay his \ndebts, and that full-time employment with the defense contractor would give him the \nincome needed to move forward in that regard. (AE H; Tr. 24-26.)  \n  \nSince February 2019, Applicant has been sleeping on friends\u2019 couches to get by \nbecause his income was insufficient to obtain an apartment. (Tr. 55.) He gives his friends \nbetween $50 and $100 a week to cover their electricity or Internet costs. His contribution \ndepends on his own expenses for food, gasoline, car insurance, and job search. He paid \noff a couple of parking tickets during the first week of April 2019 and so gave his friends \nonly $50 to $60 that week.  Applicant drives a 2003 model-year vehicle and pays $80 a \nmonth for car insurance. (Tr. 62.) \n\n6 \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \n\n7 \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nAn applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage his finances \nin a way as to exhibit sound judgment and responsibility. The concern under Guideline F is \nbroader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly compromise classified \ninformation in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns about an individual\u2019s self-\ncontrol, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified information. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s record of delinquent debts trigger security concerns under Guideline F. \nApplicant defaulted on his Federal student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.i. Due to interest \nand penalties, the balance of his student loans had accrued to $59,245 as of November \n2018. A $5,635 judgment for nonpayment of rent was entered against him in late August \n2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.m). Debts of $257 for cable services (SOR \u00b6 1.a), $222 for apparently a \nparking ticket (SOR \u00b6 1.j), and $296 for a storage facility rental (SOR \u00b6 1.l) were placed for \ncollection. A $120 credit-card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b) was charged off in 2018. Disqualifying \nconditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations,\u201d apply. \n \nThe burden is on Applicant to mitigate the negative implications for his financial \njudgment raised by his delinquent debts. Application of the aforesaid disqualifying \nconditions triggers consideration of the potentially mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20. \nFive of the seven mitigating conditions warrant some consideration and could potentially \napply in whole or in part. They are: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \n\n8 \n \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant defaulted on his Federal student loans in 2011. His storage debt was \nplaced for collection in March 2014, and the judgment debt for rent is from August 2015. \nThese accounts first became delinquent some time ago. However, a debt that became \ndelinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, \nunpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as \nrecent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \nApplicant did not know about the cable services debt until he received the SOR. He may \nnot have known about the judgment for past-due rent, but he knew that he had defaulted \non his rent in 2015. He learned about the $222 parking ticket in November 2017. He \nclaimed payment of that debt in November 2017 but then began repaying the debt in April \n2019. His default of his credit-card debt in March 2018 reflects recent financial \ndelinquency. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not fully established.   \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) has some applicability. When Applicant was supposed to begin repaying \nhis Federal student loans in 2011, he held a temporary position with a staffing agency. He \nwas employed by a publishing company from January to August 2012, when he lost his job \ndue to poor performance. He collected unemployment compensation during the next year. \nHe returned to work for the staffing agency from October 2013 to May 2014, had seasonal \nemployment that summer, and then worked on and off until November 2014. He had full-\ntime work as a CAD technician for a few months, but then his contract was not renewed in \nMarch 2015 for reasons related to his work performance. He could not make his rent \npayments that spring because he was unemployed. \n \n \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to \ncircumstances outside of his control, I have to consider whether Applicant acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with his financial difficulties. See ISCR Case No. 05-\n11366 at 4, n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. \nMay 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether Applicant maintained \ncontact with his creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts \ncurrent. \n \n \nApplicant held full-time jobs from August 2015 until January 2018, when he chose to \nrelocate to his present area with his then girlfriend. There is no evidence that he made any \n\n9 \n \neffort during those two plus years to rehabilitate his Federal student loans. He had no \nexplanation at his hearing for his failure to take responsible steps to address his student \nloans at that time, despite knowing that his loans were in default. \n \n \nApplicant moved to his present locale in January 2018 with a contingent offer in \nhand for a position with a defense contractor in his new area. In his favor, Applicant did not \nwait for a decision on his security clearance eligibility to obtain income needed to support \nhimself. He worked for an architect from February 2018 to mid-March 2018. From April \n2018 to early July 2018, he was employed 30 hours a week at $15 an hour by a company \nupdating its social media. He then worked as a server at a restaurant, averaging $500 per \nweek in income, from July 2018 until February 10, 2019, when he was laid off after \nbusiness at the restaurant had been slow for about two months. Applicant reported only \n$14,400 in income for 2018 on an estimated tax worksheet provided to establish the \npayment required to rehabilitate his student loans. Even so, he should have been able to \npay the $120 credit-card balance before April 2019. \n \n \nThe Appeal Board recently reaffirmed that an applicant who begins to resolve his \ndebts only after being placed on notice that his clearance was in jeopardy \u201cmay be \ndisinclined to follow rules and regulations when [his] personal interests are not at stake.\u201d \nSee ADP Case No. 17-00263 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 16-\n03122 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, 2018)). In that regard, Applicant indicated on his \nNovember 27, 2017 SF 86 that he was working with a collection entity to remove the \ndefault on his student loans. While he took some steps to address his Federal student \nloans before the SOR was issued, he has not credibly explained the year-long delay in \nestablishing the loan-rehabilitation program. \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) has some applicability because of Applicant\u2019s payments in \nfull settlement of the credit-card debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b, in partial satisfaction of the cable \nservices and state debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.j, and in full settlement of the storage facility \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.l. Applicant expressed an intention to continue to make payments to \naddress the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.j. Applicant showed some good faith under AG \u00b6 \n20(d) by making payments since November 2018 toward rehabilitating his Federal student \nloans. Yet, his documented payments totaling only $20 are not enough to establish a clear \nindication that his student loans are being resolved under AG \u00b6 20(c), or to establish a \nsufficient track record of payment compliance under AG \u00b6 20(d). It is noted that he had to \nrestart the rehabilitation program in March 2019. Applicant may have reasonably assumed \nthat his January 2019 payment by telephone would be processed. At the same time, he \nwould have had a stronger case in mitigation had he entered into the loan rehabilitation \nprogram a year earlier. Neither AG \u00b6 20(c) nor AG \u00b6 20(d) apply in mitigation of the $5,635 \njudgment debt that has been outstanding since August 2015 with no efforts at repayment. \nApplicant is credited with attempting to contact the collection entity about the debt since \nMarch 2019, but as of the close of the evidentiary record in May 2019, he had no \nrepayment plan in place for the debt. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is established only for the student loan debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k. The \n$14,562 alleged is the balance on the loan in SOR \u00b6 1.c as of February 2012 and does not \n\n10 \n \nrepresent an additional student-loan delinquency. After considering the AGs, the financial \nconsiderations security concerns are only partially mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). The analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but \nsome warrant additional comment. \n \nAn applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off \nevery debt in the SOR. He is required to demonstrate that he has established a plan to \nresolve his financial problems and taken significant actions to implement the plan. See \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and quotation \nmarks omitted). Student loans are an investment in one\u2019s future and do not carry the same \njudgment concerns as a record of irresponsible spending or overreliance on consumer \ncredit cards. At the same time, it is difficult to conclude when, or even if, Applicant will \nalleviate the security significant financial burden of approximately $59,245 in Federal \nstudent loan debt in collection and a $5,635 judgment debt. He has lacked consistent \nemployment in 2019. As soon as he had the 30-day temporary assignment with company \nX, he made some payments toward the smaller debts alleged in the SOR. This suggests \nthat he will continue to address his debts if he is granted the security clearance that he \nneeds to become an employee of company X. \n \nIn exceptional cases, an administrative judge may grant initial or continued eligibility \nfor a security clearance, despite the presence of an issue(s) that can be partially but not \ncompletely mitigated.4 Applicant has been productive in his temporary work for the defense \ncontractor. He appears to live within his means, which are presently limited because of his \nlack of full-time employment. However, once Applicant\u2019s Federal student loans are \nrehabilitated, his loans will be sold or transferred to a loan holder or loan servicer and a \nnew monthly repayment amount will be established. It would be premature to apply the \nexception under Appendix C when repayment terms acceptable to his creditors are yet to \nbe established for his student loan and judgment debts. \n \n This decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the financial reform and rehabilitation necessary to be eligible for a security \n                                                 \n4 Appendix C of Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4 grants DOHA administrative judges the \ndiscretionary authority to grant initial or continued eligibility for a security clearance despite the presence of an \nissue(s) that can be partially but not completely mitigated with the provision of additional security measures. \nSee also Memorandum, Director for Defense Intelligence (Intelligence and Security), dated January 12, 2018 \n(\u201cAppendix C identifies authorized exceptions that are to be utilized when making adjudicative decisions to \ngrant initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or to hold a sensitive position . . . \nEffective immediately, authority to grant clearance eligibility with one of the exceptions enumerated in \nAppendix C is granted to any adjudicative, hearing, or appeal official or entity now authorized to grant \nclearance eligibility when they have jurisdiction to render the eligibility determination.\u201d) \n \n\n11 \n \nclearance in the future. After applying the disqualifying and mitigating conditions to the \nevidence presented, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant or continue security clearance eligibility for Applicant at this time. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.i: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j-1.l: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \n \n \n_____________________ \nElizabeth M.

He made significant progress and demonstrated good faith in resolving \nhis delinquent debts. There are clear indications that his financial problem is being \nresolved, and his finances are under control. Future financial problems are unlikely to \noccur. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.            \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn April 26, 2018, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA). On \nJanuary 24, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \nOn February 15, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR, and he requested a \nhearing. On June 5, 2019, the case was assigned to me, and the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for June \n25, 2019. Applicant\u2019s hearing was held as scheduled.  \n\n \n2 \n                                         \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered five exhibits, Government Exhibit \n(GE) 1-5, and Applicant offered three exhibits, Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-C. There were no \nobjections, and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. Applicant testified, and \none witness testified on his behalf. The record was held open for 30 days in the event \neither party wanted to submit additional documentation. On July 8, 2019, DOHA received \nthe hearing transcript. No documents were submitted, and the record closed on July 25, \n2019. \n \n \n \n \n \nPreliminary Matters \n \nDepartment Counsel made a motion to change the date on the SOR to reflect \nJanuary 24, 2019, rather than the typo of January 24, 2018. I granted the motion. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted that he owed all of the debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.m. He also provided mitigating information showing that the debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.a was being paid by monthly installments. Applicant\u2019s admissions are accepted as \nfindings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 26-year-old security site supervisor for a government contractor. He \nhas never married and does not have any children. He attended four years of college, but \nhe does not possess a college degree. He intends to return to college once his student \nloans are rehabilitated. In May 2015, Applicant left college and began full-time \nemployment as a security guard, but his income was insufficient to pay all of his monthly \nexpenses. In November 2016, he was hired by his current employer and his income \nessentially doubled. Applicant currently resides with his mother, and his monthly net \nincome is approximately $3,500. (Tr. 19-21, 23, 25-31; GE 1) \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe SOR alleges 13 delinquent debts, 11 of which are defaulted student loans. \nThe total amount of debt is $48,306, and the record establishes the status of Applicant\u2019s \naccounts as follows: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a delinquent loan account for $524. This debt resulted from \nApplicant\u2019s purchase of a motorcycle after he left college in May 2015. He stated that he \nwas underemployed in 2015, and he considered this as an irresponsible purchase. He \ncould not pay the monthly loan payments with his limited income. His mother was held \nresponsible as a co-signer on the loan. In 2016, she filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy. \nApplicant could have allowed the motorcycle to be repossessed, but he decided he \nwanted to be responsible for his purchase. The bankruptcy trustee had the full motorcycle \nloan payment of approximately $300 be deducted from his mother\u2019s pay each month. \nSince 2016, Applicant has consistently repaid his mother every month for the motorcycle \nloan payments. He provided documentation showing the loan account balance is $1,640, \nwhich will be paid in less than one year. The March 2019 credit report showed this account \nas \u201ccurrent \u2013 pays account as agreed.\u201d (Tr. 16-19; GE 2; AE C; SOR Response) \n\n \n3 \n                                         \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.k allege ten defaulted student loans with the U.S. Department of \nEducation for $45,090. Applicant received a student loan for every semester he was \nenrolled in college. He was underemployed and unable to make the student loan \npayments after he left college in 2015. In December 2018, Applicant entered into a \nstudent loan rehabilitation program. He has paid seven out of the required nine monthly \npayments to have his student loans rehabilitated. Applicant provided documentation to \nshow he is current with the $513 monthly payments, which are automatically deducted \nfrom his bank account. The delinquent student loans are being resolved. (Tr. 12-16, 22-\n24, 31-33; AE A, AE B) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l alleges a collection account owed to Applicant\u2019s college for $2,410. \nApplicant contacted a lawyer two weeks prior to the hearing to have this student loan \naccount consolidated with his other student loans in the rehabilitation program. The \nstudent loan account will be added to his rehabilitation program in the near future. (Tr. \n22-23; SOR Response) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.m alleges a collection account owed for an unpaid credit card in the \namount of $282. Applicant did not recognize this account, but stated it was his intention \nto pay this account in full by the end of the day. No supporting documentation was \nprovided during the 30-day period the record was held open. This debt is not resolved. \n(Tr. 33-34) \n \nApplicant has a monthly budget in place and lives within his means. He has \nmanaged to save about $3,000 in the event of an emergency. A co-worker and a former \nsupervisor of Applicant testified that he is a responsible employee. Applicant has been \npromoted over the last three years due to his outstanding work ethic. The co-worker was \naware of Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties with student loans, and believed Applicant was \ndiligently working to resolve the issue. He recommended Applicant be granted a DOD \nsecurity clearance. (Tr. 34-35, 38-39, 44-46) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n  \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d  \n \n  \nThe record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) \nrequiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \n \n  \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable in this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nThe SOR alleges 13 delinquent debts totaling $48,306, 11 of which are defaulted \nstudent loans. Applicant\u2019s student loan debt resulted from underemployment. This was a \ncircumstance largely beyond his control. In December 2018, before the SOR was issued, \nApplicant began a student loan rehabilitation program. He has made seven consecutive \nmonthly payments and only needs to make the next two monthly payments to have his \nstudent loans taken out of default status. He is currently in the process of adding another \nstudent loan to the rehabilitation program.  \n \nApplicant is current on his motorcycle loan and will soon have it paid in full. The \nonly remaining SOR debt alleged in \u00b6 1.n is a credit card debt in the amount of $282. \nApplicant did not recognize the account, but claimed he was willing to pay it in full by the \nend of the day of the hearing just to have it off of his credit report.   \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant was very candid about his financial issues. He made \nsignificant progress and has demonstrated good faith in resolving his delinquent debts. \nThere are clear indications that his financial problem is being resolved, and his finances \nare under control. Future financial problems are unlikely to occur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(c) and \n20(d) are established, and financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. \n    \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant has taken positive steps to correct his outstanding financial obligations. \nHe has two repayment plans in place with a long history of documented payments. He \nhas not developed any new delinquent debt. He has shown financial maturity with the \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \nestablishment of a savings account for unexpected emergencies. As a government \ncontractor employee, Applicant has quickly risen in the ranks due to his excellent work \nethic. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nand the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude \nthat financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.m:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n       Conclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or reinstate Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Pamela C. Benson \n \n \n \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

DOHA assigned the case to me 7 May \n                                                 \n1Consisting of the transcript (Tr.), Government exhibits (GE) 1-4, hearing exhibit (HE) I, and Applicant \nExhibits (AE) A-J. AE E-J were timely received post hearing. The record in this case closed 28 June 2019, \nwhen Department Counsel stated no objection to AE E-J. \n2DoD acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, effective on \n8 June 2017. \n \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \n2019 and I convened a hearing 10 June 2019. DOHA received the transcript 20 June \n2019. \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations, except for SOR 1.p which he was unable \nto locate, and which no longer appears on his credit report. He is a 31-year-old information \nmanagement officer employed by a U.S. defense contractor since April 2017. This is a \ndifferent contractor than originally sponsored his clearance (GE 1; Tr. Tr. 100-107). He \nclaims to have held an industrial clearance since 2006. He married in June 2016, and has \na 16-year-old stepchild. (GE 1). \n \nThe SOR alleges, and Government exhibits (GE 3-4) substantiate, 16 delinquent \ndebts totaling nearly $39,000. Applicant admits 15 delinquent debts totaling nearly \n$38,000. It appears that SOR debts 1.f and 1.l are the same. Applicant claimed to have \nsettled the debt, but provided no corroboration. \n \nApplicant reported SOR debt 1.b on his December 2016 clearance application (GE \n1), and discussed his financial problemsCincluding the SOR debtsCduring a January \n2018 interview with a Government investigator (GE 2), based on his March 2017 credit \nreport (GE 4). He stated he would investigate the allegedly delinquent accounts, and take \nsteps to address them. In fact, he had paid SOR debt 1.n in November 2017 [Answer \n(letter from creditor}]. He obtained a copy of his credit report in summer 2018, but did not \notherwise take steps to address the remaining SOR debts until after he received the SOR. \nHis December 2018 credit report (GE 3) shows most of the SOR debts remain unresolved. \n \nEnclosures to Applicant=s Answer show that in February 2019, he reached a \nsettlement agreement with SOR creditor 1.g, which was shown as paid in March 2019 \n(AE C, I). He reached a settlement with the same creditor for SOR 1.h in February 2019, \nwhich was also shown as paid in March 2019 (AE E) In February 2019, Applicant reached \na settlement agreement witn SOR creditor 1.i, which was shown as paid in March 2019 \n(AE J). He paid SOR creditor 1.j in February 2019 [Answer (letter from creditor)] In \nFebruary 2019, SOR creditor 1.m offered to settle the debt at a 45% discount. Applicant \nannotated that offer to reflect six monthly payments of $140. Applicant documented an \nApril 2019 payment (AE D, H) and a May 2019 payment (AE H). \n \nIn March 2019, the SOR 1.c creditor offered to settle the debt for one lump-sum \npayment, a 36-month plan, an 18-month plan, or pay the full amount with easy monthly \npayments (AE A, G). Applicant stated that he opted to pay slightly more than the required \nmonthly payment, but did not document any payments. In September 2018, the SOR 1.d \ncreditor offered to settle the debt at a 70% discount. (AE B). Applicant negotiated the \namount to an 80% discount, but did not authorize payments to begin until June 2019 (AE \nF). In March 2019, the SOR 1.o creditor stated that it would no longer  pursue the debt, \nand was returning the debt to the original creditor (Answer). Applicant claims the original \ncreditor now has no record of the debt. \n \n\n3 \nApplicant claims, without corroboration, that he has tried to contact the remaining \ncreditors with varying degrees of success, largely with no response from the creditors. He \nclaimed to have paid SOR debt 1.k by check, but did not document the payment. \n Although Applicant experienced brief periods of unemployment in June 2016 and \nApril 2017, he acknowledges that his financial problems are due to his inaction (Tr. 98). \nHe did not do what he was supposed to do when he was supposed to do it (Tr. 93). He \nand his wife earn about $175,000 annually, and have about $2,000 positive monthly cash \nflow. He has resolved to use his savings to address the remaining SOR debts (Tr. 88-90). \nIn addition to the thin documentation of his efforts to deal with the specific debts, \nApplicant documented no credit or financial counseling. He submitted no budget. He \nsubmitted no work or character references, or any evidence of civic or community \ninvolvement. His wife says he is frugal and trying to address their finances. \nPolicies \nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person=s suitability for \naccess to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented. \nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG & 2(a). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself, \nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the \nrelevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations). \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant=s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government=s case. \nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden \nof persuasion. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. \nThe Aclearly consistent with the national interest@ standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant=s suitability for access in favor of the Government.3 \nAnalysis \n3See, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns. Applicant accumulated over $38,000 in \ndelinquent debt due to his inattention to his finances. Despite being confronted with these \ndebts during his January 2018 interview with a Government investigator, he took no \nmeaningful action to resolve the debts until after he received the SOR.4 \n \nThe mitigating conditions for financial considerations provide insufficient help to \nApplicant. The conduct was recent, frequent, although the circumstances might now be \nconsidered to be unlikely to recur.5 The circumstances of his financial problems were \nwithin his control, and even if his two brief periods of unemployment were beyond his \ncontrol, he did not demonstrate any responsible resolution of his debts.6        \n \nApplicant has not documented credit and financial counseling, and submitted no \nbudget. His belated efforts to resolve his debts do not demonstrate that they have been \nresolved or are under control.7 The Government is not the collection agent of last resort. \nApplicants are expected to pay their bills because of their legal and moral duty to do so. \nThe late effort precludes a conclusion that Applicant has made a good-faith effort to \naddress his debts because he cannot show a substantial track record of keeping his \nfinances in order. 8 Moreover, he provided no work or character references, or any \nevidence of civic or community involvement to support a whole-person assessment to \novercome the security concerns raised by his current financial situation. I conclude \nGuideline F against Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nParagraph 1.

Cervi, Administrative Judge \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on February 1, 2018. \nOn February 11, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent her a statement of reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 28, 2019, and requested a decision \nbased on the written record. The Government\u2019s written brief with supporting documents, \n\n \n2 \n \nknown as the File of Relevant Material (FORM), was submitted by Department Counsel \non March 20, 2019. The case was assigned to me on May 29, 2019. \n \nA complete copy of the FORM was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \nsecurity concerns. Applicant received the FORM and submitted Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. \nGovernment exhibits (GE) 1 to 8 are admitted into evidence without objection. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old human resources manager, employed by a defense \ncontractor since 2012. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1999 and is working on a \nmaster\u2019s degree. She married in 2000 and has one child. She does not currently hold a \nsecurity clearance. \n \nThe SOR alleges nine delinquent debts and a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, filed in 2010 \nand discharged in 2015. In all, the SOR alleges $38,423 in delinquent debts, including a \nFederal tax lien filed in 2010 totaling $28,805, and a student loan collection account \ntotaling $6,814. Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations except for SOR para. 1.b \n(collection for a phone service provider) and SOR para. 1.c (collection for a cable service \nprovider). The SOR debts are supported by substantial evidence in the record and \nApplicant\u2019s admissions where appropriate. \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant noted that her spouse lost his job in 2010, \nand could not find similar paying work. As a result of the loss of income, Applicant claims \nthey were unable to meet their financial obligations and were forced to file Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy. The bankruptcy included $193,576 in unsecured claims, including $21,579 in \nunpaid Federal income taxes and $8,322 in state income taxes for years 2007 and 2008; \nand $13,684 in unpaid state income taxes for tax years 2003, 2006, and 2007. The IRS \nreport shows $36,703 in Federal taxes and $27,081 in state taxes were paid through the \nChapter 13 plan. Applicant claimed that they discovered their tax liability in 2010. She \nsaid the unpaid tax liabilities resulted from her husband under withholding from his pay.  \n \nThe bankruptcy was discharged in December 2015. The record shows a 2010 \nFederal tax lien for $28,805 remains on Applicant\u2019s record. (SOR para. 1.e) Applicant has \nnot provided documentary evidence that the tax lien was released, despite an opportunity \nto do so in response to the Government\u2019s FORM. \n \n \nApplicant claimed in her Answer to the SOR, that she is \u201ccurrently\u201d disputing the \ndebts alleged in SOR paras. 1.b and 1.c, but did not provide documentary evidence of \nthe disputes or evidence of their current status. Applicant provided evidence that the debt \nalleged in SOR para. 1.d (unpaid home owners association fees) has been resolved. \nApplicant\u2019s credit report shows the debts listed in SOR paras. 1.f \u2013 1.i became delinquent \nin 2017. She claimed the debts resulted from her involvement in an auto accident in \nSeptember 2017; however, it is not clear why her auto accident injury prevented her from \npaying her debts. Applicant provided some evidence of payments toward debts alleged \n\n \n3 \n \nin SOR paras. 1.g, 1.h, and 1.i made in 2018 and 2019, but the status of the debts alleged \nin SOR paras. 1.b, 1.c, 1.f, and 1.j is unknown. SOR para. 1.j alleges a student loan in \ncollection, totaling $6,814. Applicant claimed that this debt should have been consolidated \nwith other student loan debts, but was not. She stated in her Answer to the SOR that she \nwas investigating the account, but did not provide documentary evidence of a satisfactory \nresolution of the collection account. \n \nApplicant did not submit evidence that she independently sought credit counseling \nto assist her with her delinquent debts, although it is presumed that she completed the \ncredit counseling required by bankruptcy courts before filing a petition. There is no record \nevidence showing Applicant\u2019s current income, debts, and her ability to meet financial \nobligations. \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG para. 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02- \n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG para. 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFinancial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG para. 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG para. 19 include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n\n \n5 \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the record supporting the \nSOR allegations are sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions above. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG para. 20 are potentially relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant\u2019s unresolved debts have been a recurring problem that have not been \nsatisfactorily addressed. Applicant claims her husband\u2019s job loss in 2010 resulted in their \nChapter 13 bankruptcy, and her auto accident in 2017 resulted in additional delinquent \ndebts, but the record evidence does not support these contentions. Applicant is credited \nwith resolving or showing significant progress toward resolving debts listed in SOR paras. \n1.d, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.i, however, she has not shown substantial evidence that the remaining \ndebts were or are being resolved. Of particular concern is her failure to show evidence \nthat her IRS tax lien has been released and that her student loan collection account was \nconsolidated with other loans, as she claimed.  \n \nIn addition, the evidence shows that Applicant had Federal and state tax \ndelinquencies that date back to 2003 and continued for several years, in contradiction to \nher claim of first discovering the tax liabilities in 2010 as a result of her husband\u2019s under \nwithholding of taxes from his pay. I have insufficient evidence of Applicant\u2019s current \n\n \n6 \n \nfinancial status and her ability or willingness to satisfy her financial obligations, even \nthough she has been employed since 2012 and her Chapter 13 bankruptcy was \ndischarged in 2015. \n \nApplicant\u2019s long-standing unresolved delinquent debts, including a tax lien, and \nnew delinquencies accrued after her Chapter 13 bankruptcy, raise significant doubts \nabout her financial responsibility. She has not shown that continued financial problems \nare unlikely to recur. Mitigation credit is applied to the debts that were resolved, and for \nthe financial counseling she is presumed to have had as a result of her bankruptcy filing, \nbut no mitigating condition fully applies to the remaining unresolved debts. I have \ninsufficient evidence that SOR paras. 1.b and 1.c were disputed in good-faith and the \ndisputes resolved the debts, or that SOR paras. 1.f and 1.j have been resolved.  \n \nFinally, the debts included in the Chapter 13 bankruptcy were indicative of years \nof financial irresponsibility, despite Applicant\u2019s claim that the 2010 job loss was the source \nof her financial problems. I am unconvinced that the reasons for Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy \nhave been fully disclosed or that additional financial problems were avoided after the \nbankruptcy. There is insufficient evidence that her financial status is under control despite \nthe bankruptcy, and that similar problems are unlikely to recur. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG paras. 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. AG para. 2(d). \n \n \nAlthough adverse information concerning a single criterion may not be sufficient \nfor an unfavorable eligibility determination, the individual may be found ineligible if \navailable information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, \nirresponsibility, or unstable behavior. AG para. 2(e). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of \n\n \n7 \n \nfact and comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant\u2019s remaining \ndelinquencies remain an ongoing concern. She has not shown evidence of whole-person \nfactors sufficient to overcome the financial concerns. Accordingly, I conclude she has not \ncarried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national security \ninterests of the United States to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c, 1.f and 1.j:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d, 1.g., 1.h, and 1.i: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017. In a \nresponse notarized on March 15, 2019, Applicant admitted both allegations and \nrequested a hearing before a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nadministrative judge. I was assigned the case on May 10, 2019.  \n \nOn June 25, 2019, DOHA issued a notice setting the hearing for July 11, 2019. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered four exhibits (Exs.), \nnoted as Exs. 1-4, and Applicant presented eight exhibits, marked as Exs. A-H. With no \nobjections, all exhibits were accepted into the record. Applicant was granted through \nAugust 19, 2019, to submit any additional materials. The transcript of the proceeding \n(Tr.) was received on July 19, 2019. Documents accepted without objection on August \n11, 2019, and August 19, 2019, were marked and accepted as Exs. I-J, respectively. \n\n \n \n \n \n2\nThe record was then closed. Based on the testimony, materials, and record as a whole, \nI find Applicant mitigated all security concerns. \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 29-year-old mechanical engineer who has been in the same \nposition for five years. In 2014, he graduated with a mechanical and electrical \nengineering technology degree from a leading U.S. university. He is presently preparing \nto defend his master\u2019s thesis in the same discipline at a nearby university. He is single \nand has no children. He recently bought his own home. At issue are delinquent Federal \nand state taxes owed for tax years 2016 and 2017, amounting to about $32,500. \n \n \nDuring his first year as a defense contractor at his present job, Applicant was \npaid by a governmental entity: \n \nan untaxed, unreported monthly stipend with stipulations, strict \nstipulations, that [he] was not employed in any way and [he] was not \nreceiving a wage. When [he] tried to file [taxes] in 2017, [he] tried to file for \nan extension, but because [he] had missed the 2016 deadline, [he] wasn\u2019t \nable to file that extension.  And that compounded the problem. This made \nfiling taxes very difficult and confusing for an engineer, and [he] ended up \nmissing a 2016 tax deadline.  (Tr.9)  \n \nIn 2017, Applicant hired a CPA to complete his 2016 and 2017 tax year filings and set \nup payment plans. (Tr. 9) In the interim, Applicant became an employee of a different \nemployer that provides regular tax documentation and withholdings. During this time, he \nwas applying for a security clearance. As noted below, he ultimately instituted automatic \npayments on his tax obligations in the autumn of 2018.  \n \nWith regard to the approximately $21,148 Applicant owed to the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS) for Federal taxes for tax years 2016 and 2017, Applicant has \npaid this tax liability. (Tr. 19-23; Exs, F-G) He first began addressing the balances on or \nbefore October 2018 through automatic monthly installment payments. (Tr. 22-23) \nPayments were thus made until April 2019, at which point the reduced balance was \ncompletely satisfied by one payment made with the proceeds of a personal loan. That \nloan is to be repaid over the next 15 years at the rate of $700 a month. (Tr. 21) \nApplicant has had a zero balance owed to the IRS since April 2019. \n \n \nAs for the delinquent debt owed to his state for tax years 2016 and 2017 \nreflecting a balance of about $11,572, Applicant provided a July 2, 2019, state tax \ndocument reflecting that the tax years at issue have no outstanding balance, and that \nhe owes no state taxes. (Tr. 24; Ex. E) This sum was also satisfied from the proceeds of \nhis loan after he made regular monthly installment payments from October 2018 \nthrough March 2019, with his receipt of the SOR occurring between the last two monthly \n$1,000 installments. (An April 2019 installment for $1,000 was refunded when it was \ndeposited after the personal loan had already satisfied the debt. (Tr. 46)) \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \nWhen all his tax balances were satisfied in March 2019 with proceeds from his \npersonal loan, Applicant searched for a house. He was pre-approved for a mortgage in \nApril 2019. (Tr. 46) He also timely filed his Federal and state tax year 2018 obligations, \nfor which he owed approximately $6,000 and $5,500, respectively. (Ex. 26-27) In June \n2019, he bought a home valued at about $200,000 with around $8,000 down, then \nsatisfied his tax year 2018 tax liabilities. (Tr. 29; Exs. I-J)  \n \nEvery two weeks, Applicant is paid a salary of about $2,000. His monthly \nmortgage is almost $1,600, all inclusive of taxes, insurance, and fees. He has no car \npayment on his hybrid vehicle. He spends about $250 for food and utilities, $400 on his \nstudent loan, and up to $500 a month on any credit card balances. Consequently, he \nhas about $300-$700 a month to reserve for savings. (Tr. 36-37) He presently has \nalmost $9,000 in his checking and savings accounts, plus an actively open 401(k) \naccount. While recommended, he has not pursued financial counseling through a free \nor commercial entity. Going forward, he plans to pay off his personal loan, make \nprogress on his student loans, and seek a refinance on his home mortgage to seek \nbetter terms. To do so, he uses a budget. (Tr. 40) Both parties in this matter agree that \nhe has mitigated the security concerns raised under \u00b6 20(b) of Guideline F. (Tr. 47) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions \nnecessarily include consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the \nnational interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nUnder Guideline F, AG \u00b6 18 sets forth that the security concern under this \nguideline is that failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.  \n \nHere, the Government offered documentary evidence reflecting that Applicant \nhad delinquent Federal and state income taxes owed for tax years 2016 and 2017. This \nis sufficient to invoke financial considerations disqualifying conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the inability to do so;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations, and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \n \nFour conditions could mitigate the finance related security concerns posed here:  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5\ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nThe delinquent debt at issue was the result of Applicant\u2019s misunderstanding as to \nhow to treat his work-related income based on a stipend system Applicant did not \nunderstand. He apparently made no contemporaneous strides to better understand his \ntax position or how to proceed in terms of tax filing. Therefore, his situation cannot be \nsaid to have truly occurred because of conditions beyond his control. While he now \nunderstands the relative complexity of that scheme for tax preparation purposes, it is \nalso noted he now has his taxes deducted through his employer\u2019s payroll office, thus \nassuring this scenario will not be repeated.  \n \nFurthermore, Applicant provided documentary evidence that the entire delinquent \nFederal and state tax debt for tax years 2016-2017 has been satisfied. His evidence \nindicates that he was already in the process of paying off the debts through monthly \ninstallments when the SOR was issued. After he received the SOR, he immediately \nexpedited the payment process by switching from a monthly installment plan to simply \npaying all balances yet owed with one time payments. Although he has not yet received \nformal financial counseling, his efforts raise AG \u00b6 20(a) and AG \u00b6 20(d). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the her  \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Here, I have considered those \nfactors. I am also mindful that, under AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to \ngrant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment \nbased on careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nApplicant is a 29-year-old mechanical engineer who has been in the same \nposition for five years. He is presently completing a master\u2019s degree program in \nmechanical engineering. He is single and has no children.  \n \nBecause of the way his employer handled his stipends in tax years 2016 and \n2017, Applicant was deemed delinquent on his Federal and state taxes for those tax \nyears. He began satisfying his Federal and state tax obligations in 2018 through \nmonthly installment payments. Several months later, Applicant received the SOR and \nexpeditiously satisfied his entire tax debt with single payment to the IRS and his state \nafter taking out a personal loan. His decision to so expedite matters was at his option. \nThis process only requires an applicant to have a reasonable plan for debt repayment \nand documentation showing it had been successfully implemented, which he did. Going \nthe extra step, however, hastened the process of satisfying his taxes.  \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nApplicant now lives within a budget and the delinquent debts at issue have been \nsatisfied. Home ownership should help him by both reducing his monthly housing \nexpenses, and giving him a potentially lucrative investment vehicle. While his monthly \nnet remainder may seem modest, it is not inappropriate for a man his age and in his \nfield. Moreover, his income otherwise seems to well suit his monthly needs. Given all \nthese considerations, I find financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. \nClearance is granted.  \n \n   Formal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n                                  \n \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn January 25, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations and Guideline E, personal \nconduct. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines effective June 8, 2017 (AG). \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 26, 2019, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) on May 8, 2019. The evidence included \nin the FORM is identified as Items 3-9 (Items 1-2 include pleadings and transmittal \n\n \n2 \n \n \ninformation). The FORM was mailed to Applicant, who received it on May 13, 2019. \nApplicant was given an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not file objections or submit any documentary \nevidence. Items 3-9 are admitted into evidence without objection. The case was \nassigned to me on August 21, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all the Guideline F allegations, one Guideline E allegation \n(being terminated from his employment in May 2015), and denied the remaining \nGuideline E allegations in his answer to the SOR. The admissions are adopted as \nfindings of fact. After a careful review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 56 years old. He has worked for a defense contractor since October \n2015. He was unemployed from May to October 2015. From 1999 until May 2015, he \nalso worked for a defense contractor until he was terminated for misconduct. He has a \nbachelor\u2019s degree. He is married and has one adult child. (Item 4) \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 13 delinquent debts (collection and charged-off accounts) \ntotaling approximately $40,000. The debts are supported by credit reports from May \n2017 and September 2018, Applicant\u2019s statement to an investigator in March 2017, and \nhis SOR admissions in his answer from February 2019. The SOR also alleged that he \nwas terminated from his employment in May 2015 for misconduct; that he falsified his \nsecurity clearance application (SCA) from February 2016 when he failed to affirmatively \nrespond to questions about whether he left any employment because he was fired; and \nwhen he failed to affirmatively list on his SCA that he had been charged with an alcohol \noffense, as he was required to do. (Items 2-9) \n \n \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to helping his father with his medical \ndebts from 2011 to 2016. He claims the debts are unsecured pay-day loans and credit \ncards. He has no intention of paying the debts because he believes they are \nunenforceable against him in the state where he resides. There is no evidence of \nfinancial counseling. Applicant\u2019s debts remain unresolved. (Item 2, 5) \n \n \nA document from his former employer established that Applicant was terminated \nfrom employment for cause in May 2015 for downloading and watching movies while at \nwork, which his employer construed as timecard fraud. Applicant failed to disclose this \ncircumstance when describing this employment in his 2016 SCA. During his background \ninvestigation, he initially told the investigator that, consistent with his answer on his \nSCA, he was laid off from this employment. Upon being confronted with the information \nthat he was fired from that position by the investigator, Applicant so admitted. When \nasked why he provided this false information, Applicant responded that he did not like to \nthink about being fired so he chose to characterize it as being laid off. (Items 2, 5, 8)    \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nIn January 2008, Applicant was stopped for speeding by a state trooper. \nApplicant was returning home after having dinner out with his wife. He claimed that he \nhad not consumed any alcoholic beverages. He was given field sobriety tests and a \nbreathalyzer test. He was told he failed the field sobriety tests, but no breathalyzer \nresults are in the record. He was charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI). In March \n2009, Applicant pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of obstructing a highway passageway. \nIn July 2008, Applicant reported to his security officer that he was arrested for DWI \nearlier in January. Later in March 2009, the disposition of the case (pleading to the \nlesser offense) was also reported to his security officer. (Items 3, 5, 9)  \n \n \nWhen Applicant completed his SCA in February 2016, he was asked whether he \nhad \u201cever\u201d been charged with an offense involving alcohol. He responded with a \u201cno\u201d \nanswer. When confronted with the 2008 DWI arrest by the investigator during his \nbackground investigation, Applicant stated that he did not list this charge because he \ndid not think he had to because he was not convicted of the DWI, only the lessor charge \nof obstructing a highway passageway. (Items 2, 4-5) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nAll of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts remain unpaid and unresolved. I find the \nabove disqualifying conditions are raised.  \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent and all remain unresolved. He did not provide \nsufficient evidence to show that his financial problems are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) \ndoes not apply. Applicant presented some evidence that the debts were due to \ncircumstances beyond his control (father\u2019s medical debts, unemployment). He did not \nshow that he took responsible action to attempt to resolve his debts. I find AG \u00b6 20(b) \npartially applies. Applicant failed to provide documentation showing any efforts to \ncontact creditors and set up payment plans, or make payments on the listed debts. On \nthe contrary, Applicant has made a conscious choice not to address his debts and let \nthem fall off his credit record with time. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. There is no evidence \nof financial counseling and no indications that his financial problems are under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and   \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of \nsensitive corporate or government protected information; \n \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources; \n \n \nApplicant was fired from his position in 2015 for misconduct. He falsely \ncharacterized that event in his 2016 SCA as him being \u201claid off.\u201d He admitted to an \ninvestigator, after being confronted, during his background investigation that he had \nbeen fired and chose to deliberately conceal this information when completing his SCA. \nAG \u00b6 16(a) applies to SOR \u00b6 1.b. \n \n \nApplicant reported his DWI arrest to his security officer shortly after the event and \nlong before filling out his SCA. He pleaded to a lesser, non-alcohol-related charge. He \nwas under the mistaken belief that he did not have to list the DWI charge because he \nwas not convicted of it. I find that Applicant did not deliberately conceal his DWI arrest, \notherwise he would not have reported it to his security officer. AG \u00b6 16(a) does not \napply to SOR \u00b6 1.c. \n \n \nIn May 2015, Applicant was terminated from his employment because he was \ndownloading and watching movies while on duty. His former employer\u2019s records \ndocument this misconduct. AG \u00b6 16(d) applies to SOR \u00b6 1.a. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 17 and found the following relevant: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nHonestly completing an SCA is the initial crucial step in gaining access to \nclassified information. The Government expects, and must rely on, the honesty of \napplicants during this process. Therefore, providing false information at this stage is not \na minor offense. Likewise, engaging in work misconduct resulting in termination is not a \nminor offense. Such deliberate actions cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s period of \nunemployment and the financial assistance he provided to his father. However, I also \nconsidered that Applicant failed to resolve any of his delinquent debts. On the contrary, \nhe has chosen to ignore them and allow the passage of time to remove them from his \ncredit history. Applicant has not established a track record of financial stability.

Eligibility for a position of public trust is denied. \nOn January 30, 2019, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) raising trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F, \nFinancial Considerations. Applicant timely answered the SOR, requesting a case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of hearing. DoD conducts trustworthiness \ndeterminations for contractor personnel employed in Information Systems Positions \npursuant to DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and Security Executive \nAgent Directive 4, effective on 8 June 2017. \nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file of relevant material \n(FORM) on April 18, 2019. Applicant received the FORM on May 14, 2019. The \nGovernment\u2019s evidence, included in the FORM, and identified as Items 1 through 6, is \nadmitted without objection. Applicant provided a response to the FORM.

Based on the review of documentary evidence, I find \nthat Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns under the trustworthiness \nguideline. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the SOR financial allegations in SOR 1.a-1.l. She is a 40\u00ad\nyear-old employee of a defense contractor, for whom she has worked for approximately \nten years. Applicant received an Associates Degree in 2007. (Item 3) She has not \npreviously had a trustworthiness determination. (Item 3) Applicant reported \nunemployment from August 2006 until July 2007. She has been steadily employed \nsince 2007. Applicant is divorced and has no children. (Item 3) Applicant submitted an \napplication for a public trust position on December 6, 2017. \nThe SOR alleges, and Government exhibits (5 and 6) establish, 12 delinquent \ndebts totaling over $34,000. The majority of the debts are student loans and auto loans. \nThe delinquent debts include medical accounts and consumer loans. (Item 1) \nThe debts that Applicant accrued began in about 2016. In her OPM interview, \nshe stated that procrastination is the cause of the debts. Some debts she was not \naware of and some debts, 1.k. through 1.l, she stated were paid. (Item 4) Her credit \nreport shows that some of the accounts were paid as agreed until that year. (Item 6) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s 2018 investigative interview, she explained to the investigator \nthat she was seeking credit counseling and acknowledged most debts. She noted that \nshe would investigate the unknown debts and stated a general intent to pay her debts. \nApplicant began working with a consultant, but in her response to the FORM noted that \nshe was not happy with the results. (Item 4) \nIn response to the FORM, Applicant submitted a copy of her debt negotiation \nagreement with a debt relief company, which was signed on June 7, 2019. There was \nno information in the agreement that showed which delinquent accounts were included \nnor the terms and conditions of payment. It does, however, note a monthly deposit to \nthe company for $469 starting on July 6, 2019. She did not submit any documentation \nthat the payment was made. As to the 2015, state tax lien in the amount of $2803, \n(SOR 1.g) Applicant stated that she was not aware of this lien, but would begin working \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant provided no information concerning her salary, budget, or documentary \nproof that she has paid any debts. She noted that she intends to pay 60% of her debt by \nthe year 2020. \nPolicies \nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors to evaluate a person\u2019s suitability for \naccess to sensitive information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented. \nEach decision must also show a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). The applicability of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is \nnot, by itself, conclusive. However, specific guidelines should be followed when a case \ncan be measured against them, as they are policy guidance governing the grant or \ndenial of eligibility for a public trust position. Considering the SOR allegations and the \nevidence as a whole, the relevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). \nTrustworthiness decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s public trust position. The \nGovernment must prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the \nSOR. If it does, the burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \nGovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a public trust position, the applicant \nbears a heavy burden of persuasion. \nPersons with access to sensitive information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the required judgement, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels deciding any \nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.1 \nAnalysis \nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts started \nwith procrastination. Applicant\u2019s admissions corroborated with her credit reports, and \nfailure to provide any documentation of payments, establishes two disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. She has a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations and an inability to pay debts. \nApplicant does not meet any of the mitigating conditions (AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a-d) as she \nstill has delinquent debt, did not provide any circumstances beyond her control for the \ndebt, has not received financial counseling and yet has initiated an effort recently to \nwork with a debt relief company, she has not shown a good-faith effort in the past to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. She claimed she paid some small \ndebts, but provided no evidentiary evidence. In her 2018 interview, she promised to \ninvestigate the debts, but has not provided sufficient information to confirm her intention. \nThere is no information in the record concerning her salary. AG \u00b6 20(a)-d) It is \nimpossible to know if she is financially stable. She has furnished insufficient information \nto meet her burden. None of the mitigating conditions apply. None of the information in \n1 See, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                              \n                                             \nthe record supports a whole-person assessment to overcome the trustworthiness \nconcerns raised by her conduct. Accordingly, I conclude Guideline F against Applicant. \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1. Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a- 1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nUnder the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a public trust \nposition for Applicant.

The DOD CAF \nalleges in its February 2019 Statement of Reasons (SOR) that Applicant purchased and \nused marijuana from 2007 to the date of the SOR and deliberately omitted this information \nin responding to a question about her past illegal drug use in a security clearance \napplication (SCA). The record evidence supports an unfavorable decision. Applicant\u2019s \naccess to classified information is denied. \nHistory of the Case \nIn June 2016, Applicant submitted the SCA as a first-time applicant for a security \nclearance in connection with her employment with a federal contractor. Following an \ninvestigation, including two background interviews of Applicant, one in November 2017 \n\n   2 \nand the second in August 2018, the DOD CAF issued the SOR, which sets forth \nallegations under Guidelines H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) and E \n(Personal Conduct.) Applicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a decision \nbased upon the administrative record without a hearing before an administrative judge. \nOn April 16, 2019, Department Counsel submitted a File of Relevant Material \n(FORM) with five government exhibits (GE) attached. Applicant received the FORM on \nMay 3, 2019, and was given 30 days to respond. She did not respond to the FORM. \nAbsent any objection, the government\u2019s evidence is admitted into the record. On July 9, \n2019, the case was assigned to me. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the allegations in her SOR response. I have incorporated her \nadmissions in my findings of fact. Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from her \nSCA, GE 1, unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.  \nApplicant, 34, began working for her initial security clearance sponsor in April \n2016. In December 2016, her employment changed from being an employee of a \nrecruiting and staffing agency under contract with a prominent research university to \nbeing a full-time employee of the university with the title of \u201cResearch Associate 1.\u201d In \n2007, she earned bachelor\u2019s degrees in Information Systems and Marketing, and she \nearned a master\u2019s degree in 2011. At a later date, she also earned a Six Sigma Certificate. \nShe has never married and has no children. (GE 4 at 7.) \nIn 2007, Applicant began smoking marijuana after she stopped playing college \nbasketball. As a college athlete, she was drug tested and did not use marijuana during \nthat time. Since then, she has smoked marijuana \u201con and off,\u201d sometimes frequently, up \nto the date of the SOR. She also purchased marijuana for her personal use. During this \nperiod, she smoked marijuana by herself in her home. She stated in her August 2018 \nbackground interview that she intends to continue smoking marijuana in the future. She \nalso told the interviewer that she would stop using marijuana if she was told that it was a \nrequirement to do so to keep her job or to hold a security clearance. (GE 4 at 12, 14.) \nSince her graduation from college in June 2007, Applicant has resided in a state \nwhere it is illegal to purchase or possess marijuana. She knew from her college drug \ntesting experience that possessing marijuana was a criminal offense. The purchase and \npossession of marijuana is also a criminal offense under federal law. I take administrative \nnotice of the fact that marijuana is listed as a Schedule 1 Controlled Substance under \nfederal law. (GE 5 at 1, 3.) \nApplicant omitted from her SCA that she had purchased and used marijuana in the \nprior seven years. She also failed to admit to her illegal activity during her first background \ninterview in November 2017, even though the investigator questioned her about other \n\n   3 \nillegal activity in her past. The government\u2019s investigators developed information during \ntheir investigation that Applicant had used marijuana in the past and conducted a follow-\nup interview in August 2018. In that interview, the investigator confronted Applicant with \ninformation about her past drug use. Applicant admitted her history of purchasing and \nsmoking marijuana since 2007. She reported that she did not think it was important to \nadmit her use of marijuana in her SCA. As noted, she also admitted in her SOR response \nthe SOR allegations that she had purchased and used marijuana since 2007 and that she \ndeliberately omitted this information in her SCA. (GE 4 at 14.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant\nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \n\n   4 \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24 as follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in her SOR response and the documentary evidence \nattached to the FORM establish the following potentially disqualifying condition under \nGuideline H:  \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia; and \n\n   5 \nAG \u00b6 25(g): expressed intent to continue drug involvement, or failure to \nclearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse.  \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and (b) are not established. Based upon Applicant\u2019s admission of \nSOR \u00b6 1.a, Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana was as recent as her February 2019 SOR \nresponse. She has smoked marijuana over a twelve-year period, sometimes frequently. \nShe has provided no factual basis on which it could reasonably be concluded that her \npast purchases and uses of marijuana are unlikely to recur or that her drug involvement \ndoes not cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. Also, Applicant \nhas not claimed that she has taken actions to change or overcome her past use of \nmarijuana and that she has established a pattern of abstinence. Moreover, she advised \nthe investigator who interviewed her in August 2018 that she intended to continue to use \nmarijuana. Her comment in the interview about discontinuing her use of marijuana if it \nwas a condition of her employment or necessary to become eligible for a security \nclearance was never followed up with any mitigating evidence \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in her SOR response under \u00b6 2.a and the documentary \nevidence attached to the FORM establish the following potentially disqualifying condition \nunder Guideline E:  \nAG \u00b616 (a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \n\n   6 \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or ward fiduciary responsibilities.  \nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement is cross-alleged under Guideline E in SOR \u00b6 2.b. The \ndisqualifying condition set forth in AG \u00b6 16(c) is not perfectly applicable because \nApplicant\u2019s conduct is sufficient for an adverse determination under Guideline H. AG \u00b6 \n16(c) reads as follows: \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \nI conclude, however, that this Guideline E disqualifying condition and the general \nGuideline E concerns about questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations set forth in AG \u00b6 15, above, are established by Applicant\u2019s drug \ninvolvement.  \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; and \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant failed to make a prompt, good-faith effort to correct the omission of her \npast use of marijuana in her SCA. She only admitted her actions after being confronted \nabout them in her follow-up interview by an investigator following the development of \ninformation about her past actions from other sources during the government\u2019s \ninvestigation. She also failed to admit to her illegal use of a drug when discussing her \npast criminal conduct in her initial background interview. Moreover, the record contains \nno basis to conclude that her questionable judgment and unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) and (c) are not established. \n\n   7 \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d), specifically: (1) the \nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines H and \nE and evaluating all of the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse and her personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a - 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interests of the United \nStates to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied.  \nHistory of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on June 14, 2017. On \nJanuary 31, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. Applicant \nanswered (Answer) the SOR on February 17, 2019, and requested a decision on the \nrecord without a hearing.  \nOn April 17, 2019, a complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), \ncontaining six Items, was mailed to Applicant. He received the FORM on April 22, 2019. \nThe FORM notified Applicant that he had an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM. \nApplicant did not respond to the FORM.

He has been married since 2000, and he and his wife have \nfive children. Applicant received an associate\u2019s degree in 1998.

(Item 3; Item 6; Answer) \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant has twenty delinquent debts, totaling almost \n$35,000. The debts became delinquent between approximately 2009 and May 2018. \nApplicant admitted all of the alleged debts in his Answer. (Answer; Item 3; Item 4; Item 5; \nItem 6) \n \nSOR 1.a.

Applicant originally fell behind on his home mortgage in 2014 as a result \nof a period of unemployment. He was able to refinance his home in February 2016, and \nresolved the outstanding balance of almost $9,000. However, the November 2018 credit \nbureau report showed that the account was past due in the amount of approximately \n$3,026, and the total outstanding balance was $135,384.

This $4,486 medical debt was not covered by Applicant\u2019s insurance \ncompany due to a preexisting condition. It was incurred in approximately June 2011. \n(Answer; Item 3; Item 5) \n \nIn his Answer, Applicant provided no additional information regarding the \nremaining SOR allegations, but stated that the delinquent and outstanding debts were the \nresult of periods of unemployment and a reduction in pay, as discussed above. He did \nnot provide any supporting documentation in his Answer, nor did he respond to the \nFORM. \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n\n \n \n3\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \n \nUnder Directive E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for \naccess to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern under Guideline F is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n\n \n \n4\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence establish two disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), and AG \u00b6 19(c) \n(\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d).  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate those security concerns. The \nfollowing are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nOver the years, Applicant has experienced several professional setbacks that were \nbeyond his control. His medical debt is not an example of reckless or irresponsible \nspending, or poor financial habits. However, he still has a responsibility to pay debts that \nhe incurred, and he failed to meet his burden of production and persuasion to show he \npaid the debts as he claimed. There is no record evidence that he has made payments \ntoward the alleged debts. Therefore, Applicant has not demonstrated that he has made a \ngood-faith effort to repay his overdue creditors or resolve his debts. \n \n \nThere is insufficient evidence to show that his finances are in good standing and \nhe acted responsibly to address numerous delinquent debts. Applicant provided no \nevidence of credit counseling. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) was not \nestablished.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \n\n \n \n5\nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \n \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under the guideline at issue in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under this guideline, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns at issue. The record lacks sufficient evidence to demonstrate that he has \nresolved the alleged delinquent debts. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden \nof showing that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security of the United \nStates to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.t:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of \nthe United States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

DOHA assigned the case to me 3 June \n2019 and I convened a hearing 10 July 2019. DOHA received the transcript 19 July 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n1Consisting of the transcript (Tr.), Government exhibits (GE) 1-3, hearing exhibit (HE) I, and Applicant \nExhibits (AE) A-C. AE A-C were timely received post hearing. The record closed 24 July 2019, when \nDepartment Counsel stated no objection to Applicant=s evidence. \n2DoD acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, effective on \n8 June 2017. \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations. He is a 50-year-old network technician \npending a pre-employment clearance decision since November 2016. He claims to have \nheld a clearance in February 2002 and to have undertaken a polygraph examination in \nDecember 2006. \n \nThe SOR alleges, Government exhibits substantiate, and Applicant admits five \ndelinquent debts totaling over $24,000. The debts comprise $15,110 of delinquent \neducation loans, $8,200 in delinquent condominium fees, a delinquent telephone \naccount, and two delinquent medical bills. He has been married since 1997. His wife is a \nteacher. \n \nApplicant reported the delinquent education loans and two other detbs not alleged \nin the SOR on his November 2011 clearance application (GE 1). He discussed the SOR \ndebts during interviews with a Government investigator in June, August, and October \n2017. Applicant acknowledged the delinquent debts and stated his intent to investigate \nthe current status of the debts and make payment arrangements (GE 2). Nevertheless, \nApplicant=s December 2018 credit report (GE 3) reflects that the debts remain unresolved. \nApplicant testified that except for the SOR 1.b debt, he has not contacted any of his \ncreditors. \n \nAE A is an undated account transaction report showing some payments between \nDecember 2018 and 2019 on an account that Applicant states is his home loan, but which \nis otherwise unidentified, and is nevertheless not alleged in the SOR. AE B is a similar \nundated report that Applicant states is a credit union loan, but which is otherwise \nunidentified, and is nevertheless not alleged in the SOR. However, the documents \nhighlight the difficulty Applicant has had getting his finances in order. AE C documents a \n$2,000 payment made to the SOR 1.b creditor in June 2019. Applicant stated that with \nadditional fees and penalties, this payment was unlikely to have lowered the balance due \nalleged in the SOR. \n \n Applicant attributes his financial problems to his being unemployed August-\nOctober 2012, at a time when he was making about $90,000 annually. He then worked a \nseries of lesser jobs that reduced his income to about $15,000 annually. However, he \nwas laid off from his original clearance sponsor when the contract expired, and was \nunemployed April-December 2018. His current employer pays him about $50,000 \nannually, but is not his current clearance sponsor. \n \nIn addition to not providing any evidence of efforts to deal with the specific debts, \nApplicant has not received any credit or financial counseling. He does not have a budget. \nHis long-time friend and former coworker considers him honest and trustworthy, and \nrecommends him for his clearance. He is generally aware of the security concerns. (Tr. \n69-73) \n \nPolicies \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person=s suitability for \naccess to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented. \nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG & 2(a). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself, \nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the \nrelevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations). \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant=s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does,  \nthe burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government=s case. \nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden \nof persuasion. \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. \nThe Aclearly consistent with the national interest@ standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant=s suitability for access in favor of the Government.3 \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns.

On March 4, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline B, Foreign Influence. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); dated July 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 8, 2019, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on July 31, 2019.  The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on July 29, 2019, and the \nhearing was convened as scheduled on August 21, 2019. The Government offered two \nexhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 and 2, which were admitted without \nobjection. The Applicant offered no exhibits at the hearing.  However, he did testify on \nhis own behalf. The record remained open until close of business on September 4, \n\n \n2 \n \n2019, to allow the Applicant the opportunity to submit supporting documentation.  \nApplicant submitted seven Post-Hearing Exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-\nHearing Exhibits 1 through 7, which was admitted without objection.  DOHA received \nthe transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on September 9, 2019. \n \n \n  \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \n \n \nThe Government requested I take administrative notice of certain facts relating to \nthe Peoples Republic of China (China) because it is inclusive of the territory of Hong \nKong.  Department Counsel provided an 84 page summary of the facts, supported by \neighteen Government documents pertaining to China.  (HE-2.)  They also provided a 34 \npage summary of the facts, supported by eight Government documents pertaining to \nHong Kong.  (HE-1.)  The documents provide elaboration and context for the summary. \nI take administrative notice of the facts included in the U.S. Government reports.  They \nare limited to matters of general knowledge, not subject to reasonable dispute. They are \nset out in the Findings of Fact. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 42 years old. He is married with one minor daughter. He has a \nBachelor\u2019s degree in Electrical Engineering.  He is employed with a defense contractor \nas an Electrical Engineer.  He is seeking to retain a security clearance in connection \nwith his employment.    \n \nGuideline B \u2013 Foreign Influence \n \nApplicant was born in Hong Kong in 1977.  He grew up there before he, his \nmother, and brother came to the United States in 1995.  Applicant\u2019s aunt and uncle, his \nmother\u2019s siblings, were already living in the United States and sponsored Applicant\u2019s \nfamily to come to the U.S. Applicant went to live with his aunt, and his brother lived with \ntheir uncle, while his parents were still situating.  Applicant became a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen in 2001.  Applicant\u2019s father was a retailer, but was not the primary financial \nprovider for their family.  He did not move to the United States until 1996, and became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen in 2001.  Applicant\u2019s mother, who worked as a nurse in Hong \nKong, traveled back and forth from Hong Kong to the United States until she retired in \n2000.  She then moved to the United States permanently.  She became a naturalized \nU.S. citizen in 2005.  She also worked as a clinical nurse in the United States for ten \nyears before retiring here.   \n \nApplicant mother and father are dual citizens of the United States and Hong \nKong.  Each year, they customarily spend about six months in the United States, and \nsix months in Hong Kong.  Applicant\u2019s mother will be 74 years old this year, and his \nfather just turned 81.  They reside in Hong Kong part-time, as they find that because \nHong Kong is more condensed, they are able to be more independent.  They do not \nneed help, as they are able to take public transit to get to where they are going.  In the \nUnited States they had to learn to drive, and they are not good at it.  At this point in their \n\n \n3 \n \nlives, their health is beginning to deteriorate, and they will continue to stay longer in the \nUnited States, especially with the political protesting in Hong Kong, as they do not feel \nsafe to go back there.  (Tr. p. 38.)  Applicant\u2019s parents own a house in Hong Kong and a \nhouse in the United States.  As his parents get older, they ultimately plan to live in the \nUnited States full time. \n \nApplicant became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 2001.  (Tr. p. 29.)  \nHe obtained his college degree here.  He is married to a naturalized U.S. citizen and his \ndaughter was born in the United States.  Since then, he has traveled to Hong Kong or \nChina about three times for vacation and on each occasion he stays no longer than \nthree weeks.  (Tr. p. 30.)  His most recent trip to Hong Kong was in March 2018.  Before \nApplicant received his U.S. passport, he used his ID card issued by the Chinese \ngovernment to enter Hong Kong.  After he received his U.S. passport and since \napplying for a security clearance he only uses his U.S. Passport.  He states that he is \nwilling to surrender his foreign ID card and renounce his Hong Kong citizenship.  (Tr. p. \n51.)  When he travels to Hong Kong he stays at his in-laws house where his brother-in-\nlaw lives.  His in-laws reside in the United States.  Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a U.S. \ncitizen and his father-in-law is a green card holder, or permanent legal resident.  (Tr. p. \n31.)  Applicant has little or no contact with his brother-in-law in Hong Kong. \n   \nApplicant also has two long-time friends, he considers to be his best friends in \nHong Kong that he maintains contact with through messaging and texting.  One he has \nknown since junior high school, the other is a childhood friend.  One works in the quality \ncontrol department for a barbeque grill, the other sells water filters.  Neither of them \nhave any connections or affiliation with the Chinese government.  They know that \nApplicant works for a defense contractor and that he is an Electrical Engineer.  \nApplicant messages one of them weekly, the other less frequently.   \n \nApplicant has also formed close friends since relocating to the United States.  \nOver the years, he has also established some wealth and purchased a house.   \n \nApplicant credibly testified that he cannot be coerced into divulging any national \nsecurity secrets.   He also stated that he believes that his limited relationships with any \nof his family members or friends in Hong Kong cannot threaten him to do anything \nagainst the interests of the United States.  Applicant has never been approached, \nconfronted, or contacted by any foreign entity attempting to obtain protected \ninformation.  In the event that this ever occurs, Applicant stated that he will immediately \ncontact the DoD security officer and report the incident.  (Tr. pp. 53-54.)   \n \nPerformance appraisals of the Applicant for the years 2016, 2017, 2018 and part \nof 2019 reflect that he has consistently exceeded job requirements.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-\nHearing Exhibits 1 through 5.)  \n \nLetters of reference from two of Applicant\u2019s managers attest to his honesty, \nintegrity, hardworking nature and trustworthiness.  He is considered to be an asset to \ntheir company and the United States.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits 6 and 7.)    \n \n\n \n4 \n \nNotice \n \nI have taken administrative notice of the following information concerning the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (China).   Targeting and collection of US political, military, \neconomic, and technical information by foreign intelligence services continues \nunabated.  China is one of the most aggressive collectors of U.S. economic information \nand technology.  China\u2019s intelligence services, as well as private companies and other \nentities, frequently seek to exploit Chinese citizens or persons with family ties to China \nwho can use their insider access to corporate networks to steal secrets using removable \nmedia devices or e-mail.  Chinese actors are the world\u2019s most active and persistent \nperpetrators of economic espionage.  Chinese attempts to collect U.S. technological \nand economic information will continue at a high level and will represent a growing and \npersistent threat to U.S. economic security.   The nature of the cyber threat will evolve \nwith continuing technological advances in the global information environment.  (HE 2) \n \nI have also taken administrative notice of the following information concerning \nHong Kong.  Hong Kong is a presidential-limited democracy and special administrative \nregion of the People\u2019s Republic of China with a population of over 7 million people.  As \na special administrative region, its foreign relations and defense are the responsibility of \nChina.   However, Hong Kong is a customs territory and economic entity separate from \nChina and is able to enter into international agreements on its own behalf in \ncommercial, economic, and certain legal matters.  The United States and Hong Kong \nhave enjoyed a robust relationship, as stated in the U.S. \u2013 Hong Kong Policy Act of \n1992 and grounded in the determination to promote Hong Kong\u2019s prosperity, freedom \nand way of life.  The United States enjoys substantial economic ties with Hong Kong \nand U.S. companies generally have a favorable view of Hong Kong\u2019s business \nenvironment.  Hong Kong is an independent body from China, participates as a full \nmember of several international economic organizations such as The World Trade \nOrganization, Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum and Financial Action Task \nForce.   The Government of Hong Kong generally respects human rights of residents \nand the law and judiciary generally provide an effective means of dealing with individual \ninstances of abuse.  The basic law in Hong Kong provides for the protection against \nhuman rights abuses.  There is freedom of speech, of the press, and of publication.  \nAdditionally, Hong Kong\u2019s basic law protects the citizen\u2019s freedom of expression, \nfreedom of peaceful assembly, freedom of religion, and freedom of movement.  Hong \nKong has also passed laws to combat discrimination and is clearly committed to liberty, \njustice, and fair treatment, of their citizens through an effective government framework. \nHong Kong is a global partner to the United States and shares much of the same \nhuman rights and economic views.  There are more than 1,300 U.S. firms in Hong Kong \nand approximately 85,000 American residents in Hong Kong.   (HE 1) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s foreign family members are dual citizens of both the United States \nand Hong Kong.  They live part-time in the U.S. and part-time in Hong Kong.  His two \nforeign friends are only citizens and residents of Hong Kong.  Applicant maintains \nminimal contact with his family and two friends there.  Applicant\u2019s ties to his foreign \nfamily members and friends in Hong Kong pose a heightened security risk for the United \nStates Government.  The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 and two of them are applicable in this case.   \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \n\n \n7 \n \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent \nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation. \n \n \nFamily ties in a foreign country raises a prima facie security concern that \nrequired the applicant to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation \nsufficient to meet the burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a  security clearance for him.  Thus, Applicant bears the \nburden to establish that his relatives are not vulnerable to influence, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress.  In this case, Applicant carefully explained that his parents are \nUnited States citizens.  They live here part-time.  They only know that Applicant is an \nengineer and nothing more about his job.  Applicant\u2019s conversations with them are \nminimal, casual, and infrequent and done through messaging or texting.  His parents \nare not affiliated in any way with any foreign government.   \n \n \nApplicant also has two friends in Hong Kong that he maintains minimal contact \nwith, but they have no specific knowledge of what he does, or that he is applying for a \nsecurity clearance.  It is recognized that Applicant is at a higher risk of being targeted \nfor Chinese intelligence gathering since he works for a defense contractor.  Applicant \nhas lived in the U.S. since 1995 and has been a naturalized citizen since 2001.  \nApplicant is willing to surrender his Hong Kong ID Card and renounce his foreign \ncitizenship.  Going forward he will only use his U.S. passport for any foreign travel no \nmatter what the inconveniences.  Thus, it can be assumed that he will continue to place \nthe interest of the U.S. paramount, and always protect the U.S. from any risk of \nterrorism, and/or any situation that could place the interests of the U.S. in jeopardy.  \nApplicant must continue to demonstrate allegiance, commitment and loyalty to the U.S. \ngovernment in every instance.  Under the circumstances, Applicant has met this burden \nand has established two mitigating conditions set forth above under Guideline B.      \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n8 \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nApplicant is a mature, intelligent man, who performs well at his job, and has the \nendorsement of his managers.  It is noted that while he was born in Hong Kong, he is \nan American by choice. With his wife and daughter as his closest family ties, he has \nestablished his own life here in the United States.  He has also acquired significant \nassets, including a house in the United States.    \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Foreign Influence security concerns.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 40 years old and an Air Force Veteran. She has an associate\u2019s degree from the Community College of the Air Force. She has one minor child, and is married. She is employed by a defense contractor as a Senior Logistics Manager. She is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with her employment. Guideline F - Financial Considerations The Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because she made financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about her reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. The SOR identified fourteen delinquent debts totaling approximately $22,000. Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR. Credit reports of the Applicant dated March 1, 2018; December 18, 2018; and June 11, 2019, reflect that the debts were at that time still owing. (Government Exhibits 4, 5 and 6.)

(Government Exhibit 1.) On April 25, 2019, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of \nReasons \n(SOR), \ndetailing \nsecurity \nconcerns \nunder \nGuideline \nF, \nFinancial \nConsiderations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information, effective within the DoD after June 8, \n2017.  \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (Answer) on May 14, 2019. (Government \nExhibit 1.)  She requested that her case be decided by an administrative judge on the \nwritten record. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on June \n11, 2019.   A complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing six \n\n \n2 \n \nItems was received by Applicant on June 21, 2019.  She was afforded an opportunity to \nfile objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days \nof receipt of the FORM.  Applicant submitted a response to the FORM within the 30-day \nperiod.  Her response dated July 15, 2019, consists of 40 pages, referred to as \nApplicant\u2019s Response to FORM, was admitted into evidence without objection.  DOHA \nassigned the case to me on August 12, 2019.  \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 40 years old and an Air Force Veteran.  She has an associate\u2019s \ndegree from the Community College of the Air Force.  She has one minor child, and is \nmarried.  She is employed by a defense contractor as a Senior Logistics Manager.  She \nis seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with her employment.    \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because she \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about her \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  \n \nThe SOR identified fourteen delinquent debts totaling approximately $22,000.  \nApplicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR.  Credit reports of the \nApplicant dated March 1, 2018; December 18, 2018; and June 11, 2019, reflect that the \ndebts were at that time still owing.  (Government Exhibits 4, 5 and 6.) \n \nApplicant served in the United States Air Force from 1997 to 2018, when she \nretired honorably as a Master Sergeant E-7.  During her military career, she held a \nsecurity clearance without incident, and was deployed numerous times.  She received \naccolades from these deployments, to include Good Conduct Medals, longevity ribbons, \nAchievement and Commendation Medals, and campaign ribbons.  Applicant receives a \nretirement pension of $1,557 monthly and 100% disability compensation of $3,364 \nmonthly.  She also receives $400 monthly in child support.  (Response to FORM.)  \n \nApplicant began working for her current employer in January 2019, and earns a \nyearly salary of $92,700.  She attributes her excessive debt and financial difficulties to a \nnumber of unfortunate events.  In 2002, she was married to a man who had bad credit.  \nEverything they purchased was in her name, and when they divorced in 2006, she was \nleft with all of the debt incurred during the marriage totaling approximately $20,000.  At \nthat time she was a Staff Sergeant E-5.  A year after the divorce, she was unwed and \nbecame pregnant, and had a premature child in 2008.  But her real financial difficulty \nstarted in January 2016, when her father was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer.  \nApplicant applied for a humanitarian assignment and received orders that moved her \ncloser to her parents, although they were still in different states.  Applicant incurred \nmoving costs and child care expenses.  Applicant also got married.  She incurred even \nmore debt as she attempted to maintain two households, making the mortgage payment \n\n \n3 \n \non her house in state A, and paying the rent on her townhouse in state B.  When she \nrented out her house in State A to tenants, they failed to pay the electric, water, trash \nand rent in a timely manner.  The tenants never actually put the utilities into their name \nand so the Applicant received an electric bill of $500; a water bill of $200; and a trash \nbill, and was paying the mortgage while waiting for them to pay their rent, on top of \npaying her own rent in state B.   In addition, Applicant provided financial assistance to \nher father by visiting on the weekends, and assisting with some of his financial \nobligations.  Applicant\u2019s spouse was then diagnosed with Lupus and was unable to \nwork.  After her gall bladder was removed, she spent two weeks in the hospital and filed \nfor disability.  (Response to FORM.)  \n   \nThe bills continued to accumulate.  Applicant states that she attempted to get \ncredit counseling and a consolidation loan to pay off her debt, but eventually cancelled \nthe program because they did not adhere to the contract.  Applicant states that she then \nstarted to pay off the debt on her own, which subsequently turned the debts into charge-\noffs.  (Response to FORM.)        \n \n   The following delinquent debts are set forth in the SOR: \n \n1.a. Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $9,136.  This was money Applicant used to help with the \nhumanitarian assignment she took in 2016.  Applicant had included it in the credit \ncounseling program.  She states that she intends to pay the debt as soon as possible.  \n(Government Exhibit 3.)           \n \n1.b.  Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $6,002.  This debt was included in the credit counseling \nprogram.   She states that she intends to resolve the debt as soon as possible.  \n(Government Exhibit 3.) \n \n1.c.   Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $2,266.  This debt was included in the credit counseling \nprogram.  She states that she intends to resolve the debt as soon as possible.  \n(Government Exhibit 3.)        \n \n1.d.  Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $687.  This debt was included in the credit counseling program.  \nShe states that she is currently paying on this account, but provided nothing more.  \n(Government Exhibit 3.)       \n       \n1.e.  Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $554.  This debt was included in the credit counseling program.  \nShe states that she is currently paying on this account, but provided nothing more.  \n(Government Exhibit 3.)       \n \n1.f.  Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $538.  This debt was included in the credit counseling program. \n\n \n4 \n \nShe states that she intends to resolve this debt as soon as possible.  (Government \nExhibit 3.) \n \n1.g. Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection in \nthe approximate amount of $468.   She disputes this debt.  Applicant contends that she \nwas erroneously charged for cable equipment that was turned in.  Applicant provided \nnothing more.  (Government Exhibit 3.)      \n \n1.h.  Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection in \nthe approximate amount of $344.   This loan was included in the credit counseling \nprogram.   She states that she is currently paying on this account, but provides nothing \nmore.  (Government Exhibit 3.)  \n \n1.i.   Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was charged off in the \namount of approximate amount of $1,613.  This loan was included in the credit \ncounseling program.   Applicant claims that she paid this debt off in February 2018, but \nprovides nothing more.  (Government Exhibit 3.)     \n \n1.j.  Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection in \nthe approximate amount of $872.  This was for a home monitoring service that Applicant \nbelieves she has paid.  She states that she wanted to dispute the debt but has now \ndecided to pay it.  (Government Exhibit 3.)               \n \n \nApplicant states that there were other debts that were not listed in the SOR that \nshe has paid in full.  (Government Exhibit 3.)  She also states that she is making \npayments on the ten debts listed in the SOR.  She prepared a financial budget plan that \nwas scheduled to start on July 5, 2019, that would include each of the delinquent debts \nlisted in the SOR.  (Response to FORM.)  However, there is no evidence in the record \nthat she has started or followed this budget.   \n \n \nApplicant explained that she became indebted not because she was involved in \nfrivolous spending, but because she spent money to help take care of her family during \nhardships.  She hopes to be able to purchase another home in the future, and so she is \nworking hard to improve her credit.    She believes that if her security clearance is \ngranted she will be able to have all of the debts listed in the SOR paid off within one \nyear.   \n \n \nLetters of recommendation from professional associates and friends attest to \nApplicant\u2019s high integrity, excellent work ethic, professionalism, and respect honoring \nthe Air Force values.  She is described as loyal to her country, reliable and trustworthy.  \nWithout hesitation, they recommend Applicant for a security clearance.  (Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits 4, 5 and 6.) \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision.  The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept.  The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant incurred excessive debt that she has been unable to pay.  She states \nthat she intends to pay it, but has not provided proof of payment in any form.  The \nevidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \n \n  \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nand   \n  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n  \nIt is not clear from the record evidence whether Applicant spent beyond her \nmeans in accumulating this debt.  What is clear is that Applicant\u2019s financial distress was \npartially caused by circumstances beyond her control, namely life circumstances.  What \nis also clear is the fact that Applicant earns a good living.  Why her indebtedness is so \n\n \n7 \n \ngreat is puzzling.  She acknowledges the debts in the SOR and avers that she intends \nto handle them, but she does not explain what she is doing specifically to resolve them.   \nThere are no receipts in the record, proof of payment, or letters from the creditors that \nconfirm that the debts have been paid or are being paid.  In fact, there are no payment \nplan agreements from any of the creditors to show that she is adhering to them to \nresolve her debts.  At this point, Applicant states that one of the debts in the SOR has \nbeen paid off and the others remain owing.  Applicant has offered insufficient mitigation \nin response to the SOR.  Thus it cannot be determined if her debt is being resolved or is \nunder control.  Applicant has not explained if she has set up payment plans with the \ncreditors, or what those payment plans are or have been.  Mitigating conditions \u00b6 20(a) \nand (d) do not provide full mitigation in this case.  There is no clear evidence in the \nrecord that she has acted reasonably and responsibly under the circumstances.  Her \ninactions reflect unreliability, untrustworthiness, and poor judgment. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concern.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a.: through 1.i:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

Clearance is granted.   \n \nStatement of the Case\n \nOn March 15, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline I, psychological conditions, explaining why it was unable to find it \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant security clearance eligibility. The DOD \nCAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; and DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive) and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective June \n8, 2017. \n\n2 \n \nOn April 4, 2019, Applicant answered the SOR, admitting the allegations, and \nrequesting a hearing.  On June 4, 2019, the case was assigned to me. On July 16, 2019, \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing, scheduling \nApplicant\u2019s case for August 28, 2019.

(GE 4 at 53) He \nreceived treatment from the psychiatrist approximately once per week for two months until \nhe relocated with his wife to another state. In July 2014, after relocating, Applicant met with \na psychiatrist who diagnosed him with depression and anxiety. The doctor prescribed him \nantidepressants and anti-anxiety medications, and recommended that he attend \npsychotherapy. (GE 3 at 8; Tr. 19) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s symptoms continued to worsen. One day in early December 2014, while \ndriving a school bus (his job at the time), Applicant wet his pants. Embarrassed and angry \nwith himself, Applicant returned home after finishing his route, and took a shower. While in \nthe shower, he began to have suicidal thoughts. (Tr. 33) He called his psychiatrist who told \nhim to go to the hospital as soon as Applicant\u2019s wife returned home. Applicant followed his \npsychiatrist\u2019s advice. \n \n\n3 \n \n \nWhile at the hospital, Applicant was evaluated and diagnosed with major depressive \ndisorder. Subsequently, he was admitted, staying in the hospital for four days. (Tr. 34) \nUpon discharge, Applicant was prescribed another medication to supplement the ones that \nhe had already been taking.

(AE H) There was an approximate three-month gap in \ntreatment from the time Applicant\u2019s previous psychiatrist retired and the time Applicant \nbegan receiving treatment from the practice that is currently serving him. (Tr. 36) According \nto Applicant\u2019s psychiatrist, he does not currently have any psychiatric or psychological \nconditions that impair his judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. (AE H at 2) \n \n \nApplicant excels on the job, succeeding in a highly stressful environment. (GEs G, \nI - K) He has an extensive network of friends through his church where he serves as a \nworship leader, the top elected position for a layperson. (AE E at 2) Applicant continues to \nmeet with his pastor approximately once per month for counseling. (AE C) Per the pastor, \nApplicant is dependable and reliable, and has consistently demonstrated trustworthiness \nand stability. (AE C) \n \n \nOne of Applicant\u2019s friends from church is a retired military officer with significant \nexperience working with subordinates struggling with mental health issues. (AE D at 2) Per \nthe retired officer, Applicant was forthcoming with the church about his mental health \nproblems, and has the \u201cspecial trust and confidence\u201d of the pastor. (AE D at 2) In sum, he \nexpressed absolute confidence in Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness and reliability. (AE D at 2) \n \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied together with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n\n4 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive \nOrder 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;  \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions: \n \n \nUnder this guideline, \u201ccertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can \nimpair judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\u201d  (AG \u00b6 27) Applicant\u2019s diagnosis of major \n\n5 \n \ndepressive disorder, together with his suicide attempt in 2014, history of suicide ideation, \nand an inpatient psychiatric hospitalization, trigger the following disqualifying conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 28: \n \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behavior behaviors; \n \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional;  \n \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional, employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a low \nprobability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \n \n \nWith the exception of a three-month gap in treatment after Applicant\u2019s psychiatrist \nretired and the date he began receiving treatment from his current psychiatrist, Applicant \nhas consistently been receiving treatment. According to his current psychiatrist, Applicant \nhas no psychiatric or psychological problem that would impair his judgment, reliability, or \nstability. \n \n\n6 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s stint at his current employer has been successful, and he is thriving in \nhis community, as an elected church leader and teen mentor. Under these circumstances, I \nconclude that all of the mitigating conditions apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mental health condition is a serious problem that could impact his \njudgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. He is successfully controlling it through ongoing \ncounseling and psychiatric consultations. His strong work record and good character \nreferences constitute additional evidence of stability. Also, he has been forthcoming about \nhis mental illness with his family, friends, and fellow parishioners, negating any vulnerability \nto coercion. Under these circumstances, I conclude that the presence of rehabilitation \noutweighs the nature and seriousness of the problem, rendering the possibility of \nrecurrence minimal. Applicant has mitigated the security concern.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline I:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n_____________________ \nMarc E. Curry \n Administrative Judge \n",

He did not mitigate the resulting financial security concerns. National \nsecurity eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 6, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial \nConsiderations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AG), effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on March 29, 2019, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. On May 31, 2019, the Defense Office \n\n \n \n \n \n2\nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me. On August 12, 2019, DOHA \nissued a Notice of Hearing setting the case for August 14, 2019, as agreed by Applicant\u2019s \nattorney and Department Counsel. The case was heard as scheduled. Department \nCounsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7 into evidence. Applicant testified, \nand offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A: Encl.1 through Encl.10; B: Encl.1 and Encl. 2; and \nC: Encl.1 into evidence. All exhibits were admitted. DOHA received the hearing transcript \n(Tr.) on August 23, 2019. The record remained open until September 3, 2019, to give \nApplicant an opportunity to submit additional evidence. Applicant timely submitted three \nexhibits that I marked as AE D: Encl. 1 through Encl. 3, and admitted without objection. \nBoth parties proffered additional arguments in their post-hearing submissions.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted in part the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a, and denied the allegations \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c (Answer).  \n \n \nApplicant is 61 years old. He has been married three times. He was married to his \nfirst wife from 1987 to 1990 and was married to his second wife from 1992 to 2007. He \nhas been married to his third wife since 2010. He has two children from his first marriage \nand two stepchildren from his second marriage. In 1981, he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree \nand in 1997, he earned a master\u2019s degree.

After retiring \nfrom the Army, he worked for a defense contractor from 2001 to 2011. He obtained \nanother contractor position where he worked until being laid off in 2013, due to a lack of \nwork. He then started his own company and was self-employed until November 2014, \nwhen he began his current position with a defense contractor. In October 2016, he \nsubmitted a security clearance application (SCA). He held a security clearance while \nserving in the Army and continuously since retiring from the Army (Tr. 24-29, 58; GE 1, \nGE 7) Applicant worked as a part-time adjunct instructor for a local university from 2001 \nto 2007. (Tr. 64; GE 1, GE 7)  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged he was fully employed from 2006 through 2012, and then \nexperienced a year or two of unemployment and underemployment until November 2014. \nSince then, he has been gainfully employed. (Tr. 79) He reported an adjusted gross \nincome (AGI) of $173,532 for 2016. (AE A: Encl. 2) His AGI was $150,374 for 2017. (AE \nA: Encl: 3) Applicant earned $154,565 while working overseas in 2018. After excluding \n$131,176 as foreign income for purposes of paying U.S. taxes, his AGI was $43,963 for \n2018. (AE A: Encl. 4) \n \n \nApplicant owns two pieces of property in the United States. In 2007 or 2008, after \nhis divorce, he purchased a home in State 1 for $319,000. He thinks he has about \n$150,000 of equity in that home. He and his wife own a home they purchased in 2012 for \n$530,000 in State 2. It is on the market for $700,000. He has about $300,000 in equity in \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nthat home. Both houses are being rented while he and his wife reside overseas. (Tr. 30, \n60-62)  \n \n \nSince December 2017, Applicant and his wife have lived in Germany where he \nworks. His employer pays his housing costs in Germany. (Tr. 59, 62-63)  \n \nSOR (1.a) 2006 Tax Lien  \n \n \nAfter Applicant and his second wife divorced in April 2007, he obtained an \nextension of time to file his 2006 Federal income tax return to October 2007. (Tr. 31; GE \n1) He filed it in May 2008, as noted below. (AE A: Encl. 1) \n \n \n \nIn his October 2016 SCA, Applicant disclosed his unpaid 2006 Federal income tax \ndebt that totaled about $40,000. In March 2012, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed \na tax lien for $64,688. During his August 2018 interview, Applicant told an investigator \nthat he entered into an installment agreement with the IRS to pay $350 per month on the \ndebt in July 2012, around the time his income was decreasing. The agreement was \nsuspended in mid-2013 because he did not have a steady income. He explained that he \nwas subsequently apprehensive about entering into another agreement until he secured \na steady contract. He also told the investigator that the IRS had applied about $12,000 of \ntax refunds for tax years 2012 to 2015 to his 2006 tax debt. (GE 1) He stated that his tax \nliability for 2006 was about $40,000, and fees and interest were about $24,000. (GE 7)  \n \n \nThe following information is listed on the IRS account transcript of Applicant\u2019s 2006 \ntax return (AE A: Encl. 1): \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s adjusted gross income (AGI) for 2006 was $143,360.  \n \nOn November 19, 2007, the IRS sent Applicant an inquiry for \u201cnon-filing of tax \nreturn.\u201d Applicant testified he did not remember receiving this notice. (Tr. 68)  \n \nOn May 29, 2008, Applicant filed a return and it was processed on June 23, 2008. \nApplicant testified that he had to refile it and make a change to his filing status due \nto his divorce. (Tr. 65-67) \n \nOn February 16, 2009, the IRS notified Applicant that he owed an additional \n$34,948 in taxes, penalties, and interest charges related to the late filing of his \n2006 return. Applicant testified that he does not remember receiving this notice. \n(Tr. 68) \n \nOn March 7, 2010, the IRS confirmed that it received Applicant\u2019s refiled return. \nApplicant testified that he remembered refiling the return at this time. (Tr. 32-34, \n68-69) \n \nOn May 10, 2010, the IRS notified Applicant that it assessed a penalty for the late \npayment of his 2006 taxes. Applicant testified that he does not remember receiving \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nthis notice. (Tr. 68) He acknowledged that he resided at the same home from 2007 \nthrough 2010. (Tr. 70) \n \nOn April 22, 2011, the IRS noted that Applicant filed an amended tax return for \n2006.  \n \n \nApplicant testified that he did not become aware that he owed the IRS a significant \namount of money until 2011, around the time he filed the amended return. (Tr. 71) \n \nOn May 9, 2011, the IRS issued Applicant a notice about reducing or removing the \npenalties for filing late and the late payment of his 2006 taxes. \n \n \nOn June 7, 2011, the IRS issued Applicant a notice of its intent to levy.  \n \n \nOn June 15, 2011, the IRS confirmed that Applicant received the above levy notice.  \n \nOn July 16, 2011, Applicant\u2019s attorney submitted an offer in compromise to the       \nIRS to resolve the taxes.  \n \nOn March 2, 2012, the IRS rejected Applicant\u2019s offer in compromise and filed a tax \nlien for 2006 in the amount of $64,688 against Applicant. Applicant testified that \nthis tax liability arose because he underpaid his 2006 taxes while in the process of \ndivorcing. (Tr. 35, 74) \n \nOn January 4, 2013, Applicant\u2019s attorney submitted another offer in compromise \nto the IRS. It was accepted by the IRS on January 28, 2013.  \n \nOn April 28, 2014, the IRS noted that Applicant\u2019s payment agreement was no \nlonger in effect.  \n \nDuring his August 2018 interview, Applicant said he made payments on his first \ninstallment plan for several months. (GE 7) Applicant testified that he was laid off \nbetween 2013 and 2014, and stopped making payments because he could not \nafford them. (Tr. 36) \n \nOn September 15, 2014, the IRS noted that the tax balance was currently not \ncollectible. \n \nNo installment payments are recorded in the IRS\u2019 account transcript from 2012 \nthrough 2015. \n \nOn June 20, 2016, the IRS noted that the account is currently collectible. \n \nOn April 15, 2017, the IRS credited Applicant\u2019s unpaid 2006 taxes with a two-dollar \noverpayment from his 2016 taxes.   \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nOn April 15, 2018, the IRS credited Applicant\u2019s tax overpayment of $3,475 for 2017 \nto his 2006 tax liability.   \n \nOn August 15, 2018, Applicant entered a second installment agreement with the \nIRS to pay his 2006 tax debt balance of $22,654.  \n \nThe IRS\u2019 transcript recorded payments of $493 in October 2018 and $600 in \nNovember and December 2018. It also recorded payments of $1,200 from January \nthrough March 2019. Applicant presented evidence that he made payments of \n$1,200 from April through July 2019. (AE A: Encls. 1, 5, 8, 9)  \n \nIn July 2019, the IRS credited Applicant\u2019s 2018 tax overpayment of $6,354 to his \n2006 tax liability. (AE A: Encl. 7) \n \n \nOn August 9, 2019, Applicant made a $1,200 payment on his 2006 tax debt \nbalance of $3,415, leaving about $2,200 remaining unpaid. (Tr. 40-41; AE A: Encls. 9, \n10)   \n \n \nApplicant testified that the first payment he ever made to the IRS on his 2006 tax \ndebt was in October 2018, when he started the second installment payment plan. He \nclarified that he had not made payments on the initial installment agreement because he \nwas laid off soon after he negotiated it. (Tr. 71-74) He stated that he purposely did not \ntake exemptions for each year after 2012 because he wanted to create a refund that the \nIRS would credit to his 2006 unpaid taxes. His strategy was to overpay his taxes in a \ncurrent tax year and apply that overpayment to the 2006 tax liability. (Tr. 73) No tax credits \nare recorded on Applicant\u2019s 2006 IRS account transcript for tax years 2012 to 2015. (AE \nA: Encl. 1) \n \n \nDuring his August 15, 2018 interview, Applicant acknowledged that he recently \ncontacted the IRS to establish a payment plan for his 2006 tax debt in order to avoid \ndelaying his security clearance renewal. (GE 7) In fact, he and his wife signed that \ninstallment agreement with the IRS the same day as his August 2018 interview. (AE A: \nEncl. 5) While testifying, he again confirmed that this security clearance investigation \nprompted him to initiate the payment plan with the IRS to pay his $22,654 outstanding \n2006 tax debt. (Tr. 77-78)   \n \n \nApplicant stated that he was unable to pay his 2006 tax sooner because he did not \nhave enough money and could not use equity in his property to do so. He said he could \nnot obtain a home equity loan on either property he owned because his first residence \ndecreased in value while he lived there between 2007 and 2011, and his second home \ndid not increase appreciably. Additionally, his banks would not authorize a home equity \nloan for any residence that was not their primary home or being rented. (AE: D: Encl. 2) \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nSOR (1.b) 2017 State Tax Lien \n \n \nIn 2013, Applicant and his wife were notified by a state revenue agency that they \nhad an outstanding tax liability for 2012. (Tr. 81) In May 2017, the state filed an $8,106 \ntax lien for the unpaid 2012 taxes.  \n \n \nApplicant testified that he did not learn about this tax debt until he received the lien \nnotice in May 2017. Subsequently, he did not monitor resolution of the tax debt because \nhe thought his wife was addressing it through automatic deductions of $250 from her \nsalary. As a consequence, he believed he was not responsible for paying it although he \nunderstood it was a joint debt. He said that when the 2012 taxes were due in 2013, he \nwas not fully employed, but his wife was working. He presented evidence that she made \npayments from October 2017 to April 2018, at which time their bank stopped making the \nautomatic deductions, unbeknownst to her. He became aware that the taxes had not been \npaid when he received the March 6, 2019 SOR. (Tr. 44-45, 81-86; AE B: Encl. 1) On April \n9, 2019, Applicant\u2019s wife withdrew money from their savings account and paid $8,106 to \nthe state, which was the final amount due on their 2012 state taxes. (Tr. 85; GE 5) \n \nSOR (1.c) University Debt \n \n \nIn 1999, Applicant entered a doctoral program. He said he attended classes in the \nspring and fall of 2000, and then withdrew because he was transitioning out of the military \ninto civilian life. He never returned to the school. He denied that he registered for classes \nafter completing the 2000 fall semester and disputed any allegation that he attended after \n2000. According to the university, Applicant attended classes from August through \nDecember of 2001, and January through March of 2002. In January 2003, the university \nwrote off the debt. He testified that he never received a bill from the university for the \nalleged amount. Applicant stated that he has gone through the security clearance \ninvestigations twice before this proceeding as a civilian, and this debt never arose during \nan investigation. (Tr. 48-52, 87-92; GE 6)   \n \n \nAfter learning of this debt when he received the March 2019 SOR, Applicant \ncontacted the university\u2019s registrar for more information about it. He said the university \nregistrar told him that the accounting system changed over the years, which made it \ndifficult to accurately respond to his inquiry. He subsequently contacted his student loan \ncompany, which said all of his loans were paid. (Tr. 52-55) On August 21, 2019, post-\nhearing, he sent a letter and fax to the university inquiring about the debt and asking \nwhether his student loans covered it this debt. (AE D: Encl. 1)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions, which \nare useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states that an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that an adverse decision shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of \nthe applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. Financial distress can also be caused or \nexacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of \npersonnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 sets out disqualifying conditions that could potentially raise security \nconcerns. Four are potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant failed to timely pay his Federal income taxes for 2006, resulting in a tax \nlien being filed in March 2012. He failed to timely pay his state income taxes for 2012, \nresulting in a tax lien being filed in May 2017. He has an educational debt from 2001 that \nremains unresolved. The evidence establishes the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of the disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation of \nthe security concerns. AG \u00b6 20 sets out six conditions that could potentially mitigate \nfinancial security concerns under this guideline: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from \na legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control;  \n\n \n \n \n \n9\n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nIn April 2019, Applicant resolved his 2012 state tax lien. He has not fully resolved \nhis 2006 Federal tax lien. He has a large unresolved tuition debt from 2001 that he \nrecently began to investigate. His extensive delays and protracted actions in addressing \nthese matters cast doubt on his reliability and judgment. There is insufficient evidence to \nestablish mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a). \n \nApplicant did not provide credible explanations to demonstrate that his tax liens or \ntuition debt are attributable to circumstances beyond his control, or that he managed them \nresponsibly under the circumstances. He testified that he did not become aware that he \nowed a tax liability for his 2006 Federal taxes until 2011, despite filing the original tax \nreturn in 2008, a revised one in 2010, and an amended one in 2011. That debt was not \nfully resolved by the time of his hearing, almost eight years later, although he has been \nsteadily employed since November 2014, and earned significant salaries for 2016, 2017, \n2018. His 2012 state taxes also went unresolved for six years. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply.  \n \nApplicant has not participated in credit or financial counseling. He recently paid his \n2012 state tax debt, and he has almost completed payments on his 2006 Federal tax \ndebt. The alleged tuition debt remains unresolved. The evidence establishes limited \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 20(c). \n \nApplicant admitted that this security clearance investigation prompted him to \nresolve his tax debts. Although he acknowledged his unpaid 2006 Federal tax lien in his \nOctober 2016 SCA, he waited until August 2018 to establish a repayment plan with the \nIRS. Prior to that, he was relying on sporadic tax credits to pay his tax debt. He knew the \nstate filed a tax lien in May 2017 for more than $8,000 in unpaid 2012 taxes. Although \nsome payments were made on it between October 2017 and April 2018, it was not \nresolved until after he received the SOR in March 2019. He learned of an alleged \noutstanding tuition bill in March 2019. Applicant\u2019s actions with respect to the two tax debts \nover the past seven or eight years did not demonstrate a good-faith effort to responsibly \nmanage his legal obligations. The only evidence that Applicant presented to refute the \nalleged tuition debt was his testimony that he does not owe it, which does not sufficiently \ndocument a substantiated basis for disputing the debt. AG \u00b6 20 (d) and (e) were not \nestablished to provide mitigation concerning the two tax allegations or the unpaid tuition \nallegation.  \n\n \n \n \n \n10 \nApplicant submitted evidence to document his compliance with a repayment plan \nwith the IRS for his 2006 tax lien and a record of complying with it since 2018. This \nprovides limited mitigation for that allegation under AG \u00b6 20(g), given the lack of timeliness \nin consistently addressing the debt.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) \nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nmust include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is an intelligent and articulate 61-year-old man, who retired from the \nArmy in 2001 after serving over 20 years. Since then, he has worked for defense \ncontractors and, for a short period, was self-employed as a contractor. Since November \n2014, he has been steadily employed and earning a substantial salary. He has gone \nthrough the security clearance process as a soldier and a civilian. \n \nDuring the hearing, Applicant discussed his history of unpaid taxes for 2006 and \n2012. He recognized his responsibility to resolve those issues, but has not done so in a \ndependable and conscientious manner. He stated he did not learn of the 2006 tax debt \nuntil 2011, about four years after his taxes were due. He did not recall receiving notices \nfrom the IRS in June 2009 or May 2010. He had no knowledge of the 2012 state tax debt \nuntil May 2017. After he became fully employed in 2014, he did not contact the IRS to \nresume or establish payments on his debt. He disclosed his unresolved 2006 tax debt in \nhis October 2016 SCA, but waited until the date he was interviewed by the government \nin August 2018 to execute an installment agreement with the IRS. He asserted that he \nwas making payments on the tax debt through credits he received from the IRS for \n\n \n \n \n \n11 \noverpayments of taxes each year after 2012. According to the record, he received credits \nfor tax years 2016, 2017, and 2018. There are no credits in the record for the prior years \nof 2007 to 2015.  \n \nThe Federal and state governments filed tax liens in order to initiate payments of \nmonies owed. Despite those filings, Applicant did not demonstrate a prompt response to \nresolving his taxes, and instead allowed the debts to essentially languish until he learned \nhis security clearance and employment were in jeopardy. Although he asserted he could \nnot pay his 2006 tax debt between 2012 and November 2014 due to a lack of income, he \nadmitted he has been steadily employed since then. Other than testifying that he does \nnot owe his former university any money, he did not produce any tangible evidence to \nconfirm his assertion.  \n \nApplicant has not established a sufficient record of responsibly following tax laws \nand managing related financial obligations. His actions to date are not sufficient to \noutweigh his dilatory compliance with a fundamental legal obligation to responsibly \nmanage and pay his 2006 and 2012 taxes. The DOHA Appeal Board has held that, in \nregard to managing one\u2019s taxes: \n \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). ISCR Case No. 12-10933 at 3 (App. Bd. June \n29, 2016)  \n   \nThe record evidence leaves me with doubt as to Applicant\u2019s judgment and \nsuitability for a security clearance. Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising under the financial considerations guideline.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n  \n   AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c:  \n    \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n12 \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nNational security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Dorsey, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n09/26/2019\n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge: \nBased on the record in this case [Transcript (Tr.), Government exhibits (GE) 1-2, \nand hearing exhibits (HE) I-II], I grant Applicant=s clearance. \nOn 19 February 2019, the Department of Defense (DoD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline B, Foreign \nInfluence.1 Applicant timely answered the SOR, requesting a hearing before the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). DOHA assigned the case to me 7 April 2019, \nand I convened a hearing 6 June 2019. DOHA received the transcript 17 June 2019, and \nthe record closed. \n1DoD acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, effective on \n8 June 2017. \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations of the SOR. He is a 73-year-old linguist \nemployed by a defense contractor since July 2017. He was previously employed by this \nsame company from August 2011 to September 2013, when he had to take extended \nmedical leave because of a heart attack. He has not previously held a clearance, but \nunderwent counter-intelligence screenings in approximately August 2011 and August \n2017 (GE 2). During his first tenure with the company, he traveled to Afghanistan on U.S. \nGovernment business from August 2011 to May 2012, May 2012 to May 2013, and May \nto October 2013. \n \nApplicant was born in Afghanistan in March 1946. He grew up there and was \neducated there until September 1965, when he went to another university to undertake a \nmaster=s degree, which he obtained in February 1972. He returned to the same university \nin September 1974 to undertake a doctoral degree, which he obtained in March 1979. \nFrom 1972 through 2000 and again from 2002 to 2005 he worked in the Afghan Ministry \nof Education (SOR 1.c). Most of his time with the ministry was spent as a professor at a \nKabul university. Applicant and his family fled to Pakistan in 2000, when the Taliban took \nover Afghanistan. They returned, at the invitation of the new Afghan government, After \nthe U.S. invasion to overthrow the Taliban after 9//11. \n \nApplicant and his wifeCa dual citizen of Afghanistan and the U.S. residing with \nApplicantCmarried in Afghanistan in November 1979. They have two children born in \nAfghanistan: a son born in 1980 and a daughter born in 1988. Both are naturalized U.S. \ncitizens residing in the U.S. Applicant=s parents are both deceased, as are his older and \nyounger brothers, and his in-laws. Applicant has a 20-month old grandson, born in the \nU.S. \n \nApplicant=s spouse worked in the Afghan diplomatic corps. From 2002 to 2005, \nshe served in the Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Then, she was posted as the Afghan \nAmbassador to another country from 2005 to 2008 (SOR 1.a) During that time, Applicant \nwas unemployed. He volunteered to provide technical support to his wife=s office \nwhenever there was an issue with their computer systems (SOR 1.c).  \n \nRather than return to Afghanistan after his wife=s term as ambassador to another \ncountry ended in March 2008, Applicant and his wife immigrated to the U.S., on their \nAfghani diplomatic passports, without the knowledge or permission of the Afghan \ngovernment.. In April 2008, they applied for political asylum because of the political and \nmilitary situation in Afghanistan. Asylum was granted. As required by U.S. and \ninternational law, they maintained their Afghan passportsCno longer diplomatic. Applicant \napplied for U.S. citizenship in June 2014, and became a naturalized citizen in December \n2014 (GE 2). His U.S. passport was issued in January 2015, and expires in January 2025 \n(GE 1). All his Afghan passports have expired, the most recent one in June 2016, having \nbeen issued in June 2011. \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \n \nSometime between 2015 and 2017, Applicant was contacted by a named \nindividual who was then the Afghan Minister to the U.S. Applicant has been inexact at \nbest about when that contact actually occurred. Applicant=s issue is that the named \nindividual who Applicant insists made the contact was Ambassador to the U.S. from \nFebruary 2011 to February 2015 (independently verified), and the named Ambassador \nthat appears in Applicant=s August 2017 counter-intelligence investigation was \nAmbassador from September 2015 to August 2018 (independently verified) (GE 2). \nApplicant asserts that he does not know the second Ambassador, and that the first \nAmbassador reached out because he had been Applicant=s student while in college. His \nwife had also been friend=s in Afghanistan with the Ambassador=s family. Applicant and \nhis wife met with the first Ambassador at the Afghan embassy to have tea and \ncongratulate him on his appointment (SOR 1.d). Readily available information confirms \nthat the first Ambassador is closer in age to Applicant and also graduated from the same \nuniversity in Kabul where Applicant taught, while the second Ambassador is much \nyounger than Applicant, and his educational history in Afghanistan is unknown. I conclude \nthat Applicant was referring to the first Ambassador when he discussed his and his wife=s \ncontact with the current Ambassador to the U.S. In any event, Applicant had no further \ncontact with this Ambassador; although Applicant later correctly learned that this \nAmbassador later became the Afghan Ministry of Finance before stepping down in 2018 \n(independently verified). \n \nApplicant and his wife have no financial interests in Afghanistan. Applicant has no \ncontacts in Afghanistan that are not part of his official U.S. Government business. When \nhe travels to Afghanistan he never leaves the U.S. base where he is posted, and his job \nis to interview prisoners brought in for questioning. Applicant=s wife has no continuing \ncontacts in Afghanistan. She traveled to Afghanistan to visit some distant relatives on her \nfather=s side in 2015. \n \nAfghanistan \n \nThe United States Department of State=s travel warning for Afghanistan remains in \neffect and it warns U.S. citizens against travel there because of continued instability and \nthreats by terrorist organizations against U.S. citizens. Travel there is unsafe due to \nongoing risk of kidnapping, hostage-taking, military combat operations, and armed rivalry \nbetween political and tribal groups, militant attacks, suicide bombings, and insurgent \nattacks. These attacks may also target Afghan and U.S. Government convoys and \ncompounds, foreign embassies, military installations, and other public areas.  \n \nAs recently as December 2018, the U.S. Embassy in Kabul warned U.S. citizens \nin Afghanistan of reports that militants plan to conduct attacks against hotels, compounds, \ninternational organizations, universities, airports and other locations frequented by U.S. \ncitizens and other foreign nationals. \n  \nExtremists associated with various Taliban networks, the Islamic State in Iraq and \nSyria (ISIS), and members of other armed opposition groups are active throughout the \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \ncountry. These terrorist groups routinely attack Afghan, coalition forces, and U.S. targets \nwith little regard for or the express intent to cause civilian casualties. Due to security \nconcerns, unofficial travel to Afghanistan by U.S. Government employees and their family \nmembers is restricted and requires prior approval from the State Department \n.  \nAfghanistan continues to experience aggressive and coordinated attacks by \ndifferent terrorist groups. These groups remain active and were able to conduct a number \nof high-profile, mass-casualty attacks in Kabul against sectarian and Afghan government \ntargets. They continue to plan such attacks against U.S. and coalition forces and Afghan \ninterests. Border regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan remain safe havens for terrorists. \nThe Afghan government struggles to assert control over this remote region.  \n \nAccording to a June 2017 U.S. Department of Defense report on Afghanistan, \nAfghanistan faces a continuing threat from as many as 20 insurgent and terrorist networks \npresent and operating in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, in what is the highest \nconcentration of extremist and terrorist groups in the world.   \n \nThe State Department=s report on human rights for Afghanistan notes there was \nwidespread violence, including indiscriminate attacks on civilians and killings of persons \naffiliated with the government by armed insurgent groups, widespread disregard for the \nrule of law, and little accountability for those who committed human rights abuses. There \nwas also targeted violence and endemic societal discrimination against women and girls. \n  \n \nAfghanistan remains an important partner of the United States in the fight against \nterrorism, working with the U.S. to eliminate terrorist groups. The U.S. Government \ncontinues to invest resources to help Afghanistan improve its security, governance, \ninstitutions, and economy. The U.S. Government has a strong bilateral partnership with \nthe Afghan government. \n \n \nPolicies \n \nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person=s suitability for \naccess to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented. \nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG & 2(a). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself, \nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the \nrelevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline B (Foreign Influence). \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant=s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does,  \nthe burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government=s case. \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden \nof persuasion. \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. \nThe Aclearly consistent with the national interest@ standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant=s suitability for access in favor of the government. \nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n \nAnalysis \n \nUnder Guideline B (Foreign Influence), an applicant=s foreign contacts and \ninterests may raise security concerns if the individual 1) has divided loyalties or foreign \nfinancial interests, 2) may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way contrary to U.S. interests, or 3) is vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Foreign influence adjudications can and \nshould consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial \ninterest is locatedCincluding, but not limited to, whether the country is known to target \nU.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism \n(AG & 6). \n \nEvaluation of an individual=s qualifications for access to protected information \nrequires careful assessment of both the foreign entity=s willingness and ability to target \nprotected information, and to target ex-patriots who are U.S. citizens to obtain that \ninformation, and the individual=s susceptibility to influence, whether negative or positive. \nMore specifically, an individual=s contacts with foreign family members (or other foreign \nentities or persons) raise security concerns only if those contacts create a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion [AG & 7(a)]. In \naddition, security concerns may be raised by a substantial business, financial, or property \ninterest in a foreign country, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which \ncould subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation [AG & \n7(e)]. \n \nIn this case, the Government failed to establish a case for disqualification under \nGuideline B. Considering first the country involved, on balance Afghanistan and the U.S. \nenjoy good foreign relations. It has not been demonstrated that the Afghan government \nis actively engaged in the collection of U.S. intelligence which would make Applicant or \nhis family likely targets for coercion, duress, or influence. The Government=s evidence \nexplains the links to terrorism that are ongoing in Afghanistan and the way that those \nterrorist organizations operate, the increase in terrorism, and the increase in membership \nin terrorist groups. Several of the groups that are frequently in the news, for example the \nTaliban and Al Qa=ida, operate in Afghanistan and practice terrorist acts against Afghan \nand U.S. forces as well as indiscriminate violence in order to draw attention to themselves \nand increase their membership and their power. There is no indication they use terrorism \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nto gain access to U.S. information. Moreover, there is nothing in Afghanistan that could \nbe used as a point of leverage on Applicant, whether the Afghan government or terrorists. \n \nConsidering Applicant=s circumstances, the Government produced no evidence \nthat there was a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion because of Applicant=s contacts in Afghanistan, because there are \nnone. Consider SOR 1.d: Sometime between 2015 and 2017, Applicant and his wife met \nonce with a former student of Applicant and a family connection of his wife, to have tea \nwhile congratulating the former student and family connection on his appointment as \nAmbassador to the U.S. They have had no contact with him since. Consider SOR 1.b: \nApplicant helped around his wife=s office as a volunteer from 2005 to 2008, and the two \nof them came to the U.S. rather than return to Afghanistan, ending their joint connection \nto Afghanistan. Alleged this way, it is almost laughable. No U.S. policy requires Applicant \nto disassociate himself from his wife, even if she was an Afghan Ambassador. If anything, \nApplicant and his wife would appear to be good potential intelligence sources for U.S. \ninterests. Moreover, Applicant experienced no difficulty renewing his Afghan passport in \nJune 2011, as required of all legal permanent residents of the U.S. His wife apparently \nexperienced no difficulty, as she has actually returned to Afghanistan \n \nSimilarly, there are no connections that might raise any potential conflict of interest. \nHe owes no obligation to any Afghan person or entity. Further, he has been in the U.S. \nmore than 10 years. His wife and children are here, as is his young grandchild. All his \nfinancial interests are here. Consider: Applicant and his family were vetted before they \nwere granted asylum in 2008. Except for the visit with the former student, all the SOR \nallegations were at issue in this vetting. Again, all these issues were vetted in 2011, when \nhis favorable counter-intelligence screening allowed him to travel for his current employer \nmultiple times to Afghanistan to perform Government-contract work. Finally, Applicant \nhas served with U.S. forces in Afghanistan, producing the classified intelligence for those \nforces and protecting U.S. interests, even without a clearance.2 Essentially, he is the \nsource of the information to be protected. There is no interest in Afghanistan for Applicant \nto choose between over those of the U.S. [AG & 8(a)].  None of the other disqualifying \nconditions are implicated by the facts in this case. Under these circumstances, I conclude \nthat it is unlikely Applicant can be pressured based on hisCor his wife=sCpast involvement \nin Afghanistan. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline B for Applicant. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nParagraph 1. Guideline B: FOR APPLICANT  \n \n \n \nSubparagraph a-d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n                                                 \n2A factor the Appeal Board has regularly acknowledged as a legitimate factor for consideration in Guideline \nB cases.

Henderson, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n08/09/2019 \n______________ \n \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nBENSON, Pamela C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied.  \n \n \n \n \n         Statement of the Case \n \n \n \nOn November 7, 2018, Applicant submitted a security clearance application \n(SCA). On March 4, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal \nConduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \nAccess to Classified Information, effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 14, 2019, and he admitted all of the SOR \nallegations. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.q, and 2.a.) Applicant did not attach any supporting \n\n \n2 \n \n \ndocumentation with his response. He requested that his case be decided by an \nadministrative judge on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On April 9, 2019, \nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case. A complete copy of the \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM), containing nine Items, was mailed to Applicant on \nApril 12, 2019. The FORM notified Applicant that he had an opportunity to file objections \nand submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt \nof the FORM. Applicant did not provide a response to the FORM or object to \nGovernment Items 1 through 9, which were admitted into evidence. The DOHA Office \nassigned the case to me on June 20, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 34 years old and employed by a DOD contractor as an aircraft \nmechanic since April 2018. He served in the U.S. Air Force from June 2003 to May \n2009, when he was involuntarily separated from active duty due to personnel \nreductions. He married in 2006 and has six children, ages 1, 3, 4, 6, 9 and 11. He listed \non his SCA that he was granted a DOD security clearance while he was active duty in \nthe U.S. Air Force, but he does not currently possess a DOD security clearance. (Item \n3) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has 16 delinquent accounts totaling \napproximately $30,000. In 2013, he was arrested for 4th degree theft, and false reporting \nof information to police. He was convicted of false reporting of information to police. The \ndebts alleged in the SOR are supported by the admitted credit bureau reports. \nApplicant\u2019s 2013 arrest and conviction were supported by his admission during his \nOctober 2016 background interview, the police records, and the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigations criminal history report. (Items 1-9) \n \n \nIn July 2013, Applicant was charged with criminal conduct after he stole $3,488 \nfrom his employer, and then fabricated a story to police that he had been kidnapped at \ngunpoint. He was employed as a general manager at a fast-food restaurant for just over \nthree years. He stated that he was feeling stressed while driving to the bank to make a \ncash deposit for his employer. He claimed to have suffered an acute psychotic break, \ndrove past the bank, and continued driving for another four hours. He believed there \nwas another person in his car with a weapon. He eventually woke up from his trance \nabout four hours later. He drove another four hours on his way home and found the \npolice waiting for him at his residence. The deposit bag was still in his car, which he \nreturned, but his employer stated that $274 was missing from the daily sales cash \nregister and petty cash. Applicant made restitution to his employer and the theft charge \nwas dismissed. In his SOR response, he wrote; \u201cWith this charge I was never convicted \nof this crime. Money had gone missing after an episode that I was involved in and I was \nasked to pay it back and not be convicted.\u201d Applicant pled guilty to making a false report \nto law enforcement, paid a fine of $315, and served two days in jail. (Items 2, 3, 7-9) \n \nApplicant failed to provide any information about how he came to experience \nfinancial difficulties, or what he has done, or is doing, to resolve his outstanding financial \n\n \n3 \n \n \nobligations. Department Counsel\u2019s brief clearly addressed Applicant\u2019s responsibility to \nmitigate the financial security concerns alleged in the SOR, and his SOR response was \ninsufficient to meet this burden. Applicant received the FORM on April 19, 2019, and \nhad 30 days to present evidence of refutation, extension, or mitigation, sufficient to \novercome the prima facie case established against him. Applicant failed to provide any \ninformation within the 30-day period. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 an \u201capplicant is responsible \nfor presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing \ndeceptive loan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust.    \n \n \nApplicant has approximately $30,000 of accumulated debt alleged in the SOR. In \nJuly 2013, he was arrested after he stole money from his employer and then fabricated \na story to police that he had been kidnapped at gunpoint. The above disqualifying \nconditions apply. \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. There is insufficient evidence to show \nthat Applicant\u2019s financial problems occurred under such unusual circumstances and are \nunlikely to recur, or that the conditions which caused his financial difficulties were due to \ncircumstances beyond his control. There is no evidence to show that he is receiving, or \nhas received, financial counseling from a credible source, or that there are clear \nindications that the financial problem is being resolved or is under control. There is no \ndocumentation in the record to show if Applicant has initiated or is adhering to a good-\nfaith effort to repay his overdue creditors. \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012).  \n \n \nAs a general manager of a fast-food restaurant, it is clear that Applicant was \nplaced in a position of trust by his employer. He violated that trust by taking money from \nhis employer. His explanation that he suffered an acute psychotic episode is not \ncredible. After a thorough investigation the police charged him with providing false \ninformation to a law enforcement agency. The theft charge was dismissed only after \nApplicant made restitution to his employer, not because there was no legal basis for the \ncharge. Applicant was convicted of providing false information to the police, which \nclearly shows that he is untrustworthy and unreliable. \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct:  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable under the established facts in this \ncase: \n \n(d) credible adverse information this is not explicitly covered under other \nguidelines and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, \nbut which, when combined with all available information, supports a \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This included, but is \nnot limited to, consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior. . . .; and \n \n(2) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s arrest in 2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.q) was addressed under Guideline F, and \nwas cross-alleged (SOR \u00b6 2.a) under the personal conduct guideline. I have previously \naddressed the issue under Guideline F. Applicant\u2019s criminal actions show that he in \nuntrustworthy and unreliable, and his conduct clearly demonstrated dishonesty and rule \nviolations. Disqualifying conditions \u00b6\u00b616 (d)(1) and (2) apply in this case. \n \n \n \n \n \n  Whole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n7 \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \n \nApplicant failed to provide evidence of mitigation regarding his financial \nconsiderations and personal conduct security concerns. The circumstances surrounding \nhis 2013 arrest demonstrate that he is capable of breaching the trust of his employer, \nwhich makes him an unsuitable candidate for being placed in a position of trust with the \nGovernment. The record evidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s good \njudgment, reliability as well as eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Because \nprotection of the national interest is the principle focus of these adjudications, any \nunresolved doubts must be resolved against the granting of eligibility to classified \ninformation.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a -1.q: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant national security eligibility to \nApplicant. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n               \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR, however allegation 1.b. was withdrawn by the Government. (TR at page 37 line 2 to page 38 line 17.)

The record was left open until \nSeptember 9, 2019, for receipt of additional documentation. On September 9, 2019, \nApplicant submitted documents, which I marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AppX) A and \n\n \n2 \n \nadmitted into evidence. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on July 22, \n2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR, however allegation 1.b. was \nwithdrawn by the Government. (TR at page 37 line 2 to page 38 line 17.)  After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 62-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (TR at page 13 line \n24 to page 15 line 5, and GX 1 at page 5.) He has been employed with the defense \ncontractor for about \u201cone and a half years.\u201d Applicant retired from the U.S. Navy after 20 \nyears of honorable service. (TR at page 12 line 23 to page 13 line 21.) He has held a \nsecurity clearance, on and off, since about 1982. (TR at page 14 lines 11~15.) He is \nmarried, and attributes much of the alleged medical debt to his wife having \u201cBreast \nCancer and . . . severe Asthma.\u201d (TR at page 18 line 21 to page 20 line 17.) However, \ndespite the admitted past-due indebtedness, Applicant took \u201cout $12,000.00 out of . . . \n[his] 401K that . . . [he] spent . . . from March through April [of this year] on various \nthings [a brand new stereo system]\u201d and \u201ca vacation in June [of this year].\u201d (TR at page \n33 line 11 to page 34 line 23.) \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \n1.a. Applicant admits that he owes Creditor A about $62,032 for past-due school \nloans. He avers that he is making monthly payments of $416 towards this admitted \ndebt; but despite having two months to do so, Applicant has submitted nothing in \nsupport of this averment. (TR at page 23 line 20 to page 27 line 8.) This allegation is \nfound against Applicant. \n \n \n1.b. As noted above, this allegation was withdrawn by the Government. \n \n \n1.c. and 1.o. Applicant admits that he owes Creditor C about $312 for past-due \nmedical debts, but has submitted nothing further in this regard. These allegations are \nfound against Applicant. \n \n \n1.d.  Applicant admits that he owes Creditor D about $60 for a past-due medical \ndebt, but has submitted nothing further in this regard. This allegation is found against \nApplicant. \n \n \n1.e.  Applicant admits that he owes Creditor E about $365 for a past-due medical \ndebt, but has submitted nothing further in this regard. This allegation is found against \nApplicant. \n \n \n1.f.~1.l. Applicant admits that he owes Creditor F about $2,612 for past-due \nmedical debts. He avers that he is making monthly payments of $250 towards this \nadmitted debt; but despite having two months to do so, Applicant has submitted nothing \n\n \n3 \n \nin support of this averment.  (TR at page 27 line 9 to page 28 line 15.) These allegations \nare found against Applicant. \n \n \n1.m. Applicant admits that he owes Creditor M about $182 for a past-due medical \ndebt, but has submitted nothing further in this regard. This allegation is found against \nApplicant. \n \n \n1.n. Applicant admits that he owes Creditor N about $92 for a past-due medical \ndebt, but has submitted nothing further in this regard. (TR at page 22 lines 1~20.) This \nallegation is found against Applicant. \n \n \n1.o. This allegation has already been discussed, above. \n \n \n1.p. Applicant admits that he owes Creditor P about $339 for a past-due medical \ndebt, but has submitted nothing further in this regard. This allegation is found against \nApplicant. \n \n \n1.q. Applicant admits that he owes Creditor Q about $287 for a past-due medical \ndebt, but has submitted nothing further in this regard. (TR at page 22 lines 1~7.) This \nallegation is found against Applicant. \n \n \n1.r. Applicant admits that he owes Creditor R about $453 for a past-due medical \ndebt, but has submitted nothing further in this regard. This allegation is found against \nApplicant. \n \n \n1.s. Applicant admits that he owes Creditor S about $339 for a past-due debt, but \nhas submitted nothing further in this regard. (TR at page 22 lines 1~7, and at page 23 \nline 8~16.) This allegation is found against Applicant.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n\n \n5 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Four are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(e) consistent spending beyond one's means or frivolous or irresponsible \nspending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other \nnegative financial indicators. \n \n  \nApplicant has significant past-due indebtedness, yet recently spent $12,000 on a \nnew stereo system and a vacation. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying \nconditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. He has a long history of \ndelinquencies. He has done little to address his delinquencies. He has not \ndemonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has \nnot been established. Financial Considerations is found against Applicant. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial \nConsiderations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nWithdrawn \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c.~1.s.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The evidence is sufficient to raise these \ndisqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n\n \n5 \n \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. She has only most recently filed for \nthe protection of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. She has not demonstrated that future financial \nproblems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has not been established. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.

Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on February 22, 2018. \nOn February 15, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuidelines H and E. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nimplemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 21, 2019, and requested a decision on the \nrecord without a hearing. On April 16, 2019, the Government sent a complete copy of its \nwritten case, a file of relevant material (FORM) including documents identified as Items 1 \nthrough 4, to Applicant. He was given an opportunity to submit a documentary response \nsetting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation to the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on April 25, 2019, and did not respond. \n\n \n2 \n \nItems 1 and 2 are the pleadings in the case. Items 3 and 4 are admitted into evidence. \nThe case was assigned to me on June 21, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nUnless otherwise indicated by citation to another part of the record, I have \nextracted these findings of fact from Applicant\u2019s SOR answer (Item 2) and his SCA (Item \n3).  \n \nApplicant, age 36, is divorced and has no children. He was married from July 2015 \nthrough March 2017. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2010. He has been employed \nas a project manager by a federal contractor since 2011. This is his first application for a \nsecurity clearance. \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant\u2019s marijuana use \u201cwith varying frequency\u201d from \napproximately November 2003 through April 2018, and his subsequent lack of candor \nabout that use in response to DOHA Interrogatories. In his SOR answer, Applicant \nadmitted the alleged marijuana use but denied any intentional dishonesty about his use. \n \nIn his February 2018 SCA, Applicant certified the following facts concerning his \nmarijuana use: (1) First use was approximately November 2003; (2) Most recent use was \nMarch 2016; (3) As to the frequency of use, he stated \u201cHonestly, not sure. I have tried it \nmaybe 5-10 times in about 15 years. Definitely only thrice since Fall of 2006;\u201d and (4) \nApplicant declared that he had no intent to use in the future, with the following explanation: \n\u201cToo scared that I am still allergic to it and I do not enjoy the experience.\u201d (Item 3 at 29-\n31). \n \nDuring a February 2018 subject interview (SI) with a DOD authorized investigator, \nApplicant disclosed the following facts concerning his marijuana use: (1) Used one time \nat a beach house with friends in April 2018 after completion of the SCA; (2) April 2018 \nuse occurred because Applicant \u201cwas curious of the effects and wanted to see if it would \nmake [him] sick or not;\u201d (3) Motivation of April 2018 use was \u201ccuriosity;\u201d and (4) Applicant \nsocialized or associated with individuals who use drugs illegally \u201ctwo or three times a \nyear.\u201d (Item 4 at 7-8). \n \nThe investigator\u2019s written summary of the SI (SI Summary) does not explicitly state \nthat Applicant discussed any other marijuana use. Before the facts and circumstances of \nthe April 2018 use, the SI Summary\u2019s \u201cDrug Involvement\u201d section opened with the \nfollowing sentence: \u201cSubject has developed drug involvement with marijuana.\u201d In the SI \nSummary\u2019s \u201cAdditional Information\u201d section included the following sentence: \u201cAll other \ninformation discussed with Subject, to include coverage of the adjudicative guidelines, \nwas consistent with the security questionnaire.\u201d \n \nIn February 2019, DOHA propounded upon Applicant questions (Interrogatories) \nconcerning his drug involvement that were prompted by information obtained by a DOD \nauthorized investigator during the investigations process, including the SI. Applicant \ncertified the accuracy, without amendment, of that portion of the SI Summary concerning \n\n \n3 \n \nhis marijuana use. He answered \u201cyes\u201d to the question of whether he had \u201cEVER used \nillegally any drugs or controlled substances\u201d and provided the following handwritten facts \nabout that use: (1) Used marijuana one time in March 2016 and one time in April 2018; \n(2) April 2018 use was \u201cas described\u201d in the SI; (3) March 2016 use was during a bachelor \nparty where he \u201ctried [it] once from a friend with no results;\u201d and (4) Did not intend to use \nmarijuana in the future. (Item 4 at 4). \n \nIn his March 2019 SOR answer, Applicant stated the following: \u201cI fear that it was \nmy drive to be as precise, accurate, and as literal as possible that has led us to this point.\u201d \nHe asserted that he has not used marijuana since April 2018 and, since that time, has \n\u201ceither cut back completely or drastically decreased\u201d his interactions with individuals \ninvolved with drug use. He also included a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, including an acknowledgment that \u201cany future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.\u201d  \n \nWith respect to the Interrogatory response at issue in the SOR, Applicant claimed \nthe following: (1) He tried to be \u201cas accurate and literal as possible to avoid further SORs, \nconfusion, and issues;\u201d (2) His response was \u201caccurate per [his] interpretation of the \nquestion;\u201d (3) He interpreted the question to ask whether he was \u201cbreaking any U.S. laws;\u201d \n(4) He did not include the uses prior to April 2018 because they \u201chad occurred overseas \nand not on U.S. soil;\u201d (5) He was not \u201ctrying to be dishonest or deceitful\u201d through his \nomission of uses prior to April 2018; (6) He knew that investigators had access to his SCA \nwhich included the prior uses so it would make \u201cno sense for [him] to contradict [himself] \nintentionally or in a falsifying manner;\u201d (7) His intent is \u201cgenuine and honest\u201d and he is \n\u201cnot trying to hide anything;\u201d and (8) This is \u201csimply a case of a misunderstanding while \ntrying to provide the most accurate and literal responses that I can.\u201d \n \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant described his importance to the project that requires \nhim to maintain a security clearance. He stated that it would be \u201ca great honor and \nprivilege\u201d to be granted a security clearance so that he would be able to follow through \non his commitment to that project. \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2). \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \n\n \n4 \n \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. (ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, 1993 WL \n545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying \ncondition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of \nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the \nGovernment. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)). \n \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)). \n \nAnalysis \n \n \n \nGuideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24:  \n\u201cThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \n\n \n5 \n \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.\u201d  \n \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use establishes the following disqualifying condition under \nthis guideline: AG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition). \n \nNeither of the following potentially applicable mitigating conditions under this \nguideline are established: \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n \nApplicant recently used marijuana, at age 35 and after he completed his SCA \n(wherein he declared an intent not to resume the marijuana use that reportedly ended in \nMarch 2016). A sufficient pattern of abstinence has not been established nor can I \nunequivocally conclude that Applicant\u2019s marijuana use is not likely to recur. The signed \nstatement of intent that Applicant provided in his SOR answer cannot alone mitigate these \nconcerns. I have significant doubt about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \n \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n\n \n6 \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \n \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use and his lack of candor about it in his responses to \nDOHA\u2019s Interrogatories renders the general concerns involving questionable judgment \nand unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations potentially applicable. His lack of \ncandor also renders the following specific disqualifying condition under this guideline \npotentially applicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the Government has \nthe burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove a deliberate \nfalsification. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to \ndetermine an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. (ISCR Case No. 03-\n09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). An applicant\u2019s level of education and business \nexperience are relevant to determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information \non a security clearance application was deliberate. (ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. \nSep. 9, 2010). \n \nApplicant\u2019s various explanations and excuses for failing to report the entire history \nof his marijuana use in his responses to DOHA Interrogatories undermines his credibility. \nAlthough I cannot conclude based on the existing record that he intentionally omitted \ninformation about his marijuana use during his SI, Applicant has quibbled over details \nabout his marijuana use at other stages of the security investigations process in an \napparent attempt to justify his lack of candor about information that is particularly material \nand relevant to the investigatory process. That quibbling further damaged his credibility. \nApplicant is college educated, has been married, and has worked for a federal contractor \nfor over seven years. I find substantial evidence of an intent on the part of the Applicant \nto omit security-significant facts from his responses to DOHA Interrogatories. Therefore, \nAG \u00b6 16(a) is established.  \n \nThe security clearance investigation is not a forum for an applicant to split \nhairs or parse the truth narrowly. The Federal Government has a compelling \n\n \n7 \n \ninterest in protecting and safeguarding classified information. That \ncompelling interest includes the government's legitimate interest in being \nable to make sound decisions (based on complete and accurate \ninformation) about who will be granted access to classified information. An \napplicant who deliberately fails to give full, frank, and candid answers to the \ngovernment in connection with a security clearance investigation or \nadjudication interferes with the integrity of the industrial security program. \n(ISCR Case No. 01-03132 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2002). \n \nNeither of the potentially applicable mitigating conditions under this guideline \napplies: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment).  \n \nIncorporating my comments under Guideline H and in this Guideline above, I \nconclude that Applicant\u2019s marijuana use and his subsequent lack of candor about it \ncontinues to cast doubt on his good judgment and willingness to comply with rules and \nregulations.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nfollowing guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H and E in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines H and E, and evaluating all the evidence in \n\n \n8 \n \nthe context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated security \nconcerns raised by his recent marijuana use and his lack of candor about the history of \nhis marijuana use during the security clearance investigations process. Accordingly, \nApplicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b:  \nAgainst Applicant  \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Eligibility for assignment to a public trust \nposition is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted an application for public trust eligibility on February 6, 2017. \nOn January 24, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of \nReasons (SOR), citing trustworthiness concerns under Guidelines F and E. DOD acted \nunder DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); DOD Manual 5200.02, Procedures \nfor the DoD Personnel Security Program (PSP), (April 3, 2017) (Manual); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016), for all adjudicative \ndecisions on or after June 8, 2017.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 4, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on March 6, \n2019, and the case was assigned to me on April 4, 2019. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent Applicant a notice of hearing on April 17, 2019, \n\n2 \n \nscheduling the hearing for May 30, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) 1 through 7, which were \nadmitted without objection. I kept the record open until June 14, 2019, to enable him to \nsubmit additional documentary evidence. He timely submitted AX 8 through 12, which \nwere admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on June 10, 2019. \n(The transcript erroneously reflects that AX 5 consists of 11 pages. It should reflect that \nit consists of six pages.) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 63-year-old program analyst employed by a defense contractor \nsince December 2016. He has worked for federal contractors since May 2009, and he \nhas been a self-employed consultant since October 2005.  \n \n \nApplicant married in June 1988 and has two adult children. He obtained a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in January 1979, a master\u2019s degree in December 1989, and a second \nmaster\u2019s degree in August 1993. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from April \n1979 to January 2000 and retired as a lieutenant colonel. While he was on active duty, \nhe was a healthcare administrator. (Tr. 32.) He currently serves as a subject-matter \nexpert on resource sharing between governmental agencies on health care for \nveterans. (Tr. 48.) He has applied for and received eligibility for public trust positions \nseveral times. He held a security clearance and eligibility for access to sensitive \ncompartmented information while on active duty. \n \n \nThe SOR alleges a single delinquent debt, which is a credit-card account \ncharged off by the issuing bank for $30,625. Applicant opened the account in February \n2000 but rarely used it. (GX 3 at 5; Tr. 25.) In 2009-2010, he incurred a substantial \nfederal income-tax debt when he incorrectly estimated his tax liability as a self-\nemployed subcontractor. He used the credit card to make two payments of past-due \nfederal income taxes in 2011 and 2012, and he began making monthly payments on the \ncredit-card account, which were about $1,000 per month. He closed the account in 2015 \nafter his account was repeatedly hacked, but he continued to make payments on the \nbalance due. (Tr. 27.) When he was interviewed during his background investigation in \nMay 2018, he admitted that he owed the amount claimed by the bank. (GX 2 at 5.) At \nthe hearing, he testified that all the fraudulent charges on the account had been \nresolved, and he believed he owed the bank about $26,000 or $27,000. (Tr. 33-34.) He \ndid not submit any documentation of the basis for his computation. \n \n \nIn 2013, Applicant refinanced his home to obtain a lower interest rate, and his \nlender suggested that he hire a debt-management company to lower his payments on \nthe credit-card account. In October 2013, he hired Company A. (AX 1.) Company A \nadvised Applicant to stop making payments to the bank and start making payments to \nthem. Company A offered payments of about $503 for 42 months instead of the $1,000 \nper month that Applicant was paying the bank. (AX 8; Tr. 49.) \n \n\n3 \n \n \nApplicant received several delinquency notices from the bank, which he \nforwarded to Company A. He contacted Company A, and a representative informed him \nthat the company intended to accumulate more funds before starting to pay the bank. \n(Tr. 28.) The bank charged off the account in December 2013. (GX 3 at 6.) \n \n \nApplicant made payments to Company A from November 2013 to July 2015. In \nAugust 2015, he was notified that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau had filed \nan action against Company A for defrauding its customers by converting funds to its \nown use instead of paying the customers\u2019 debts. A federal district court appointed a \nreceiver, and the assets of Company A were liquidated. Applicant had paid $9,934 to \nCompany A, and he received a settlement of $5,404. (AX 8-12.) \n \n \nApplicant did not submit any evidence that he contacted the bank directly or \nmade any effort to resolve the debt after Company A was liquidated. On January 3, \n2019, shortly before receiving the SOR, Applicant hired Company B to help him resolve \nthe credit-card debt. (AX 3.) With Company B\u2019s assistance, Applicant contacted the \nbank in February 2019 and again in March 2019, requesting the bank to validate the \ndebt. The bank responded, continuing its claim that the amount owed was $30,625. (AX \n6; AX 7.) Company B sent additional letters to the bank in May 2019. Copies of the May \n2019 letters are not included in the record. (AX 5 at 2.) Applicant testified that Company \nB anticipates it will take 6 to 18 months to resolve the debt. (Tr. 36.) He testified that if \nthe debt is not resolved by July 2020, he will negotiate directly with the bank and either \npay the entire $30,625 claimed by the bank or any lesser amount that can be \nnegotiated. (Tr. 37, 52.) He currently has about $26,000 in his bank account that he has \nearmarked for payment of the debt. (AX 9.) \n \n \nApplicant is financially secure. His current annual income is about $194,000, plus \nhis military retired pay of about $42,000 after taxes. His wife earns about $45,000 per \nyear. Their two children are self-sufficient. (Tr. 39-42.) \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his applicant for a public trust position in February \n2017, he answered \u201cNo\u201d to questions whether, during the last seven years, he had \ndefaulted on any type of loan; had any bills or debts turned over to a collection agency; \nhad any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as \nagreed; or had been more than 120 days delinquent on any debt. He also answered \n\u201cNo\u201d to a question whether he was currently more than 120 days delinquent on any \ndebt.  \n \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in May 2018, the \ninvestigator confronted him with a credit report reflecting that the credit-card account \nhad been charged off, and Applicant explained why it had not been resolved. (GX 2 at \n4-5.) In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR and at the hearing, he stated that he did not \nbelieve the debt was delinquent because he had been making payments on it and \nbecause the amount of the debt was disputed. He testified that he had never before \nbeen in a situation where he was paying one company to pay off a debt with another \ncompany while amount of the debt was in dispute. He had not seen his credit report \nbefore he was interviewed in May 2018, and he was unaware that the bank had \n\n4 \n \ncharged off the debt. He admitted that he struggled with the answers to the financial \nquestions in his application, but he persuaded himself that negative answers were \ncorrect. (Tr. 52-54.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe Manual covers sensitive positions, but it does not include specific provisions \nfor ADP cases. ADP cases continue to be adjudicated in accordance with the Deputy \nUnder Secretary of Defense\u2019s Memorandum for the Director, Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals, dated November 19, 2004.The Under Secretary of Defense\u2019s \nMemorandum treats ADP positions as sensitive positions, and it entitles applicants for \nADP positions to the procedural protections in the Directive before any final unfavorable \naccess determination may be made. The standard set out in the Manual and the \nadjudicative guidelines for assignment to sensitive duties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, \nreliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning the person to sensitive duties is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security. AG \u00b6 2.b.   \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may \ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d The Government must present \nsubstantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.14. Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue \neligibility for access to sensitive information.  \n \n\n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nFinancial Considerations \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant is indebted to a bank on an account that has \nbeen charged off for $30,625. The concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to raise money. It encompasses \nconcerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to \nprotecting classified or sensitive information. A person who is financially irresponsible \nmay also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding \nclassified or sensitive information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the record establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and \nAG \u00b6 19(b) (\u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d). The debt \nalleged in the SOR initially arose because Applicant was unable to pay it in full. He now \nhas the means to pay it but is hoping to settle it for less than the full amount claimed. \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d) is not established because \nonly a single debt is involved.  \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \n\n6 \n \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s indebtedness was infrequent, but \nit is recent and did not occur under circumstances making it unlikely to recur. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Company A\u2019s fraud was a condition beyond \nApplicant\u2019s control. However, he did not act responsibly after discovering the fraud. He \ntook no action to resolve the debt between August 2015, when he was notified of the \nfraud, and January 2019, when he hired another debt-management company. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. The debt-management advice Applicant has \nreceived does not constitute financial counseling within the meaning of this mitigating \ncondition, and the debt is not resolved. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant has not reached an agreement with the \ncreditor and has not tendered any payments on the debt. A promise to pay a delinquent \ndebt in the future is not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely \nmanner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008). \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant disputes the amount of the debt, but he \nadmitted that the bank resolved all the fraudulent transactions after his account was \nhacked. At the hearing, he conceded that he might owe $26,000 or $27,000. He \nsubmitted no documentation of the basis for his computations. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant falsified his application for a public trust position \nby answering \u201cNo\u201d to all questions about delinquent debts and failing to disclose the \ndelinquent debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. The concern under this guideline is set out in AG \n\u00b6 15:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \n\n7 \n \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition is AG \u00b6 16(a): \u201cdeliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations . . . [or] \ndetermine national security eligibility or trustworthiness . . . .\u201d When a falsification \nallegation is controverted, as in this case, the Government has the burden of proving it. \nAn omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An administrative judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the \ntime of the omission. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). An \napplicant\u2019s experience and level of education are relevant to determining whether a \nfailure to disclose relevant information on a security clearance application was \ndeliberate. ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). \n \n \nApplicant financial naivet\u00e9 is somewhat surprising in light of his extensive formal \neducation, administrative background, and previous experience with the adjudicative \nprocess for public trust positions. He was negligent in failing to check his credit record, \nseek advice from a security manager, or at least explain his uncertainty about the status \nof the debt in his application. However, his negligence and naivet\u00e9 fall short of \nintentional falsification. I conclude that the AG \u00b6 16(a) is not established. No other \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline are established.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \npublic trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant has the financial \nmeans to resolve the debt but is waiting for his debt-management company to resolve it \nfor him. He has not adequately explained why he needs another year to resolve it. Once \nthe debt is resolved, his eligibility for a public trust position may warrant reconsideration. \nSee Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.37 through E3.1.39 (reconsideration authorized after one year). \nHowever, based on the record before me, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \ntrustworthiness concerns raised by his indebtedness. After weighing the disqualifying \n\n8 \n \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and E, and evaluating all the evidence in \nthe context of the whole person, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing \nthat it is clearly consistent with national security to continue his eligibility for a public \ntrust position. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ncontinue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of the February 6, 2019 SOR, Applicant owed a $445 wireless phone debt in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and charged-off student loans of $9,102 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and $19,552 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). When Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, she explained that she had been unaware of the wireless phone debt before the SOR, but she has since paid it. She acknowledged the defaulted student loans, which she obtained as a minor, and indicated that they have been taken on by her co-signer. (Item 1.) After considering the FORM, which includes Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 35-year-old defense-contractor employee seeking a DOD security clearance. She has been working for her current employer as a contract administrator since June 2014. Applicant was divorced in September 2015, after ten years of marriage. She has two sons, ages 12 and 16. From July 2008 to March 2015, she resided with her parents and then with her older sister, so she and her ex-husband may have been separated well before their divorce, although it is unclear. (Item 2.) Applicant pursued her undergraduate studies on and off from 2001 to May 2016, when she earned her bachelor\u2019s degree. She obtained approximately $72,000 in student loans. Two of the loans, obtained for $4,500 in January 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and $10,000 in September 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), were co-signed.

Those student loans have been dropped from \nher credit report, but she provided no evidence of any payments toward their delinquent \nbalances totaling more than $28,000. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn February 6, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant,1 detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR explained why the DOD \nCAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for her. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \n                                                 \n1 The SOR was issued to Applicant under her maiden name, as shown in the caption, even though Applicant \ncompleted her security clearance application and signed her Answer to the SOR using her married name. \nThere is no indication that she has legally changed her name back to her maiden name. \n\n2 \n \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn March 19, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \ndecision based on the written record without a hearing by an administrative judge from the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). On April 18, 2019, the Government \nsubmitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM), consisting of six exhibits (Items 1-6). DOHA \nforwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant on April 22, 2019, and instructed her to \nrespond within 30 days of receipt. Applicant received the FORM on May 10, 2019. She did \nnot submit any additional information in response to the FORM. On July 9, 2019, the case \nwas assigned to me to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. I received the case \nfile on July 15, 2019. \n \nEvidentiary Ruling \n \n \n  \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted, as Item 3, summary reports of subject interviews of \nApplicant conducted on January 10, 2018, and March 8, 2018. The summary reports were \npart of the DOD Report of Investigation (ROI) in Applicant\u2019s case. Under \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the \nDirective, a DOD personnel background report of investigation may be received in \nevidence and considered with an authenticating witness, provided it is otherwise admissible \nunder the Federal Rules of Evidence. The summary reports did not bear the authentication \nrequired for admissibility under \u00b6 E3.1.20. \n  \nIn ISCR Case No. 16-03126 decided on January 24, 2018, the Appeal Board held \nthat it was not error for an administrative judge to admit and consider a summary of \npersonal subject interview where the applicant was placed on notice of her opportunity to \nobject to consideration of the summary; the applicant filed no objection to it; and there is no \nindication that the summary contained inaccurate information. In this case, Applicant was \nprovided a copy of the FORM and advised of her opportunity to submit objections or \nmaterial that she wanted the administrative judge to consider. In the FORM, Applicant was \nadvised as follows:  \n  \nAlso, please note that the attached summaries of your Personal Subject \nInterview (PSI) \u2014 labeled as Enclosure 3 \u2014 is being provided to the \nAdministrative Judge for consideration as part of the record evidence in this \ncase. In your response to this File of Relevant Material (FORM), you can \ncomment on whether the PSI summary accurately reflects the information \nyou provided to the authorized OPM investigator(s) and you can make any \ncorrections, additions, deletions, and updates necessary to make the \nsummary clear and accurate. Alternatively, you can object on the ground that \nthe report is unauthenticated by a Government witness. If no objections are \nraised in your response to the FORM, or if you do not respond to the FORM, \nthe Administrative Judge may determine that you have waived any objections \n\n3 \n \nto the admissibility of the summary and may consider it as evidence in your \ncase. \n  \n Concerning whether Applicant understood the meaning of authentication or the \nlegal consequences of waiver, Applicant\u2019s pro se status does not confer any due process \nrights or protections beyond those afforded her if she was represented by legal counsel. \nShe was advised in \u00b6 E3.1.4 of the Directive that she may request a hearing. In \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nshe was advised that she is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, or \nmitigate facts admitted by her or proven by Department Counsel and that she has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision. While the \nDirective does not specifically provide for a waiver of the authentication requirement, \nApplicant was placed on sufficient notice of her opportunity to object to the admissibility of \nthe interview summary report, to comment on the interview summary, and to make any \ncorrections, deletions, or updates to the information in the report. She did not respond to \nthe FORM. In the absence of any objections or indication that the summary reports of her \ninterviews contain inaccurate information, I accepted Item 3 in evidence, subject to issues \nof relevance and materiality in light of the entire record. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of the February 6, 2019 SOR, Applicant \nowed a $445 wireless phone debt in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and charged-off student loans \nof $9,102 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and $19,552 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). When Applicant responded to the SOR \nallegations, she explained that she had been unaware of the wireless phone debt before \nthe SOR, but she has since paid it. She acknowledged the defaulted student loans, which \nshe obtained as a minor, and indicated that they have been taken on by her co-signer. \n(Item 1.) After considering the FORM, which includes Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, I \nmake the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old defense-contractor employee seeking a DOD security \nclearance. She has been working for her current employer as a contract administrator \nsince June 2014. Applicant was divorced in September 2015, after ten years of marriage. \nShe has two sons, ages 12 and 16. From July 2008 to March 2015, she resided with her \nparents and then with her older sister, so she and her ex-husband may have been \nseparated well before their divorce, although it is unclear. (Item 2.) \n \nApplicant pursued her undergraduate studies on and off from 2001 to May 2016, \nwhen she earned her bachelor\u2019s degree. She obtained approximately $72,000 in student \nloans. Two of the loans, obtained for $4,500 in January 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and $10,000 in \nSeptember 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), were co-signed. Seventeen other student loans were taken \non by Applicant individually. (Items 3-6.) \n \nApplicant was a stay-at-home mother throughout 2007. In August 2008, she began \nworking as a part-time teacher\u2019s assistant. In October 2011, she started caring for her \ngrandmother and son in the evenings and weekends, being paid for her services under a \nstate program. She continued to work part-time during the day at the school district until \n\n4 \n \nOctober 2013, when she left that job to seek other employment. In June 2014, Applicant \nbegan full-time employment with a defense contractor while continuing to be paid for her \nwork as a caregiver. (Items 2-3.) \n \nOn June 29, 2017, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). She responded affirmatively to the \nfollowing financial record inquiry: \u201cIn the past seven (7) years, you had any account or \ncredit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed? (Include \nfinancial obligations for which you were the sole debtor, as well as those for which you \nwere a cosigner or guarantor).\u201d She disclosed an outstanding $445 cellphone debt (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a) incurred because she lacked a steady income at the time to consistently pay for her \nservice. She gave an estimated date of September 2011 for the delinquency and indicated \nthat the debt may have been charged off. She admitted that she had taken no action to \nresolve it. She listed no other past-due debts. (Item 2.) \n \nAs of July 12, 2017, Applicant had three outstanding collection debts on her credit \nrecord. In addition to the $445 cell phone debt (SOR \u00b6 1.a), which had been in collection \nsince December 2014, the two joint student loans from 2002 had been charged off in 2011 \nand were in collection for $9,102 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and $19,552 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Applicant\u2019s other \nstudent loans, with an aggregate balance then of $80,980, were deferred. She was making \ntimely payments on a car loan obtained for $23,891 in August 2014 (balance $13,532), and \non credit cards with balances of $2,252, $540, $307, and $1,248. (Item 4.) \n \nOn January 10, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for \nthe Office of Personnel Management (OPM). She admitted that the $445 wireless phone \ndelinquency had not been resolved. As for her two charged-off student loans, Applicant \nadmitted that she had not contacted the loan servicer about repayment because she \nassumed that the debts would be removed from her credit record after the passage of time. \nShe lacked the steady income to consistently make payments on her student loans. Her \nFederal student loans had been reported as past due in the summer of 2015. She disputed \nthe delinquency, and indicated that the loans were in deferment. She indicated that she \nwould arrange to begin repaying her student loans in 2018. She had not started to repay \nany of her student loans or the wireless phone debt, citing limited income and her being a \nsingle parent. She had not received any financial counseling, but she indicated that she \nwas living within her means. (Item 3.) \n \nAs of October 2018, the student loan delinquencies in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c were no \nlonger on her credit report. Her Federal student loans had reportedly been delinquent in \n2015, but they were not currently past due. No payment amounts were shown on her credit \nreport, so it is likely that the loans were deferred. She was making timely payments of $385 \non a new car loan obtained for $12,366 (balance $7,666) in September 2017, after \nsatisfying an older car loan from 2014. Credit card balances totaling $6,167 and an \nunsecured loan obtained in June 2018 for $8,022 (balance $7,540) were being repaid on \ntime. (Item 5.) \n \n\n5 \n \nAs of March 12, 2019, the collection entity holding the wireless phone debt (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a) was reporting the debt as settled, but not the amount paid. Applicant asserts that she \npaid the debt in full after she received the SOR. Applicant stated that the charged-off \nstudent loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d) \u201chave been taken on by [her] co-signer.\u201d (Item 1.) \nApplicant presented no evidence of any payments or repayment arrangements by her or \nher co-signer on the student loans. \n \nAs of April 17, 2019, Applicant\u2019s other student loans were rated as current with a \ntotal balance of $88,366. Four loans with a $24,701 aggregate balance were rated as \ncurrent with a March 2019 date of last payment, although no actual payment was noted. \nShe was scheduled to make $703 monthly payments toward her $63,665 in Federal \nstudent-loan balances. It is unclear whether she was making payments on her Federal \nloans or whether they were deferred. The loan status for each loan was \u201cpays accounts as \nagreed,\u201d but no actual payments were reported on her credit report. Applicant was making \ntimely payments on seven credit-card accounts on which she owed $15,263. In March \n2019, she paid $1,125 toward a credit card that had a $91 monthly scheduled payment. \nShe was paying her September 2017 car loan and her June 2018 unsecured loan on time. \n(Item 6.) \n \nNo information is in the record evidence about Applicant\u2019s current income or her \nmonthly expenses, so a reasonable assessment of her financial situation is precluded. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \n\n6 \n \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n\n7 \n \n \nAvailable credit reports and Applicant\u2019s admissions establish the delinquencies in \nthe SOR. Applicant defaulted on two student loans on which she had a co-signer. As of \nJune 2017, the loans had collection balances of $19,552 and $9,102. A $445 wireless \nphone debt, in collection as of August 2016, was also unpaid as of February 2019. \nDisqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of \nnot meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply. \n \nApplicant has the burden of establishing mitigation. One or more of the following \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 may apply in whole or in part: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. The cell phone and student loan collection debts \nbecame delinquent several years ago. However, the debts were not resolved at the time \nthe February 2019 SOR was issued, even though Applicant was aware of the DOD\u2019s \nconcerns about her delinquent obligations discussed in her January 2018 personal subject \ninterview. The debts are considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts \nevidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for \npurposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)).  \n \n \nApplicant attributes her financial problems to lack of income and being a single \nparent. AG \u00b6 20(b) has some applicability. Although her divorce was not final until \nSeptember 2015, she and her spouse may have separated well before then. She was living \nwith her parents and was working as a part-time teacher\u2019s assistant when her student loans \nwere charged off in 2011. In October 2011, she began being paid by the state to care for \nfamily members. She had two sons to support on her limited income. \n \n\n8 \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to \ncircumstances outside of her control, I have to consider whether Applicant acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with her financial difficulties. See ISCR Case No. 05-\n11366 at 4, n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. \nMay 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether Applicant maintained \ncontact with her creditors. The evidence is mixed in that regard. Applicant disputes that her \nFederal student loans had been delinquent during the summer of 2015 because the loans \nshould have been in deferment. Even assuming a brief delinquency because of paperwork \nor processing delays, Applicant acted responsibly toward most of her student loans by \nobtaining deferments. However, Applicant did not display the same sound judgment when \nshe ignored her long past-due student loans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. She admitted during \nher January 2018 subject interview that she had not contacted the loan servicer because \nthe accounts would be removed from her credit report after the passage of time. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are only minimally established. Applicant is credited with \nsettling the cell phone collection debt in March 2019. In response to the SOR, she \nindicated that her co-signer had taken responsibility for the charged-off student loans. \nThose student loans no longer appear on her credit report, but their removal does not \neliminate them from security concern. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires removal of \nmost negative financial items from a credit report seven years from the first date of \ndelinquency or the debt becoming collection barred because of a state statute of \nlimitations, whichever is longer.2 Debts may be dropped from a credit report when creditors \nbelieve the debt is not going to be paid or when the debt has been charged off or for some \nother reason. The Appeal Board has addressed the issue of debts that may no longer be \nlegally collectible, as follows: \nThe security significance of long delinquent debts is not diminished merely \nbecause the debts have become legally unenforceable owing to the passage \nof time. Security clearance decisions are not controlled or limited by any \nstatute of limitation, and reliance on the non-collectability of a debt does not \nconstitute a good-faith effort to resolve that debt within the meaning of the \nDirective. A security clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at \ncollecting an applicant\u2019s personal debts. Rather a security clearance \nadjudication is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness to make a decision about the applicant\u2019s \nsecurity eligibility. Accordingly, even if a delinquent debt is legally \nunenforceable . . . , the federal government is entitled to consider the facts \nand circumstances surrounding an applicant\u2019s conduct in incurring and failing \nto satisfy the debt in a timely manner. \n2 Title 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c. See Federal Trade Commission website, Summary of Fair Credit Reporting Act \nUpdates at Section 605, https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0111-fair-credit-reportingact.pdf.   \n\n9 \n \nISCR Case No. 17-01473 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2018) (quoting ISCR Case No. 10-03656 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 19, 2011)). Without any evidence of current efforts at repayment, it \ncannot reasonably be inferred that her delinquent student loans are being resolved.  \n \n \nThe Appeal Board has held that an applicant is not required to establish that she \nhas paid off each debt in the SOR, or even that the first debts paid be those in the SOR. \nSee ISCR Case No. 07-06482 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). The Appeal Board recently \nreiterated in ADP Case No. 17-0063 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2018) that \u201can applicant must \ndemonstrate a plan for debt repayment, accompanied by concomitant conduct, that is, \nconduct that evidences a serious intent to resolve the debts.\u201d Applicant has demonstrated \nthat she can handle some financial accounts responsibly, as shown by her timely payments \non several credit-card accounts, her car loan, and her unsecured loan. However, she is \nlegally liable for student loans that have accrued to $117,000 ($88,366 rated as current) \nthat will have to be repaid at some point. Too many unanswered questions exist about her \npresent financial situation. For the reasons noted, the financial considerations security \nconcerns are not sufficiently mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of her conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nSome of the adjudicative process factors were addressed under Guideline F, but \nsome warrant additional comment. Applicant is credited with pursuing her college degree to \nobtain a better job. It took her some 15 years to obtain her bachelor\u2019s degree, likely \nbecause of her other commitments as a mother, part-time teaching assistant, caregiver for \nfamily members, and more recently a full-time employee for a defense contractor. Her \nlimited income as a single parent likely provided the basis for continued deferments of her \nFederal student loans. However, Applicant has been on notice since January 2018 that the \nDOD was concerned about her student-loan delinquencies. She requested a decision on \nthe written record, so it was incumbent on her to provide the evidence that might extenuate \nor mitigate her years of disregard of the charged-off student loans. Applicant was advised \nin the FORM that she needed to provide more in mitigation than merely an uncorroborated \nassertion that her co-signer would now handle the loans. She chose not to respond to the \nFORM. For the reasons noted above, I am unable to grant her security clearance eligibility \nat this time. \n\n10 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The \naction was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent, Directive 4, National Adjudicative \nGuidelines (SEAD 4), effective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on February 3, 2019, and elected to have his \ncase decided on the basis of the written record.

He timely supplemented the record with a payment agreement with the only \ncreditor listed in the SOR (\u00b6 1.a). Applicant\u2019s post-FORM submission was admitted \nwithout objection. The case was assigned to me on July 29, 2019. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly accumulated one delinquent debt of \n$10,733. (Item 1) Allegedly, his accrued delinquent debt remains unresolved and \noutstanding. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegation with explanations. \nHe claimed he experienced financial hardships: losing his job, house, and fianc\u00e9, facing \nunemployment for six months, and having to help his son who was diagnosed with \ncancer. Applicant expressed shame for the neglect he exhibited in handling his SOR \u00b6 1.a \ndebt. He claimed his morals, values, ethics, and integrity remain unbroken. And, he \nclaimed he is now financially stable and is working to resolve the SOR \u00b6 1.a debt. \nFinding   s    of Fact \nApplicant is a 31-year-old systems administrator for a defense contractor who \nseeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by \nApplicant are incorporated and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional \nfindings follow. \nBackground \nApplicant never married and has one child. (Item 3) He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree \nin criminal justice from an accredited college in July 2011. (Item 7) \nSince September 2016, Applicant has worked for his current defense contractor. \n(Item 3) Previously, he worked for other firms in various types of jobs. He reported \nunemployment between March and September 2014. (Item 3) \nApplicant\u2019s finances \nDuring times of struggle with his employment and personal relationships with his \nfamily, Applicant defaulted on a credit card account. His credit reports reveal that \nAppellant opened ths account (SOR \u00b6 1.a) in March 2004 with a high credit balance of \n$13,200, and he became delinquent on the account in June 2013. (Item 3-6) At the time \nof his first delinquency, he owed $10,733 on the account. (Items 3-6) \nRecords confirm that Applicant took no actions to address his delinquent SOR \u00b6 \n1.a account until July 2019. (Item 7) At this time, he entered into an installment \nagreement with creditor 1.a as follows: Settlement of the balance due for a reduced \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npayment of $4,293, payable in monthly increments of $357, beginning in June 2019.

(Item 7) \nApplicant documented that he is in full compliance with his payment agreement with \ncreditor 1.a. \nPolicies \nThe SEAD 4, App. A lists guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the \ndecision-making process covering security clearance cases. These guidelines take into \naccount factors that could create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, \nas well as considerations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could \nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and \nmany of the conditions that could mitigate security concerns. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. The guidelines do not require \nadministrative judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is to \nbe evaluated in the context of the whole person in accordance with App. A. AG \u00b6 2\u00a9. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the \npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in App. A, AG \n\u00b6 2(d) of the AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial \ncommonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines \nwithin the context of the whole person. \nThe adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period of an \napplicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the applicant is \nan acceptable security risk. The following App A, AG \u00b6 2(d) factors are pertinent: (1) the \nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent in this case: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse of \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. . . .  AG \u00b6 18. \nBurden of Proof \nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant or \ncontinue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding \nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. Because the Directive \nrequires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence \naccumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that \nevidence. See United States, v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509-511 (1995). \nAs with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences \nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the \njudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture. \nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial \nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that \nthe facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain \na security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not require the \nGovernment to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or \nabused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather, \nthe judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an applicant may \ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or \ncontroverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of \nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation, \nor mitigation. Based on the requirement of Exec. Or. 10865 that all security clearances \nbe clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance determinations \nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nAnalysis  \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s accumulation of one sizable \ndelinquent debt in 2013. Applicant\u2019s history of financial difficulties warrant the \napplication of three of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; 19(b), \u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of ability to \ndo so\u201d;  and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s admitted delinquent debt negates the need for any independent \nproof. See Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.14; McCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 262 (6th ed. 2006). \nEach of Applicant\u2019s admitted debt is fully documented and creates some judgment \nissues. See ISCR Case 03-01059 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004). \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles him to access classified information. While the principal concern of a security \nclearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving debt \ndelinquencies. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23, 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). Applicant\u2019s \ncited circumstances (brief unemployment in 2014) provide some extenuating benefit. \nMC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected \nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances,\u201d applies to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nvoluntary payment of debts, and implicitly where applicable the timely resolution of \ndelinquent debts. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) In \nApplicant\u2019s case, his documented settlement of his SOR \u00b6 1.a debt with arranged \nmonthly payments on a reduced debt, enables him to achieve favorable findings and \nconclusions with respect to raised security concerns over the state of his finances. \nWhole-Person Assessment \nWhole-person assessment is favorable to Applicant. He has shown sufficient \nprogress to date in addressing his delinquent debts to merit enough positive credit to \nmitigate financial concerns. Overall, Applicant\u2019s actions to date in addressing his single \ncited debt reflects sufficient evidence of restored financial responsibility and judgment to \novercome reasonable doubts about his trustworthiness, reliability, and ability to protect \nclassified information. See AG \u00b6 18. Conclusions are warranted that his finances are \nsufficiently stabilized at this time to meet minimum eligibility requirements for holding a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility to hold a security clearance under the facts and \ncircumstances of this case is consistent with the national interest. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                      \n                                                                    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                          \n                                        \nFormal Findings \nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the \ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I \nmake the following formal findings: \nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): FOR APPLICANT\n  Subparagraph 1.a:   \n   For Applicant\n   Conclusions \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility to hold a \nsecurity clearance.

Cervi, Administrative Judge \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on October 29, 2017. \nOn February 8, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent him a statement of reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nand DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). The Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \nwere revised effective June 8, 2017, and apply herein. Applicant answered the SOR \n(Ans.) on March 19, 2019, and requested a hearing. \n \nThe case was assigned to me on February 25, 2019. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on August 20, 2019, scheduling \n\n \n2 \n \nthe hearing for September 12, 2019. The hearing was convened as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 were admitted into evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified, and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B, which were admitted \ninto evidence without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September \n20, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old logistics information technology task lead, employed by \na defense contractor since 2017. He received his first master\u2019s degree in 2009, and his \nsecond master\u2019s degree in 2016. He served on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps from \nhis enlistment in 1994 until he retired as a Chief Warrant Officer 3 in 2014. He was \npreviously married in 1996, but it was annulled in 1998. He remarried 2001 and has three \nchildren, all teenagers that live with him. Applicant\u2019s 2017 interim security clearance was \nrevoked in September 2019. \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy \nin December 2018 that is pending; has two federal tax debts totaling $35,136 for tax years \n2016 and 2017; and two state tax debts totaling $12,335 for tax years 2016 and 2017. \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations with explanations. Applicant filed his federal and \nstate tax returns on time, but did not have the funds to pay taxes owed. \n \nApplicant opened a cigar lounge in 2014 that he sold for a profit in 2017. He then \nopened a sandwich shop in 2017, but quickly changed it into a coffee shop. The same \nyear he opened another cigar lounge and barber shop, but all of the businesses closed \nin 2018. These endeavors were unprofitable.  \n \nApplicant consulted a bankruptcy attorney in late 2018, and filed a Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy in December 2018. He listed total liabilities of $621,291 and was required to \npay $221,110 under a Chapter 13 repayment plan. Applicant was unable to make the \nplan payments, and in August 2019, he was notified that the bankruptcy would be \ndismissed if he did not convert it to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy or make the required plan \npayments. Applicant testified that he expected the bankruptcy would be dismissed by the \nend of September 2019. \n \nAs of the date of the hearing, Applicant had not made arrangements to pay \ndelinquent federal and state taxes, and while the bankruptcy was pending, he was \nprevented from expending funds outside the bankruptcy process. Applicant\u2019s home in \nanother state was foreclosed in August 2019, and he testified that he may owe a \ndeficiency balance. \n \nWhile employed with his current employer, Applicant earns a combined salary, \nmilitary retirement, and veteran\u2019s disability income totaling $182,000. He has about \n$2,200 in savings. In testimony, Applicant took full responsibility for his financial \npredicament, and understands the security concerns his financial status invokes. \nApplicant\u2019s colleagues and friends provided character letters attesting to his work ethic, \n\n \n3 \n \nreliability, trustworthiness, and dedication. He is praised for his military service and \nperformance as a defense contractor. Applicant received court-mandated financial \ncounseling before filing his bankruptcy petition.  \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \n\n \n4 \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition,  \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the record are sufficient \nto establish the disqualifying conditions above. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n\n \n5 \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control. \n \nApplicant\u2019s soon to be dismissed bankruptcy and tax debts arose to some degree, \nfrom two unsuccessful businesses. Applicant filed tax returns when due, but failed to pay \ntaxes when owed, resulting in state and federal tax liabilities of over $47,000. Additionally, \nhis financial liabilities total $621,291, and he lost a home to foreclosure in August 2019. \nDespite Applicant\u2019s current income of $182,000, he was unable to comply with the \nChapter 13 bankruptcy payment plan, and expects the bankruptcy to be dismissed. \nApplicant\u2019s plan to address his debts and delinquent taxes is unclear, and he was unable \nto articulate a new financial plan during testimony. He had financial counseling prior to \nfiling bankruptcy, but there is no evidence that he has a firm handle on his financial \ncondition and there are doubts about his financial decision making. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has long held: \n \nSecurity requirements include consideration of a person\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and a sense of his or her legal obligations. Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union, Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). Failure to comply with Federal tax laws suggests \nthat an applicant has a problem with abiding by well-established \ngovernment rules and regulations. Voluntary compliance with rules and \nregulations is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). \n \nApplicant was unable to pay taxes while operating failed businesses, however his \ninability to make required plan payments in bankruptcy is inexplicable given his current \nincome.  His financial problems have been longstanding and remain a current concern. \nApplicant failed to produce a plan to address his financial situation, and to pay past-due \ntaxes and resolve debts that will presumably not be discharged in bankruptcy. \n \nOverall, I believe Applicant attempted to utilize the bankruptcy court to relieve the \nstrain on his finances and address his debts, but since he did not successfully comply \nwith the process, he is back to square one financially. I am unable to conclude that his \nfinancial problems are under control or are unlikely to recur. No conditions fully apply to \nmitigate his delinquent tax and other debts. I remain doubtful about Applicant\u2019s financial \nresponsibility and good judgment with regard to finances. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Although adverse information concerning a single criterion \nmay not be sufficient for an unfavorable eligibility determination, the individual may be \nfound ineligible if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of \nquestionable judgment, irresponsibility, or unstable behavior. AG \u00b6 2(e). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of \nfact and comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Despite Applicant\u2019s \neducation and military service, he has not shown financial responsibility once the option \nof bankruptcy was underway, and he has not shown a reasonable effort or plan to address \nhis tax liabilities. \n \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest of the United States to grant him eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.e:  \n  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest of the United \nStates to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance is \ndenied. \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nGregg A. Cervi \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Henderson, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n07/29/2019 \n______________ \n \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn February 8, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 11, 2019, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on May 7, 2019. \nHe was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \n\n \n2 \n \n \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. The Government\u2019s \nevidence is identified as Items 1 through 9. Applicant did not submit a timely response. \nThere were no objections by Applicant, and all Items are admitted into evidence. The \ncase was assigned to me on July 10, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 44 years old. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2007 and a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2009. He never married. He has three children ages 19, 26, and 4 \nyears old. He served in the military and was honorably discharged. He has been \nemployed by federal contractors since 2007 and the same federal contractor since 2015.  \n \nApplicant completed a security clearance application in May 2016. In it, he \ndisclosed that he had delinquent student loans that were in collection status (SOR \u00b6 1.a-\n$40,114 and \u00b6 1.c-$26,631). He stated: \u201cmonthly payment plan in process.\u201d He further \nstated: \u201cI\u2019ve set up monthly payment plans this will eventually pay this bill off.\u201d He also \ndisclosed that he has taken vacations on an island for six to ten days in 2014 and 2015. \n(Item 2)  \n \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in September 2017. He \nagain disclosed his delinquent student loans and told the investigator that he had not \nmade a payment since March 2016, but he was seeking a second job. In October 2018, \nhe was interviewed again and told the investigator that he was initiating a plan to pay his \nstudent loans not later than November 2018. He said that he had secured a second job. \nHe attributed his financial problems to a period in 2016 when his children were no longer \nliving with him and his child support payments increased. (Items 3, 4) \n \nApplicant stated in his March 2019 SOR answer, regarding the student loan debts \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c that he was working on a payment plan with the creditor. He stated: \n\u201cI don\u2019t have the information to send in today, but I will be able to send the information on \na later date.\u201d Applicant was afforded that opportunity when he received the FORM to \nprovide information. He did not provide additional documentary evidence that he is \nresolving his delinquent student loans. (Item 1) \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he provided documentary proof that he paid the \ncollection debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b; settled the charged-off debt in \u00b6 1.d; paid the past-due \namount owed for the debt in \u00b6 1.e; and his child support obligation was paid and resolved \n(\u00b6 1.f). Applicant also provided a document to show the past-due amount owed for the \nmotorcycle he purchased in December 2015, was paid (\u00b6 1.g). (Item 1).  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of ability to do so; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n \nApplicant had numerous delinquent or past-due debts that he has been unable or \nunwilling to resolve. He also has two student loans that have been delinquent since 2016. \nThere is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n\n \n5 \n \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nApplicant resolved the smaller delinquent or past-due debts alleged in SOR, but \nhis student loans, totaling approximately $66,745, have not been resolved. These debts \nare recent and ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to an increase in child support payments \nwhen his children were no longer living with him in approximately 2016. This was \nsomewhat beyond Applicant\u2019s control. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant \nmust have acted responsibly. He repeatedly made statements that he was arranging to \npay his delinquent student loans, but failed to provide proof of his actions. AG \u00b6 20(b) has \npartial application.  \n \n \nThere is no evidence Applicant has received financial or credit counseling. There \nare not clear indications that his financial problems related to his student loans are \nresolved or under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. There is evidence he paid and \nresolved the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d through 1.g. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to those \ndebts.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is 44 years old. Applicant repeatedly stated that he was working on a \npayment plan to resolve his significant delinquent student loans. He had an opportunity \nto provide documentary proof of any action he may have taken, but failed to provide it. At \nthis juncture, Applicant has not met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves \nme with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.g: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

(Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2)  \n \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \n\n \n2 \n                                         \n \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline I. \n \nOn April 5, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR, and she requested a hearing. \n(HE 3) On May 9, 2019, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On May 31, 2019, \nthe case was assigned to me. On June 28, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for July 11, 2019. (HE 1) \nApplicant waived her right to 15 days of notice of the date, time, and location of her \nhearing. (Tr. 12-13)   \n  \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered five exhibits; Applicant offered \neight exhibits; Applicant did not object to Department Counsel\u2019s exhibits; and Department \nCounsel\u2019s proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. (Transcript (Tr.) 16; \nGovernment Exhibit (GE) 1-5) Department Counsel objected to Applicant Exhibit (AE) A, \na statement from Dr. Y, Applicant\u2019s current treating psychologist, and AE B, a  statement \nfrom Applicant\u2019s mother, due to lack of authentication because they were unsigned, had \nno letterhead, and the statement from her treating psychiatrist contained two different \nfonts and repeated a sentence. (Tr. 17-18, 54-55) Applicant said the statements were \ndocuments she received via email from her physician and mother, and she said she would \nobtain authentication after the hearing. (Tr. 18-21, 54-56) I admitted the documents \nindicating the lack of signatures went to the weight the documents would receive. (Tr. 21) \nDepartment Counsel had no additional objections and the eight exhibits were admitted. \n(AE A-AE H) On July 19, 2019, DOHA received a transcript of the hearing. On August 2, \n2019, Dr. Y emailed a signed letter to me. (AE I) On August 5, 2019, Applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s \nnotarized letter was provided to me. (AE J) Department Counsel did not object to \nadmissibility of AE I and AE J.  The record closed on August 9, 2019. (Tr. 88) \n \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant was \u201cdiagnosed with possible Psychosis, possible \nBipolar Disorder, and possible Borderline or Antisocial Personality Disorder based in part \non [her] history of high-risk behaviors, including assuming other people\u2019s identities, self-\nharm, thoughts of harming others, and taking out a $20,000 loan in your mother\u2019s name \nwithout her permission.\u201d  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that in December 2018, a licensed psychologist \u201cdiagnosed \n[Applicant] with Other Specified Personality Disorder (mixed personality features) and \nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder.\u201d \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, she denied SOR \u00b6 1.a and admitted SOR \u00b6 1.b. (HE \n3) She also provided extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant\u2019s admissions are \naccepted as findings of fact. Additional findings of fact follow.  \n \n\n \n3 \n                                         \n \nApplicant is 34 years old, and she is a senior consultant and program management \noffice software development team lead. (Tr. 6, 29; GE 1) In 2002, she graduated from \nhigh school. (Tr. 6) In 2012, she received a bachelor\u2019s degree with a major in political \nscience with a focus in international affairs. (Tr. 6-7, 28) In 2019, she received a master\u2019s \ndegree in international security. (Tr. 6-7) She has never married, and she does not have \nany children. (Tr. 7) Her parents divorced when she was six years old. (Tr. 76) She has \nno siblings; however, she is close to her stepbrother. (Tr. 77) She has not served in the \nU.S. armed forces. (Tr. 7)     \n \nPsychological Conditions \n \nWhen Applicant was 10 years old, she received treatment for autism-related issues \nbecause she had anxiety and difficulty reading social cues. (Tr. 31) From age 10 to 12, \nshe did not receive treatment, and then treatment resumed when she was 13, stopped \nwhen she was 14, and resumed again when she was 15. (Tr. 32) She was occasionally \nprescribed antidepressants. (Tr. 32) \n \nWhen Applicant was 16 years old, her 20-year-old team lead during an internship \nsexually assaulted her. (Tr. 33, 39, 59-62; AE J at 2-3) Applicant described it as a \u201cdate \nrape.\u201d (Tr. 61) She made a police report about the assault about four years later; however, \nhe was never charged. (Tr. 61) She received mental-health treatment for about six \nmonths. (Tr. 33, 62)  \n \nDr. K\u2019s Treatment and Notes \n \nDr. K\u2019s treatment notes are a combination of brief handwritten notes and checklists. \n(GE 4) The notes are a series of conclusions with few supporting details or facts about \nApplicant\u2019s past conduct and behavior. (GE 4)   \n \nDuring therapy after the sexual assault occurring about 18 years ago, Applicant \nwondered whether she had been previously sexually assaulted by her father or someone \nelse. (Tr. 39) She had some flashes or dreams about being sexually assaulted. (Tr. 40) \nShe was confident that her father had not sexually assaulted her. (Tr. 40) She regretted \ntelling Dr. K years later about her previous suspicions about her father sexually molesting \nher. (Tr. 40-41) She was able to rule out the possibility that her father sexually assaulted \nher. (Tr. 41) She believed a babysitter may have sexually assaulted her when she was \nabout three years old based on \u201cvague impressions.\u201d (Tr. 41) Applicant\u2019s mother \ndescribed the sexual assault in her statement. (AE J at 3) \n \nIn December 2012 and January 2013, Applicant sought and received treatment \nfrom Dr. K because she was upset, embarrassed, and ashamed about having an 18-\nmonth affair with an older, married coworker. (Tr. 22, 34, 36, 62-65) It was against her \nemployer\u2019s informal unofficial rules; however, she denied that she engaged in the affair \nto obtain any professional advantage. (Tr. 22, 64-65; AE J at 4) She ended the affair \nbecause she knew it was morally wrong and they were \u201clying to everybody.\u201d (Tr. 62) She \nmay have exaggerated her faults in the way she described her behavior to Dr. K because \nshe wanted accountability. (Tr. 22, 24, 67; AE J at 1) She was highly anxious, and she \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \nwanted Dr. K to take her concerns seriously. (Tr. 22-23) She wanted him to help her \naddress the underlying cause of her bad decisions. (Tr. 23, 34-35, 67) She met with Dr. \nK six times, and then he retired. (Tr. 23, 45) Her treatment was transferred to Dr. M, and \nshe saw him once or twice, and then she stopped seeking counseling. (Tr. 23, 45-46)  \n \nDr. K\u2019s treatment notes indicate \u201c\u2018when I script or pattern after others\u2019 boyfriend in \nmartial arts, tried to appear as martial artist.\u201d (GE 4 at 1) His notes indicate she assumed \nthe identities of other people and portrayed different personalities. (GE 4 at 1) However, \nDr. K did not explain how she said she manifested these behaviors other than his note \nabout Applicant\u2019s involvement in martial arts. He does indicate Applicant explained that \nsometimes she adopted mannerisms of friends; however, she denied that she assumed \ntheir identities. (Tr. 68) She was in a two-year relationship with a man who showed her \nsome martial arts. (Tr. 68) He complimented her athletic ability in martial arts, and she \ntold Dr. K that she was good in martial arts. (Tr. 69) This was an exaggeration because \nshe did not have any formal training in martial arts. (Tr. 69) She denied that she has ever \nlied about her name, occupation, or educational background. (Tr. 69) Dr. K said she was \na \u201cpathological liar\u201d and \u201cmade up stories\u201d (GE 4 at 1); however, he did not give an \nexample or provide a basis for these conclusions.  \n \nApplicant experimented with cutting herself when she was 19 or 20 years old; \nhowever, the cutting was slight and so insignificant that she did not bleed. (Tr. 70) She \ntried it because some of her friends were doing it. (Tr. 70) Dr. K described her admission \nof self-harm or cutting. Applicant\u2019s mother denied that Applicant engaged in self-harm. \n(AE J at 3) He also indicated she engaged in other high-risk behaviors including assuming \nother\u2019s identities, homicidal ideation, taking out a loan in her mother\u2019s name, and noted \nhis diagnosis of possible Psychosis, possible Bipolar Disorder, and possible Borderline \nor Antisocial Personality Disorder.  \n \nDr. K indicated in his medical records that Applicant forged her mother\u2019s signature \non a $20,000 student loan application. (Tr. 51) Applicant said she signed her mother\u2019s \nname on the application for a $7,000 student loan because her mother was out of the \ncountry. (Tr. 51; SOR response) Applicant\u2019s mother corroborated Applicant\u2019s statement \nabout the circumstances of Applicant signing her mother\u2019s name. (AE J at 2) When \nApplicant\u2019s mother returned, Applicant told her that she signed her name on the \napplication. (Tr. 52) Her mother asked her not to sign her name without informing her first. \n(Tr. 52) Applicant repaid the student loan. (Tr. 51; AE J at 2) Applicant never intended to \ncommit theft or deceive her mother about the loan. (Tr. 53) \n \nDr. K said Applicant disclosed that she shoplifted a necklace when she was in \ncollege. Applicant admitted the theft to her mother. (AE J at 2) \n \nDr. K advised her that she needed medication to calm her and slow her racing \nthoughts, and not to address bipolar disorder. (Tr. 24) Dr. K said he was not going to \nformally diagnose Applicant. (Tr. 37) \u201cHe said that the medication would help [her with] \nanxiety and the rapid cycling of things.\u201d (Tr. 39) She took the medication as directed but \ngradually reduced the dosage. (Tr. 25) On December 12, 2012, Dr. K completed \u201chistory\u201d \nand a checklist of Applicant\u2019s mental health. (GE 4 at 1-7) Dr. K wrote rule out Bipolar \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \nand rule out Borderline or other personality disorder i.e. antisocial during his intake \n\u201cimpression.\u201d (GE 4 at 7) He repeated these impressions on December 27, 2012, and \nadded Psychosis Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). (GE 4 at 8) On January 8, 2013, Dr. K \nand Applicant discussed her relationship with a married man at work, and Dr. K said \u201cshe \nhad [an] affair to gain advantage in workplace\u201d and for \u201cimpression\u201d he wrote simply \n\u201cPsychosis NOS.\u201d (GE 4 at 9) On January 15, 2013, Dr. K wrote about Applicant\u2019s desire \nto appear attractive and desirable, and under \u201cimpression\u201d he again wrote \u201cPsychosis \nNOS.\u201d (GE 4 at 10) On January 22, 2013, Dr. K discussed Applicant\u2019s relationship with \nher mother and described Applicant as emotionally needy, and highly disorganized, and \nhis \u201cimpression\u201d was again \u201cPsychosis NOS\u201d and \u201cBorderline\u201d personality disorder. (GE \n4 at 11) Dr. K did not provide his final conclusions or diagnosis.  \n \nApplicant received prescriptions from Dr. K, Dr. M, and general practitioners for \nSeroquel, and it helped because it slowed her racing thoughts and reduced her anxiety. \n(Tr. 42-44, 46) However, it was \u201cpretty flattening\u201d and \u201cblunted\u201d her reactions to others. \n(Tr. 42) Applicant was aware that Seroquel \u201cis used to treat certain mental/mood \nconditions (such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, sudden episodes of mania or \ndepression associated with bipolar disorder).\u201d (Tr. 43-44; See also \u201cSeroquel\u201d webpage, \nWebMD website, https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-4718/seroquel-oral/details) Dr. \nK told her that he was prescribing Seroquel to help her with anxiety and to slow her \nemotions, and he never told her it was for the serious mental illnesses such as bipolar \ndisorder. (Tr. 44) Around March of 2018, she stopped taking Seroquel. (Tr. 44-45) \n \nEvaluation of Dr. B \n \nIn December 2018, Dr. B, a psychologist, reviewed Applicant\u2019s medical and \nsecurity records, conducted a Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) test, and \ninterviewed Applicant and her mother. (GE 2) Dr. B did not provide therapy or counseling \nto Applicant. Dr. B said: \n \nneuropsychiatric notes from [Dr. K in] 2012 show that she has a history of: \n\u201cpathological lying, being manipulative, making up stories, assuming \nidentities of others, portraying different personalities, telling people she was \na rape victim (accusing her father), telling people she had PTSD, trying to \nprove she was gay . . . sleeping with others\u2019 spouses to gain advantage in \nthe workplace . . .  preoccupation with image and needing to appear \nattractive, rapidly developing fantasy personas . . . thoughts of harming \nothers and self-harm.\u201d (GE 2 at 3-4)   \n \nWhen Dr. B called Applicant\u2019s mother, her mother said the loan Applicant applied \nfor was for $500. (GE 2 at 4) \n \nDuring Dr. B\u2019s interview of Applicant, Dr. B described Applicant in generally normal \nand positive terms. However, Dr. B said, \u201cHer insight, judgment, and memory seemed \npoor, and many of her recollections seemed vague.\u201d (GE 2 at 5) For example, Applicant \ndenied past self-harm and homicidal ideation. Applicant\u2019s guardedness was attributed to \n\u201ca combination of denial, concealment, and intentional lack of full candor.\u201d (GE 2 at 5) \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \nWhen Dr. B interviewed Applicant, she denied any history of self-harm. (Tr. 70) \nShe did not disclose that she told Dr. K about cutting herself. (Tr. 34, 70) She believed \nDr. B\u2019s question about self-harm was more focused on whether she was currently \nconsidering self-harm than on her conduct more than 10 years ago. (Tr. 70) She denied \nhaving any thoughts of self-injury or to harm others. (Tr. 70-71) Applicant has never been \na mental health inpatient. (Tr. 71) \n \nApplicant denied that she was a \u201cpathological liar,\u201d and she denied that she \nadmitted to Dr. K that she was a pathological liar. (Tr. 39) She denied that she assumed \nthe identity of another. (Tr. 39) Dr. B noted that based on Applicant\u2019s self-report and her \nPAI, which she described as \u201cvalid,\u201d \u201cit would seem she was grappling with mild anxiety.\u201d \n(GE 2 at 7) However, Dr. B concluded because of background information, her clinical \ninterview, and observations and PAI \u201cshe may meet criteria for a personality disorder.\u201d \n(GE 2 at 7)  \n \nDr. B concluded that Applicant\u2019s \u201cbehavioral health history suggests numerous \nbehaviors that cast doubt on her judgment, reliability and/or trustworthiness; as such, it \nmay be imprudent to grant her access to classified information. Based on previous \nmedical opinions and current diagnoses, she presents with conditions that could pose a \nsignificant risk to national security.\u201d (GE 2 at 8) \n  \nDr.  Y\u2019s Evaluation and Treatment \n \nAfter Dr. M\u2019s sessions, Applicant did not see a psychologist or psychiatrist until \nDecember 2018. (Tr. 47-48) Documentation from Dr. M\u2019s sessions is not included in the \nfile. (GE 4) She frequently attended church and she received some spiritual guidance \nbetween 2013 and 2018. (Tr. 47-48) She resumed treatment with Dr. Y, a psychologist, \nin December 2018 to help her with relationships. (Tr. 49-50) She had 23 appointments \nwith Dr. Y from December 2018 to July 2019. (Tr. 50; AE G)  \n \nDr. Y said he had read and assessed the reports by Dr. K and Dr. B, provided to \nApplicant in relation to her clearance hearing. Dr. Y described Applicant\u2019s mental \ncondition as follows: \n \n[S]he has a custom of seeking professional counseling, which comes from \nher family culture which views mental health similarly to physical health. \n[Her] commitment to personal growth, mental health and strong \nrelationships leads her to a healthy pattern of counseling and other healthy \nbehaviors. I have worked with [her] weekly since December of 2018 and \nhave found her to be responsible, candid, and discerning. I recommend her \nfor clearance at the Secret level. \n \n[She] voluntarily began cognitive behavioral therapy sessions with me in \nDecember 2018, and she has seen me regularly about once per week since \nthen. My overall assessment of [her] is that she is a woman who is \nvoluntarily and earnestly seeking to improve on a few primitive defense \nmechanisms that impact her immediate, primary relationships (e.g., her \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \nmother, a past serious boyfriend). She is consistently clear, alert, aware and \ncoherent; she is successful professionally and academically, builds and \nmaintains positive relationships with colleagues, supervisors, clients, \nfriends and acquaintances. Her home life has been consistent and stable \nfor nearly seven years. She is dedicated to and motivated by issues of \nnational security and is a strong patriot; she is intelligent, sensitive to \ninformation sharing violations, and a sensible professional. It is my view of \n[Applicant] that: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\uf0b7 She is aware of her shortcomings and faults and earnest in her desire \nand attempts at improving[.] \n\uf0b7 She does not display or report criminal, harmful, violent or erratic \nthoughts or behaviors[.] \n\uf0b7 She is forthcoming when discussing her goals for improvement[.] \n\uf0b7 She has displayed and maintained a strong and consistent sense of \nidentity throughout our sessions. \n\uf0b7 She generally maintains a consistent, steady demeanor. \n\uf0b7 She builds stable, positive and mature relationships with friends, \ncolleagues, family, and partners. \n \nI have not seen any of the very concerning behaviors referred to by Dr. [K] \nfrom 2013.  \n \n[Applicant] has not shown any paranoid or bizarre behaviors, delusional \nthinking, hallucinations, no self-harming or thoughts of harming others. She \nhas been engaging in healthy dating of men and has been doing well in her \nrelationship with her mother. \n \nSeven years is a long time and [Applicant] has been and continues to \nmature as a responsible adult woman. \n \nIt is my professional opinion that she can be trusted with classified \ninformation at the sensitive but unclassified and Secret levels and that she \nwill be an asset to national security. \n \n(AE I) \n \nApplicant has excellent credit, has never been arrested, has no record of violence \nagainst others, and an excellent work history. (Tr. 74; AE D; AE G; AE H) She has solid \nrelationships with family and friends. (Tr. 74) \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \nAnalysis \n  \n \nPsychological Conditions \n \nAG \u00b6 27 articulates the security concern for psychological conditions: \n \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \n \nAG \u00b6 28 provides two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors; and \n \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness. \n \n \nThe opinions of Dr. K and Dr. B are sufficient to establish AG \u00b6\u00b6 28(a) and 28(b). \nFurther details of their opinions will be discussed in the mitigation analysis, infra.  \n \n \nFive mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29 are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n\n \n10 \n                                         \n \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \n    \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 29(b) applies. During Dr. K\u2019s initial assessment of Applicant when he started \nhis treatment, he wrote possible Psychosis, possible Bipolar Disorder, and possible \nBorderline or Antisocial Personality Disorder. He did not provide a prediction or probability \nof his belief in the accuracy of these possibilities. His concluding \u201cimpression\u201d indicated \n\u201cPsychosis NOS\u201d and Borderline Personality Disorder. This \u201cimpression\u201d is an evaluative \ndetermination that is short of a diagnosis and is a step towards a diagnosis. He did not \ntell Applicant that he diagnosed her with Psychosis and/or Borderline Personality \nDisorder; however, he did prescribe Seroquel, which is often used to treat serious mental-\nhealth disorders involving Psychosis. Applicant believed Seroquel was prescribed to help \nher with racing thoughts and anxiety. She stopped taking Seroquel around March of 2018. \nThere is no evidence she failed to follow treatment advice or failed to take Seroquel \nagainst the advice of a mental-health provider.  \n \n \nDr. B indicated Applicant may have a personality disorder or may have mild \nanxiety. Dr. B focused on Applicant\u2019s behavior and conditions as the basis for a security \nconcern; however, Dr. B\u2019s belief that Applicant had behaviors of security concern was \nbased on Dr. K\u2019s cryptic notes and Applicant\u2019s unwillingness to provide corroboration of \nDr. K\u2019s concerns. Applicant acknowledged that she was under significant stress in \nDecember 2012 when she sought Dr. K\u2019s help, and she exaggerated her mental-health \nhistory to him to get him to take her concerns seriously. Although corroboration is not \n\n \n11 \n                                         \n \nrequired, and the Government has no burden to present such evidence, it is notable that \nthere was no corroboration from witness statements, hospital admissions, or police \nreports that Applicant\u2019s behaviors were of security concern.   \n \n \nClearly, the most reliable diagnosis is from Dr. Y, who had 23 sessions with \nApplicant from December 2018 to present. Treatment is continuing and the condition has \nnot completely resolved. The magnitude of Dr. Y\u2019s contacts with Applicant, and their \nrecency merit more weight than the opinions of Dr. K and Dr. B. Applicant\u2019s character \nstatement from her mother, and performance evaluations provide further corroboration of \nDr. Y\u2019s opinion that Applicant is sufficiently trustworthy to receive access to classified \ninformation. Psychological conditions security concerns are mitigated due to the \napplication of AG \u00b6 29 (b).    \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \n \n \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount \nconcern. The adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in \nconsidering the whole-person concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the \ntotality of his or her acts, omissions, and motivations as well as various other variables. \nEach case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant \ncircumstances and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the determination of whether to grant a security clearance must \nbe an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline I in my \nwhole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under that \nguideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 34 years old, and she is a senior consultant and program management \noffice software development team lead. In 2012, she received a bachelor\u2019s degree with a \nmajor in political science with a focus in international affairs. In 2019, she received a \nmaster\u2019s degree in international security. She has never married, and she does not have \nany children. Her parents divorced when she was six years old. She has no siblings; \nhowever, she is close to her stepbrother.  \n \n\n \n12 \n                                         \n \n There was a bona fide security concern in 2012 when Applicant sought assistance \nfrom Dr. K. She ended an adulterous relationship with a supervisor where she was \nemployed. She was under stress and exaggerated her mental health issues during her \ninterview with Dr. K.  \n \nApplicant has received a reliable diagnosis from Dr. Y, who has 23 sessions with \nApplicant from December 2018 to present. Dr. Y\u2019s opinion that Applicant is sufficiently \ntrustworthy to receive access to classified information is clear and convincing.     \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, \nExec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context \nof the whole person. Psychological conditions security concerns are mitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline I:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:   \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n_________________________ \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He did not provide sufficient information to mitigate the trustworthiness \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nsensitive information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on February 5, 2018. On March 5, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing trustworthiness concerns under the \nfinancial considerations and personal conduct guidelines. DOD took the action under \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective \nJune 8, 2017.  \n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 13, 2019, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). The \ncase was assigned to me on September 22, 2017. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on \nJuly 19, 2019, scheduling the hearing for September 11, 2019. The hearing convened as \nscheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1, 3, 4, and 5 were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. GE 2, an unauthenticated summary of Applicant\u2019s background interview, was \nnot admitted. Applicant testified and offered Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through C, which \nwere marked and admitted without objection. On September 23, 2019, Applicant \nsubmitted additional materials. I marked them as AE D through AE H and admitted them \nwithout objection. The record closed on September 23, 2019. DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on September 30, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.j, 1.l-1.n, and 1.p; he denied \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.k, 1.o. 1.q, and 1.r; and he partially admitted and partially denied SOR \u00b6 \n1.a. I construe his answer to the falsification allegation under Guideline E (SOR \u00b6 2.a) as \na denial. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and \ncareful review of the record evidence, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 31 years old. He has been married for about 18 months. He has four \nchildren between ages 9 and 14, and a stepchild. He graduated from high school in \n2007. He worked for a defense contractor at a naval shipyard from 2008 to July 2017, \nwhen he resigned after getting into a physical altercation with a co-worker. He testified \nthat the altercation began after the co-worker called Applicant a racial epithet during a \ndispute. Applicant resigned instead of being fired so he could maintain a right to be \nrehired in the future. (GE 1, Tr. 20, 31-34) \n \nApplicant was unemployed until he began working for his current employer in \nSeptember 2017. He seeks eligibility for a position of public trust so he can work on \ncertain projects. He often travels to various sites around the country for his job. (GE 1; \nTr. 32-33, 64-65) \n  \n \nApplicant has lived in State 1 his whole life. The shipyard where he worked from \n2008 to 2017 is located in State 2, within commuting distance. In 2013 and 2014, he kept \nan apartment in State 2, though he did not formally move there. (Tr. 38-40) \n \n \nThe financial allegations in the SOR concern certain unfiled state and Federal \nincome tax returns, some delinquent state and Federal income tax debt, and other debts \nto private creditors. He disclosed child support debt and past-due state income taxes on \nhis SCA. (GE 1) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($3,137), 1.c ($2,381), and 1.d ($$1,890) concern State 1 tax liens \nissued against Applicant in 2014 and 2015. Applicant denied SOR \u00b6 1.b, stating the debt \nhad been paid; he admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d. He testified that all of these tax debts \nwere resolved through garnishment of his wages. He provided documentation of \n\n \n3 \n \n \ngarnishment orders from State 1, for $4,232 (AE B - AE D) and $6,220 (AE E). He \ntestified that these garnishment orders resolved past-due state income tax debt from tax \nyears 2011-2014. (Tr. 40-44, 49) A current pay stub does not show any current \ngarnishments. (AE H) \n \n \nApplicant testified that his tax issues occurred because he had state income taxes \ntaken out by State 2 when he was working there, even though he was living in State 1. \nHe believes he is owed money from State 2 due to tax overpayments or a tax credit, and \nthat those tax payments should have been directed to State 1. He had an accountant or \ntax preparer, but he said she did not file returns with State 1 for several years (2011-\n2015). (Tr. 44-47) Applicant did not believe that he could have fixed the problem through \nhis employer\u2019s payroll office by telling them to withhold State 1 taxes (because he lived \nthere) even though his work location was in State 2. (Tr. 47-49) He provided an \n\u201cunclaimed property form\u201d from the State 2 Treasurer\u2019s office, which came with a $2,600 \ncheck he received from State 2. He said it was reimbursing him for State 2 taxes that \nwere improperly collected. (Tr. 85-89; AE A) \n \n \nThe SOR also alleges that Applicant has unfiled State 1 income tax returns for tax \nyears 2011 and 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and an unfiled federal income tax return for 2016 as \nwell (SOR \u00b6 1.e). Applicant testified that his 2016 state and federal returns remain \nunfiled but that all earlier years (2011-2015) had been \u201cfiled.\u201d He then clarified that he \nhad signed returns provided to him by his tax preparer, but the returns had not in fact \nbeen \u201cfiled\u201d with State 1. He believes, however, that his tax preparer filed returns with \nState 2, though erroneously. Applicant provided no documentation that any of these \nincome tax returns either Federal or for State 1, have been filed, even belatedly. He said \nhe contacted the IRS about his 2016 return, and claimed to have gotten a filing extension \nto September 2019. (Tr. 49-54) \n \n \nApplicant also acknowledged owing about $8,000 in past-due Federal income \ntaxes. (SOR \u00b6 1.f) He said he was told by the IRS that he had to file all his past-due \nreturns before he could set up a payment plan. This debt is unresolved.  \n \n \nThe remaining accounts in the SOR all concern past-due debts to private \ncreditors. They include: $12,586, in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.g); $11,541, charged off (SOR \u00b6 \n1.h); charged-off credit union account, for $1,194 (SOR \u00b6 1.i);  charged-off account to a \nfurniture store, for $934 (SOR \u00b6 1.j); $317, in collection; (SOR \u00b6 1.k); $6,656 balance due \non a repossessed auto (SOR \u00b6 1.l); $1,228 past-due, $2,674 total balance on a credit \nunion account (SOR \u00b6 1.m); two accounts placed in collection by a satellite or cable TV \nproviders (SOR \u00b6 1.n, for $525, and SOR \u00b6 1.o, for $423); and a $192 debt in collection \nto a power company. (SOR \u00b6 1.p) These debts are reflected on Applicant\u2019s March 2018 \ncredit report. None of these debts, as alleged, have been paid or otherwise resolved. \n(GE 3; Tr. 56-63) \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged that he incurred many of his debts when he was younger \nand did not know any better. He also fell behind on his expenses during the short period \nhe was unemployed between jobs. (July to September 2017) (Tr. 35-36) \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant contacted the credit union related to SOR debts \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.m, but has \nnot set up a payment plan. (Tr. 57) The debt at SOR \u00b6 1.k is for a vehicle. Applicant fell \nbehind on payments and returned the car. He denied the debt on that basis. He has \nmade no further payments. (Tr. 57-58)  \n \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.l, Applicant was unable to make payments when the monthly fee \nincreased, so he returned the car. He was not aware that he owed a deficiency balance \nuntil he saw the debt on his credit report. The debt is unresolved. (Tr. 58-59) Applicant \nhas not made any arrangements to pay, dispute, or resolve the debts at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n, 1.o, \nor 1.p. (Tr. 61)  \n \nApplicant did not recognize the two past-due medical debts alleged. (SOR \u00b6 1.q, \nfor $97, and SOR \u00b6 1.r, for $61) While SOR \u00b6 1.r names the collection agency involved, \nneither debt identifies the medical creditor allegedly involved. (Tr. 62-63)  \n \nApplicant earns about $21 an hour, about $840 a week, not including overtime. \n(AE H) His pay is sometimes sporadic, and he has little to no savings. He has some \nmoney in his company 401k account. (Tr. 64-66) His wife works for a local community \ncollege and is also a student there. (Tr. 68)  \n \nApplicant pays $694 in monthly child support for his two older children ($438 and \n$256). His younger two children live with him. (Tr. 66-67) He and his wife own two luxury \ncars, both used. They pay $595 and $494 a month on each. They bought one of those \ncars in April 2019, for about $25,000. He said that the garnishments for his tax debts \nimpacted his income, and, thus, his ability to pay his other debts. (Tr. 68-69) \n \nApplicant attested that he intends to pay his debts. He has not pursued credit \ncounseling. He has not altered his spending to get his debts under better control. (Tr. 70) \nIf he is given an opportunity to travel to work locations that offer better pay, he will be in a \nbetter position to address his debts. (Tr. 78) \n \n \n \nGuideline E \n \n \nUnder Guideline E, the Government alleges that, when Applicant prepared and \nsubmitted his February 2018 E-QIP application, he deliberately failed to disclose two \nprior arrests, in March 2010 and July 2011, both for carrying a pistol without a permit, in \nanswer to a question about his police record: \u201cHave you EVER been charged with an \noffense involving firearms or explosives.\u201d (SOR \u00b6 2.a) (GE 1) Applicant acknowledged an \nomission by stating \u201cI agree\u201d but said he misunderstood the question. (Answer) \n \n \nApplicant testified that he was only arrested on one occasion. He was arrested \nand charged with eluding the police and carrying a pistol without a permit. He believes it \nwas in 2011. He acknowledged being stopped by the police. He had a weapon, but it \nwas in his car. He did not have the permit on him. When the police stopped his car, he \ngot out and ran. Applicant said he went to court and pleaded guilty to both counts. He \nreceived a year of probation. (Tr. 25, 70-73, 80-81) \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s FBI criminal record and his criminal record in State 1, both part of the \nGovernment\u2019s case, suggest that he was arrested in March 2010 for eluding the police \nand for carrying a pistol without a permit; and that he was also arrested, on the same two \ncharges, in July 2011. (GE 4, GE 5) However, police records Applicant submitted post-\nhearing support his testimony that he was arrested only once on a gun charge (and for \neluding police), in March 2010. (AE F, AE G) \n \n \nApplicant stated his wife prepared his e-QIP for him because he has reading \nproblems. He has never been formally diagnosed with a reading or learning disability, but \nhe said he had problems in school. He said he and his wife went through the e-QIP \nquestions together and she consulted him during the process. He said he told her about \nthe pistol charge and she did not \u201cput that on there\u201d because she forgot. He \nacknowledged responsibility for reporting information on the e-QIP. He denied any intent \nto falsify or to deliberately deceive the Government in failing to disclose any gun charges \non his e-QIP. (Tr. 20-23, 74-79) \n \nUnder questioning, Applicant also acknowledged that the handwritten answers to \neach allegation in the SOR were written by his wife. He said she read him the SOR and \nwrote down his answer to each allegation. He said that it is his handwriting on the \nnotarized page of his SOR response that contains his signature, address and request for \na hearing. (Tr. 76-78) \n \n \nAs to the criminal charges themselves, Applicant said he was \u201cyoung and wild \nback then\u201d and \u201cbeing stupid.\u201d He has matured and is a family man. He enjoys spending \ntime with his children. (Tr. 89-90) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance, or, as here, to \na determination of public trust. As the Supreme Court noted in Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \n[and trustworthiness] determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable [trustworthiness] decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nI find that AG \u00b6 16(a) is not established. First, I conclude, based on Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony and the documentary evidence, that Applicant was arrested on one occasion,  \nrelated to a gun charge, not twice, as alleged. The arrest seems to have occurred in \nMarch 2010 (when he was also charged with eluding the police). Second, and more \nimportantly, whenever the offense occurred, I do not believe Applicant deliberately failed \nto disclose it on his e-QIP. He listed two large delinquent debts in disclosing details \nabout his financial record, so he knew he was required to disclose derogatory \ninformation. Applicant also credibly testified that he has problems reading, and that his \nwife assisted him in answering both the SOR and the e-QIP. While it is not entirely clear \n\n \n7 \n \n \nwhy Applicant\u2019s one gun charge was not disclosed on the form, I do not believe the \nomission was deliberate. AG \u00b6 16(a) does not apply, and SOR \u00b6 2.a is found for \nApplicant.  \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is \nset out in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise sensitive information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nsensitive information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding sensitive classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise financial trustworthiness concerns. \nThe following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently file annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \n \n \nApplicant has a history of delinquent debts and tax problems. He incurred several \ndelinquent debts when he was younger, and his expenses have outpaced his income for \nseveral years. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c) apply.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nTwo debts are not established. The small medical debts at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.q and 1.r, \nwhich Applicant denied and said he does not recognize, are not sufficiently identified so \nthat Applicant can attempt to resolve them. As medical debts, they are also likely \nattributable to a reasonable circumstance. I resolve them for Applicant.  \n \n \nApplicant lives in State 1 but often worked in State 2 in recent years. This led to a \nmisunderstanding about his state tax filing requirements and state tax payment \nrequirements. State 1 issued several garnishment orders against him to collect the \nunpaid state taxes. He failed to file his 2011 State 1 income tax return, and his 2016 \nState 1 and federal income tax returns. Applicant also has about $8,000 in past-due \nfederal income taxes from tax year 2016. AG \u00b6 19(f) also applies.  \n \nThe financial considerations guideline also includes potentially applicable \nmitigating conditions, under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \nApplicant has a long history of financial delinquencies and tax problems. His debts \nwere perhaps increased due to his brief period of unemployment, but he has also had \nfinancial problems since well before then. Most of his debts are ongoing and unresolved, \nboth debts to private creditors and federal income tax debt. The state tax debts appear \nresolved, but only because State 1 garnished his wages. Applicant has yet to address \nhis debts or to curtail his spending in any meaningful way. He has not contacted his \ncreditors to attempt to resolve his debts, nor has he begun to put together a plan, let \nalone a reasonable plan, for dealing with them. His taxes are unresolved, both state and \nfederal, and he has at least one year (2016) of unfiled tax returns, probably more. No \nmitigating conditions apply. His financial issues remain a trustworthiness concern.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a trustworthiness determination by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \ndetermination of public trust must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis.  \n \n \nI observed Applicant\u2019s demeanor during the hearing. I found him to be a credible \nwitness. Applicant rebutted the personal conduct allegations about disclosure of his \ncriminal history from many years ago. However, his finances remain unstable. He needs \nto establish more of a track record of financial stability and responsibility before he can \nbe considered a suitable candidate for access to sensitive information. The record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor access to sensitive information. For all these reasons, I conclude that Applicant did \nnot mitigate the financial trustworthiness concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.p: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.q-1.r:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:   \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n10 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational security interests of the United States to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nsensitive information. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \n \n \n_____________________________ \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on June 6, 2016. On \nFebruary 25, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuidelines B and F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 31, 2019, and requested a decision on \nthe written record without a hearing. On July 3, 2019, the Government sent Applicant a \ncomplete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), including \ndocuments identified as Items 1 through 7. She was given an opportunity to submit a \ndocumentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or \n\n \n2 \n \nexplanation to the Government\u2019s evidence. She received the FORM on August 5, 2019, \nand did not respond. Items 1 and 2 contain the pleadings in the case. Items 3, 5, 6, and \n7 are admitted into evidence. Item 4 is addressed in the \u201cAdministrative Notice\u201d section \nbelow. Applicant\u2019s SOR answer included a document that is marked and admitted into \nevidence as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. The case was assigned to me on October 3, \n2019. \n \nProcedural Matter \n \nI extracted the below findings of facts from Applicant\u2019s SOR Answer (Item 2), her \nSCA (Item 3), and a summary of her security clearance interview (SI) (Item 7). Item 7 \nwas not authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. However, I conclude that \nApplicant waived any objection to Item 7. The Government included in the FORM a \nprominent notice advising Applicant of her right to object to the admissibility of Item 7 on \nthe ground that it was not authenticated. Applicant was also notified that if he did not \nraise any objection to Item 7 in her response to the FORM, or if she did not respond to \nthe FORM, she could be considered to have waived any such objection, and that Item 7 \ncould be considered as evidence in his case. Applicant received the FORM, including a \ncopy of Item 7. She did not respond to the FORM or otherwise object to Item 7. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 36, is a Kenyan citizen by birth. She entered the United States in \n2003. She was married to a U.S. citizen in 2004 and became a U.S. citizen in 2014. She \nhas no children. She filed for divorce in 2017, the status of which was not specified in \nthe record. She earned an associate degree in 2010 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2014 \nfrom U.S. institutions. Applicant has been employed as a design engineer by a U.S. \ndefense contractor since 2015. This is her first application for a DOD security clearance. \n \nGuideline B \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother (age 59) and father (age 69) are Kenyan citizens and \nresidents (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b). They reside in Nairobi, the capital and largest city of \nKenya. Her father is a retired journalist with former affiliations with the Kenyan \nparliament and magistrate courts. Her mother runs a non-government organization \n(NGO). Without specifying which entities fund the NGO, Applicant claimed that her \nmother is not affiliated with any foreign government. She communicates with each of \nher parents weekly. (Item 3 at 25-28; Item 7 at 4) \n \nApplicant has four siblings. Sister 1 (age 34) and Brother 1 (age 31) are Kenyan \ncitizens and residents (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d). They also reside in Nairobi. Sister 2 (age \n31) and Brother 2 (age 27) are Kenyan citizens residing in the United States. Sister 1 is \na legal counsel in the office of the Attorney General of Kenya. Her other siblings are \nstudents. She communicates with Sister 1 and Brother 1 monthly. (Item 3 at 28-33; Item \n7 at 4-5, 11) \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \nApplicant has close and continuing contact with three friends who are Kenyan \ncitizens and residents. (SOR \u00b6 1.e). The record did not specify in which city these \nfriends reside. Friend 1 is employed as a manager by a British multinational investment \nbank and financial services company. Friend 2 is a member of the clergy at a church in \nNairobi. Neither Friend 3\u2019s employment status nor job title was specified in the record. \nShe communicates with her friends monthly. (Item 3 at 36-37, 41-42; Item 7 at 6-8) \n \nApplicant travelled to visit family and friends in Kenya in 2011, 2012, and 2017. \nShe reported \u201cin person\u201d communications with her parents, Sister 1, Brother 1, and \nFriend 1 but did not specify whether they occurred outside of Kenya. Her one in-person \nvisit with Friend 3 occurred in the United States in 2016. (Item 3 at 9, 25-31, 36-37, 47-\n48; Item 7 at 8)  \n \nApplicant has owned a home in the United States since 2010. She is now renting \na home in another state, while Sister 2 and Brother 2 reside there. The record did not \nspecify what, if any, equity Applicant has in the home, or whether she owns any other \nU.S. assets. She co-owns with her mother a dormant bank account, with a $0 balance, \nin Kenya. She does not maintain any other foreign financial interests. (Item 3 at 10, 43-\n44; Item 7 at 3, 10-11) \n \nApplicant sent approximately $500 per month to her mother over an unspecified \nnumber of years for her financial support and to assist in paying school fees for her \nsiblings. As of 2017, she sent a total amount of approximately $10,000. It was \nunspecified in the record whether, in what amount, and for how long she intended to \ncontinue sending money to her mother. (Item 3 at 44-45; Item 7 at 11)   \n \nGuideline F \n \n \nApplicant has nine unresolved delinquent debts totaling approximately $32,010 \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a through 2.i). She denied all but one of them in her SOR answer, without \nexplanation. Applicant claimed that her one admitted debt (SOR \u00b6 2.c/$461) would be \nsettled by April 2019, without providing any documentary proof. While one debt (SOR \u00b6 \n2.g/$3,003) showed a $0 balance on her January 2019 credit report, it was not reported \ntherein as paid. (Item 5 and 6) \n \nApplicant stated, without further explanation, that she fell behind on payments to \ncertain creditors during an unspecified period due to being \u201coverwhelmed with debt.\u201d \nShe also stated that during her last two years of college, she fell behind on her home \nmortgage payment and it went into collections. That mortgage is now in good standing \nand was not alleged in the SOR. In November 2018, Applicant described her overall \nfinancial situation as \u201cokay\u201d and averred that she was meeting her financial obligations \non time \u201cfor the most part.\u201d (AE A; Item 7 at 11-12)  \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nAdministrative Notice (Kenya) \n \nI have taken administrative notice of the U.S. Government\u2019s pronouncements \nconcerning Kenya, as outlined in its Request for Administrative Notice (Item 4) and the \ndocuments appended thereto, including the following: \n \n\uf0b7 Kenya is a republic with three branches of government: an \nexecutive branch, led by a directly elected president; a bicameral \nparliament consisting of the Senate and the National Assembly; \nand a judiciary. (Item 4: Item I at 1) \n \n\uf0b7 There is considerable risk from terrorism in Nairobi. Terrorism \nremains a high priority concern. The U.S. government continues to \nreceive information regarding potential terrorist threats aimed at \nU.S., Western, and Kenyan interests in the Nairobi area, counties \nbordering Somalia, and in the coastal areas including Mombasa \nand Malindi. (HE I at 2) \n \n\uf0b7 Kenya is a strong U.S. partner in counterterrorism investigation, \nprosecution, and incident response, and continued to play an \nimportant role in regional counterterrorism cooperation. Reports of \nhuman rights violations by security forces during counterterrorism \noperations continued, including allegations of extra-judicial killings, \ndisappearances, and torture. Coordination among the Kenyan \ngovernmental agencies with counterterrorism functions was \nuneven, with improved information sharing in some cases and \nfailure to appropriately pass threat information in others. Overall, \nresource constraints, insufficient training, corruption, and unclear \ncommand and control hindered effectiveness. (Item 4: Item IV at \n24-25, 26) \n \n\uf0b7 Despite public progress in fighting corruption, the Kenyan \ngovernment does not implement relevant laws effectively, and \nofficials frequently engaged in alleged corrupt practices with \nimpunity. Bribery is the most commonly reported type of corruption. \nPolice corruption remains a significant problem. (Item 4: Item I at \n29-30) \n \n\uf0b7 Human rights issues with the Kenyan government include: unlawful \nand politically motivated killings; forced disappearances; torture; \nharsh and life-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary arrest and \ndetention; an inefficient judiciary; arbitrary infringement of citizens\u2019 \nprivacy rights; censorship; lack of accountability in many cases \ninvolving violence against women, including rape and female \ngenital mutilation/cutting; and criminalization of same-sex sexual \nconduct. (Item 4: Item I at 1) \n\n \n5 \n \nI sua sponte admitted to the record, as HE I, the following updated source \ndocument cited in Item 4: Item III, updated March 14, 2019. The updated website \naddress is https://www.osac.gov/Country/Kenya/Content/Detail/Report/03c822af-2922-\n4a4c-ba8b-15f4aead1599 (note that this document was available at the time Item 4 was \nsubmitted in June 2019). I also sua sponte amended page 5 of Item 4 to correct a \ntypographical error in the list of source documents, thereby changing the date from \nMarch 29, 2018 to April 9, 2019. Because these sua sponte actions did not affect either \nthe relative positions of the parties or my decision, prior notice to the parties was not \nrequired. \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. \n\n \n6 \n \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at \n3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition \nby substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. \n(ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \n \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) is set out in AG \u00b6 6, \nas follows: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe following are potentially relevant disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \nand \n \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's \nobligation to protect classified or sensitive information or technology and \nthe individual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information or technology.  \n\n \n7 \n \nApplicant\u2019s ties to family and friends, who are Kenyan citizens and residents, \nestablish AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b). A heightened risk is associated with Kenya given the \nterrorism, human rights issues, and government corruption existent there. Applicant \nbears the burden of persuasion to mitigate these concerns. ISCR Case No. 99-0532 at \n7 (App. Bd. Dec. 15, 2000). Applicant\u2019s ties to Sister 2 and Brother 2, who do not reside \nin Kenya, and her dormant bank account in Kenya, do not establish any disqualifying \ncondition under Guideline B. \n \nApplication of the guidelines is not a comment on an applicant\u2019s patriotism but \nmerely an acknowledgment that people may act in unpredictable ways when faced with \nchoices that could be important to a loved one, such as a family member. ISCR Case \nNo. 08-10025 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2009). Family relationships can involve matters of \ninfluence or obligation. ISCR Case No. 02-04786 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2003)  \n \nThe following are potentially relevant mitigating conditions under this guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States;  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, \nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interest; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nApplicant maintains strong familial ties with her parents, Sister 1, and Brother 1; \nand close and continuing contact with her Friends 1, 2, and 3. Her father\u2019s former \naffiliation and her sister\u2019s current affiliation with the Kenyan government create \nadditional vulnerabilities. Regardless of any such affiliations, there remains a \nheightened risk associated with Kenya. Under these circumstances, I cannot conclude \nthat it is unlikely that Applicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between \nthe interests of her family and close friends and that of the United States, or that \nApplicant has met her burden to mitigate the Guideline B concern. AG \u00b6 8(a) is not \nestablished. \n \nApplicant has established strong ties to the United States, where she has resided \nfor 16 years. She earned two degrees from U.S. institutions, and has owned a home in \nthe United States for 10 years. Two of her siblings reside in the United States. However, \n\n \n8 \n \nthe record contains insufficient facts to overcome the equally strong ties that she has to \nher family and friends in Kenya, who are vulnerable to a foreign government known for \nproblems with terrorism and for its corruption and human rights violations. Under these \ncircumstances, I cannot conclude that Applicant could be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. AG \u00b6 8(b) is not established. \n \nNone of Applicant\u2019s familial or close-friend relationships are casual; nor is her \ncontact with them infrequent. There remains a potential risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation. AG \u00b6 8(c) is not established. \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) is set out in \nAG \u00b6 18, as follows: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012))  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s significant unresolved delinquent debts, corroborated by the credit \nreports, establish two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability \nto satisfy debts); and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations).  \n \n \nApplicant has not provided sufficient evidence to support any of the following \npotentially applicable mitigating factors: AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long \nago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment); AG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear victimization by \npredatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances); and AG \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). Therefore, I conclude \n\n \n9 \n \nthat Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by her financial \nindebtedness.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, an administrative judge \nshould consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines B and F in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors AG \u00b6 2(d). I weighed the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline B and F, and evaluated all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person and the heightened risk associated with Kenya. Applicant \nhas not mitigated the security concerns raised by her ties to citizens and residents of \nKenya, or her financial indebtedness. Accordingly, I conclude that she has not carried \nher burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.i:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

DOD acted under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines effective June 8, 2017 (AG). \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 15, 2019, and elected to have her \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted \nthe Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) on May 23, 2019. The evidence \nincluded in the FORM is identified as Items 2-6 (Item 1 includes pleadings and \ntransmittal information). The FORM was mailed to Applicant, who received it on June 4, \n2019. Applicant was given an opportunity to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not file objections or submit \n\n \n2 \n \nevidence. Items 2-6 are admitted without objection. The case was assigned to me on \nJuly 18, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.bb). Her admissions \nare incorporated as findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She has worked for \nthis employer since July 2016. She was unemployed from September to November \n2015. She is a high school graduate and has earned some college credits. She married \nin 1998 and has one minor child. (Items 2-3) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant filed for bankruptcy in 2010 and owed 25 delinquent \ndebts totaling approximately $46,152. The debts included a repossessed vehicle, \nconsumer debts, and medical debts. The allegations are supported by credit reports \nfrom November 2017, December 2018, and May 2019; her answers to questions from a \ndefense investigator in April 2018 (PSI); and admissions in her SOR answer. Her \nanswer claimed that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.s, and 1.t are all from the same underlying debt. \nCredit report information supports her assertion. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.s and 1.t are resolved in \nfavor of Applicant. Additionally, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l-1.n and 1.p-1.q are medical debts that do \nnot name a specific creditor. Those allegations provide insufficient notice to Applicant \nregarding the nature of those debts. They are resolved in favor of Applicant. (Items 1-6) \n \n \nApplicant explained that she got behind on her debts because of her \nunderemployment (making hourly wages) and medical issues in 2000. She also claimed \nher husband, who is also an hourly wage earner, lost his job several times before four \nyears ago when he secured a better job. She was the sole wage earner during his \nunemployment. She then lost her job in the fall of 2015. Thereafter, she started her own \nbusiness, using credit cards to finance it. That business failed leaving her with a large \ndebt. She claims that she has made arrangements to pay the medical debts listed in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.x-1.bb, but she failed to provide supporting documentation. As for the \nremaining debts, she did not provide any documentation showing that she had paid any \nof the debts, or that she had entered into any payment agreements with any creditors. \nApplicant did not provide any information about her current financial situation or a \nbudget. Other than the debts resolved as described above, her remaining debts are \nunresolved. (Items 1 (answer), 3) \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \n\n \n3 \n \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable trustworthiness \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG & 18 expresses the trustworthiness concern for financial considerations:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \ntrustworthiness concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, \nincluding espionage. \n\n \n4 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. \nI have considered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant had debts discharged through a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2010 and \nincurred 25 delinquent debts that remain unpaid. I find both of the above disqualifying \nconditions are raised.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nNone of the above mitigating conditions fully apply. Both Applicant and her \nhusband had periods of unemployment and she experienced medical issues, but she \nfailed to present evidence that she acted responsibly in addressing her delinquent \ndebts. She presented no evidence of taking any action to contact creditors, set up \npayment plans, or pay the debts. There is no evidence of financial counseling. She \nfailed to establish a track record of financial responsibility. Duplicate debts and \nunnamed medical debts are resolved in favor of Applicant. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for access to \nsensitive information must be an overall commonsense assessment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.       \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s and her husband\u2019s unemployment and her medical \nissues. However, Applicant failed to produce evidence of any action taken to address \nher delinquent debts.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for access to sensitive information. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations \ntrustworthiness concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.k:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.l \u2013 1.n:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph   1.o:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.p \u2013 1.q:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph   1.r:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.s \u2013 1.t:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.u \u2013 1.bb:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with national \nsecurity to grant Applicant eligibility for access to sensitive information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted to all the allegations of the SOR. However, the Government withdrew \u00b6\u00b6 1.j., and 1.1.k. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 33-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been employed with the defense contractor for 15 months. (TR at page 15 line 7 to page 18 line 1.) He is married, and has two children. (Id.)

The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 10, 2019, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on July 2, 2019. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on July 9, \n2019, scheduling the hearing for August 13, 2019. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 4, which were admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. Applicant offered one set of \ndocuments, which I marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AppX) A, and admitted into evidence. \nThe record was left open until September 13, 2019, for receipt of additional \n\n \n2 \n \ndocumentation. Applicant offered nothing further; and as such, the record was closed on \nthat date.

However, the Government \nwithdrew \u00b6\u00b6 1.j., and 1.1.k. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been \nemployed with the defense contractor for 15 months. (TR at page 15 line 7 to page 18 \nline 1.) He is married, and has two children. (Id.)

This allegation is found against Applicant. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \n\n \n4 \n \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n\n \n5 \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n  \nApplicant has significant past-due indebtedness. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nNone of these apply. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. He has a long \nhistory of delinquencies. He has not demonstrated that future financial problems are \nunlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has not been established. Financial Considerations is \nfound against Applcant. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial \nConsiderations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c~i: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nSubparagraphs 1.j. and 1.k: \n \nWithdrawn \n \nSubparagraphs 1.l~q: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on April 15, 2016. On \nApril 30, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuidelines F and E. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (December 10, 2016). \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 25, 2019, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on June 28, 2019, and \n\n \n2 \n \nthe case was assigned to me on July 23, 2019. On August 7, 2019, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for \nAugust 28, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \nthrough 13 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified but did not \npresent the testimony of any other witnesses or any documentary evidence. I kept the \nrecord open until September 13, 2019, to enable him to present documentary evidence. \nHe timely submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through D, which were admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on September 9, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, \n1.e-1.h, and 2.c. He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, 1.i-1.l, 2.a, 2.b, and 2.d. \nHis admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old senior systems administrator employed by a defense \ncontractor since March 2017. He has held a security clearance since September 1996. \n \nApplicant married in May 2004 and separated in 2017. (Tr. 19.) He and his wife \nhave two children, ages 13 and 19, who live with Applicant. (Tr. 56.)  \n \nApplicant served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from February 1996 to \nDecember 1999. In December 1997, he received nonjudicial punishment for unauthorized \nabsence and making a false official statement. He received a suspended reduction in \nrank, forfeiture of $50 pay, and 15 days of extra duty. (GX 12 at 7.) In late 1998, he was \nconvicted by a general court-martial of wrongful use of cocaine. He was reduced to the \nlowest enlisted rank, restricted to the limits of his duty station, and ordered to perform \nhard labor without confinement for 45 days. (GX 12 at 4.) In June 1999, he was \nadministratively discharged for misconduct and received a general discharge under \nhonorable conditions. (GX 12 at 2.)  \n \nThe record does not reflect Applicant\u2019s employment history from June 1999 to July \n2007. He worked for non-government employers from August 2007 to September 2013. \nHe worked for another defense contractor from September 2013 to March 2016, and was \nterminated for chronic tardiness. In his SCA, he stated that he left this employer because \nhis contract ended. At the hearing, he admitted that he knew he had been fired, and he \nadmitted that he falsified his SCA when he stated that he left this job because his contract \nended. (Tr. 35.) \n \nApplicant worked for another defense contractor from April to November 2016, and \nhe was fired for submitting a fraudulent information technology (IT) certification. (GX 2; \nGX 11) He denied that he submitted a fraudulent certificate, and explained that he simply \nsubmitted his previous expired certification. (Tr. 21-23.) He was unemployed from \nNovember 2016 until he was hired for his current job. (GX 1 at 10.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant testified that he had three surgeries for herniated disks in his back \nbetween 2003 and 2012, and he was prescribed opiate medications following his surgery. \nHe believed that he became addicted to opiates, but he was unable to obtain professional \nhelp in overcoming his addiction, because he was using the opiates in accordance with \nhis prescriptions. He stopped taking the medications in 2017, because they adversely \naffected his work, his financial situation, and his marriage. (Tr. 23-31.) He provided no \ndocumentation to support his testimony. \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 12 delinquent debts reflected in credit reports from June 2019, \nJanuary 2019, November 2017, and June 2016 (GX 3-6), and various court records (GX \n7-10). The evidence concerning these debts is summarized below. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: judgment for $1,805, filed in 2014. Applicant testified that he was \nunaware of this judgment when he submitted his SCA, and he had not made any recent \nefforts to identify it. (Tr. 35-36; GX 7.) It is not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: judgment for $1,884, filed in 2015. Applicant testified that he believes \nthis judgment is for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f and that the original creditor was a \ndentist. (Tr. 37; GX 8.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: judgment for $961, filed in 2017 and satisfied by garnishment. This \ndebt was for homeowners\u2019 association dues, and it was satisfied by garnishment of \nApplicant\u2019s bank account in June 2018. (GX 9.) It was incurred because Applicant and \nhis wife each thought that the other was paying it. (Tr. 39.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: home-mortgage loan past due for $3,030, with a balance of \n$223,668. Applicant testified that this loan became delinquent because he and his wife \nwere separated, and each believed that the other was making the payments. (Tr. 14) He \nfell behind in April 2016. He contacted the lender and applied for hardship assistance, \nwhich was granted, and his monthly payments were reduced. (GX 13 at 5.) He testified \nthat he has been making regular payments and the account is current. (Tr. 42.) The June \n2019 credit report reflects that the payments were current when the debt was transferred \nto another lender in April 2019. (GX 3 at 3.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: medical debt placed for collection of $2,223. This debt was placed \nfor collection in July 2017. (GX 4 at 2.) The creditor obtained a judgment against Applicant \nfor this debt in March 2019. (GX 10.) Applicant paid it in full on August 29, 2019. (AX A.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: charge account placed for collection of $2,298. On September 14, \n2018, Applicant made a payment agreement providing for monthly $50 payments. As of \nSeptember 3, 2019, his balance due on this debt was $1,698. Although Applicant testified \nthat he thought this debt might be a dental bill, his documentation reflects that the original \ncreditor is a discount department store. (GX 3 at 1; AX C.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: medical debt placed for collection of $543. Applicant paid this debt \nin full on August 30, 2019. (AX B.) \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i: medical debts placed for collection of $190 and $166. \nApplicant paid these debts in full on September 13, 2019. (AX D.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j: credit-card account charged off for $3,859 in July 2013. This debt \nis not being resolved. Applicant testified that he was making monthly $50 payments on \nthis debt, but his documentation of the monthly payments reflects that the payments were \nfor the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f. (Tr. 47.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.l: collection accounts for $638 and $489. Applicant testified \nthat both collection accounts were for medical bills and that they have been paid in full. \n(Tr. 48.) He did not provide any documentation supporting his testimony.  \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his SCA in April 2017, he answered \u201cNo\u201d to a question, \n\u201cHave you EVER been charged with an offense involving alcohol or drugs?\u201d (Capital \nletters were used for emphasis in the SCA.) He did not disclose that he was charged with \nwrongful use of cocaine and convicted by a court-martial in 1998. (GX 1 at 26.) When he \nwas interviewed by a security investigator in August 2017, he voluntarily disclosed his \nnonjudicial punishment, but he did not disclose his court-martial conviction until he was \nconfronted with the evidence.  He told the investigator that he did not disclose the \nconviction in his SCA because it was embarrassing. (GX 13 at 8.) At the hearing, he \ntestified that he did not disclose the conviction because he did not understand the \nquestion in the SCA. (Tr. 15.) \n \n \nApplicant also answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question in the SCA asking if he had any \njudgments entered against him in the last seven years. (GX 1 at 30.) He testified that he \nwas unaware of the judgments alleged in the SOR when he submitted his SCA. (Tr. 33.) \nHe became aware of the judgment for homeowners\u2019 association dues when his bank \naccount was garnished in June 2018 to satisfy the judgment. (Tr. 39-40.)  \n \nApplicant also answered \u201cNo\u201d to the questions in the SCA about delinquencies \ninvolving routine accounts during the last seven years. (GX 1 at 30.) When asked why he \ndid not disclose any of his delinquent debts, he responded, \u201cI don\u2019t really have an answer \nfor that.\u201d (Tr. 34.) His answer to this question in the SCA is not alleged in the SOR. \n \n \nApplicant currently earns $102,000 per year. (Tr. 20.) He has about $8,000 in a \nsavings account and about $28,000 in retirement accounts. (Tr. 53-54.) He hired a law \nfirm to dispute some of his debts, but he has never sought or obtained financial \ncounseling. (Tr. 51.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \n\n \n5 \n \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he believed the judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.b duplicated the dental bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f. He submitted no documentation to \nsupport his belief. The court records reflect that the creditor who obtained the judgment \nis a bank, likely the issuer for a credit-card account. Applicant\u2019s documentation in AX C \nreflects that the original creditor for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f is a discount department \nstore. The judgment in SOR \u00b6 1.b was filed in April 2015, and the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.f was referred for collection in July 2017. (GX 3 at 1; GX 8.) Applicant has not \nestablished that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.f are duplicates. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence submitted at the hearing \nestablish two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy \ndebts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following \nmitigating conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n\n \n7 \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s marital breakup in 2017 was a \ncondition largely beyond his control, and it apparently contributed to the past-due home-\nmortgage payments and delinquent homeowners\u2019 association dues. He acted responsibly \nregarding the past-due mortgage payments, but not the delinquent association dues, \nwhich were collected by garnishment. His involuntary discharge from the Air Force, \ntermination of employment for tardiness, and termination for submitting a false IT \ncertification were not conditions largely beyond his control, but rather the consequences \nof his derelictions and misconduct. Opiate addiction would qualify as a condition largely \nbeyond his control, but he has not provided corroborating evidence to support his claim \nof opiate addiction.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant has not sought or received financial \ncounseling. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.f. Applicant \nwas current on his mortgage payments when the mortgage was sold to another lender in \nApril 2019. He began making regular monthly payments on the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f \nin September 2018, well before the SOR was issued.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established for the judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, because it \nwas resolved by involuntary garnishment. Payment by involuntary garnishment, \u201cis not \nthe same as, or similar to, a good-faith initiation of repayment by the debtor.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 09-05700 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2011).  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.h, and 1.i. \nAlthough they have been paid in full, they were not paid until August and September \n2019, after the hearing. Evidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of \n\n \n8 \n \ndebts only under pressure of qualifying for a security clearance. Applicants who begin to \naddress their security-significant conduct only when their personal interests are at stake \nmay be lacking in judgment and reliability. ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, \n2018).  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant admitted all the debts in his response to \nthe SOR. The credit report from January 2019 reflects that Applicant disputed this debt, \nbut the record does not reflect the basis for the dispute, and the debt has been resolved. \nApplicant could not identify some of the debts at the hearing, but he has not disputed \nthem. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant deliberately falsified his SCA by failing to disclose \nthat he was charged with and convicted of wrongful use of cocaine while on active duty \nin the Air Force (SOR \u00b6 2.a); by failing to disclose the judgments entered against him \n(SOR \u00b6 2.b); and by failing to disclose that he had been fired from a job in March 2016 \n(SOR \u00b6 2.c). It also alleges that he falsified material facts during an interview with a \nsecurity investigator in August 2017 by failing to disclose that he had been fired from a \njob in November 2016 (SOR \u00b6 2.d). \n \nApplicant could not explain why he answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question in his SCA \nasking if he had any delinquencies other than the judgments. Although his negative \nanswer was false, it is not alleged in the SOR. Conduct not alleged in the SOR may not \nbe used as an independent basis for denying or revoking a security clearance, but it may \nbe considered to assess an applicant=s credibility; to decide whether a particular \nadjudicative guideline is applicable; to evaluate evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or \nchanged circumstances; to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful \nrehabilitation; or as part of a whole-person analysis. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. \nBd. Oct. 26, 2006). I have considered Applicant\u2019s answer to this question in the SCA for \nthese limited purposes. \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions are: \n \nAG \u00b616(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \n\n \n9 \n \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \nAG \u00b616(b): deliberately providing false or misleading information; or \nconcealing or omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an \nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity eligibility determination, or other official government representative. \n \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the Government has \nthe burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An \nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). An applicant\u2019s experience and level of education are relevant \nto determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information on a security clearance \napplication was deliberate. ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). \n \n \nI found Applicant\u2019s explanation for not disclosing the judgments against him \nplausible and convincing. He demonstrated repeatedly during the hearing that he did not \nhave a good grasp of his financial situation. His marital break-up contributed to his \nconfusion about joint obligations. However, he has not given plausible and convincing \nexplanations for not disclosing that he was charged with and convicted of a drug offense \nand not disclosing that he was fired in November 2016. He admitted that he falsified his \nSCA by not disclosing that he was fired in March 2016. I conclude that SOR \u00b6 2.b is not \nestablished, but SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.c, and 2.d are established and are sufficient to raise the \ndisqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b). \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable. \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. \n \n \nAG 17(a) is not established. When Applicant was interviewed by a security \ninvestigator in August 2017, he disclosed his nonjudicial punishment, but denied that he \nhad any further criminal conduct while in the Air Force. He did not disclose his conviction \nfor wrongful use of cocaine until he was confronted with the evidence. (GX 13 at 7.) He \nalso denied that he was involuntarily terminated in March 2016. (GX 13 at 6.) He was \ninterviewed again in November 2018 regarding his employment record, and he denied \nbeing fired for submitting a forged IT certification. Instead, he told the investigator that he \nwas terminated because he lacked the required certification. (GX 13 at 12.) \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(b) is not established. Applicant\u2019s falsifications in his SCA were not minor. \nFalsification of an SCA \u201cstrikes at the heart of the security clearance process.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 09-01652 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2011.) His falsifications were recent because they \npertained to his current application for a security clearance. They did not occur under \nunique circumstances making them unlikely to recur. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and E, and evaluating all the evidence in \nthe context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his delinquent debts and lack of candor during the security-clearance \nprocess. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c, 1.e, and 1.g-1.l:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d and 1.f: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a, 2.c, and 2.d:  \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

National \nsecurity eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \nHistory of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on June 9, 2016. On \nFebruary 8, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). Applicant \nanswered the SOR on March 8, 2019, and requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge (Answer).  \n \nI was assigned to the case on April 4, 2019. On April 12, 2019, the Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for \nMay 14, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 5 were admitted without objection. Applicant and his wife testified, and Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AE) A through E were admitted without objection. I received the transcript (Tr.) \non May 22, 2019. The record was held open until June 7, 2019, to allow Applicant to \nsubmit additional documents. He timely submitted AE F through R, which were admitted \nwithout objection, and the record closed. \n \n \n \n\n \n2 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 54 years old. He has been married to his wife for over 27 years, and \nthey have two children, ages 24 and 20. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2015. He has \nworked for a state university (SU) as a network engineer since 2001, and he has \ncontinuously held a security clearance in this position. (GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 10-12, 15) \n \nIn 2004, just before the housing-market bubble burst, Applicant purchased two \ntownhomes as investment properties. They each cost less than $90,000. After he \npurchased the properties, the townhome complex became flooded with other investors, \nand the community deteriorated. As the neighborhood went downhill, it became more and \nmore difficult for him to rent the properties. The renters he was able to find paid late, failed \nto pay, and damaged the properties. Additionally, the rent he collected was less than his \nmonthly mortgage payments. Within a few years, the community pool, clubhouse, and \ntennis courts were closed due to a lack of sufficient homeowners\u2019 association dues and \nessential maintenance. Applicant was unable to sell or short-sell the properties. (Answer; \nGE 1 at 37-39; GE 2 at 5-6; Tr. 16-17, 25-29, 32-35) \n \nEventually, it became unsustainable for Applicant to maintain the properties and \npay the mortgages. He stopped making the monthly mortgage payments in March 2011, \nand the properties were repossessed by the creditors in July and September 2011. (GE \n2 at 5-6; Tr. 16-17, 25-29, 35) \n \nIn addition to the debt associated with the investment properties, Applicant and his \nwife had other unalleged financial issues related to her former business, which operated \nfrom 2006 to 2008. The business had a negative impact on their finances as she used \ntheir personal credit to support the business. This business began failing at about the \nsame time that Applicant and his wife struggled to make payments for their investment \nproperties. The debts associated with the former business have been resolved. (Tr. 39-\n41) \n \nIn 2011, Applicant received an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 1099-C, \nCancellation of Debt and an IRS Form 1099-A, Acquisition or Abandonment of Secured \nProperty for the respective investment properties. The 1099-C cancelled an $18,152 debt \nfor Property A. The 1099-A showed that Applicant\u2019s mortgage for Property B was \n$84,000, and the townhome was worth less than $66,000. Applicant filed his 2011 state \nand Federal income tax returns in March 2013. He then entered into a payment \narrangement with the IRS to resolve the tax obligations for both properties. Applicant \nmade $350 monthly payments for three years and resolved the $13,000 tax debt. In \nJanuary 2015, he entered into an installment agreement with the IRS for tax years 2012 \nand 2013. The 2011 tax debt delayed his ability to pay his taxes for subsequent tax years. \nHis tax documents show these tax years have been resolved. (Answer; AE B; AE L; AE \nM; AE O; AE R; Tr. 29, 36-37) \n \nIn 2014, Applicant\u2019s mislaid his tax documents. Through his tax preparer, he filed \nfor extensions for tax years 2014 and 2015, but did not file the returns when the \nextensions expired. The tax issues \u201ccascaded\u201d in conjunction with the family-related \n\n \n3 \n \nproblems mentioned above, as a result he failed to file his 2015 through 2017 income tax \nreturns. He never intended not to pay his taxes, and always recognized that he had an \nobligation to file his income tax returns and pay his income taxes. Applicant testified that \nhe should have been more diligent in addressing his outstanding income taxes. (Answer; \nGE 1 at 36; GE 2 at 4, 6-7; Tr. 25, 30-31, 43-45, 49-50) \n \nIn 2014, Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law moved in with his family due to suffering from \nmetastatic breast cancer. She passed away in their home in October 2015. In addition to \nproviding support for their then minor children, Applicant and his wife also provided some \nfinancial support to her late mother. Applicant\u2019s wife was diagnosed with breast cancer in \n2016, and had a double mastectomy in June 2016. The same weekend of his wife\u2019s \nsurgery, their youngest son\u2019s best friend killed himself. In October 2016, Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s \ngrandmother passed away as well. All of these family issues were overwhelming to \nApplicant and his family and contributed to his failure to address his tax obligations in a \ntimely manner. (Answer; Tr. 37, 39-40, 46-47, 50-53, 71) \n \nIn October 2018, Applicant received DOD financial interrogatories. As a result of \nreceiving the interrogatories, Applicant looked for the missing 2014 documents and \nultimately found them in storage unit he had rented for his brother-in-law. In response to \nthe interrogatories, his accountant helped him complete the 2014 to 2017 state and \nfederal income tax returns, and Applicant mailed them to the appropriate authorities on \nDecember 4, 2018. (Answer; GE 3; Tr. 31, 43, 45, 49-50, 54-60) \n \nIn March 2019, Applicant, with the assistance of his accountant, entered into a \npayment agreement with the IRS. In May 2019, Applicant made a lump-sum payment of \n$9,941.17 to the IRS, which resolved tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017. He then entered \ninto a modified agreement with the IRS to make monthly payments of $200 to resolve the \n$11,211 balance for tax year 2014. (AE B; AE C; AE D; AE N; Tr. 22-24, 60-61) \n \nApplicant\u2019s accountant filed for an extension for tax year 2018 in a timely manner. \nAfter the hearing, Applicant provided proof that his 2018 state and Federal income tax \nreturns were filed and paid. He intends to resolve his outstanding IRS tax debt as soon \nas possible. Applicant\u2019s state taxes are current and paid. He has no outstanding obligation \nfor any state tax year. Applicant credibly testified that he will never fail to file his income \ntax returns again. Applicant provided an updated credit report and copies of his most \nrecent utility bills. He pays his bills in a timely manner and has no new delinquent debts. \n(AE A; AE E; AE F; AE H; AE I; AE K; AE P; AE Q; Tr. 40, 61-65, 72-73, 75) \n \nApplicant and his wife have not attended credit counseling, but they have been \nworking with their accountant to resolve their tax issues. Collectively, Applicant and his \nwife collectively earn between $159,000 and $169,000 annually. They have $24,000 in \nsavings and checking accounts, and their retirement accounts total $420,000. They \npurchased their home in 2001 and paid off the mortgage in March 2018, and he drives a \n12-year-old car. Applicant does not live beyond his means. They have the financial means \nto make the IRS payments and intend to resolve this debt as soon as possible. (AE I; Tr. \n16, 67-70, 74-76) \n \n\n \n4 \n \nApplicant submitted a 2018 performance evaluation, in which he is described as a \nteam player, customer-focused, and diligent. His supervisor described his work as \nexemplary and stated that Applicant responded to an increased workload with \nenthusiasm. Additionally, he found Applicant\u2019s \u201clong term perspective . . . is very \ngrounding\u2026. His technical acumen, always calm presence, an insights make him a \nvaluable member of the . . . team.\u201d (AE G)  \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n\n \n5 \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \n\n \n6 \n \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant does not establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a), because his tax issues \nhave been an ongoing issue since tax year 2011. He did not file his state and Federal \nincome tax returns for tax years 2014 through 2017 in a timely manner due to personal \nand family-related issues. He receives partial mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b) due to \nexperiencing circumstances beyond his control, but he admittedly should have been more \nresponsible in addressing his tax issues. Applicant has not received credit counseling, \nbut he has sought assistance from an accountant to resolve his tax issues. He received \npartial mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(c).  \n \nIn 2004, Applicant purchased two modestly-priced townhomes as investment \nproperties. Due to the global housing crash, he fell behind on his payments, and the \nmortgages were charged off in 2011. The foreclosures on the two investment properties \nwere the result, in part, of circumstances beyond his control. In 2013, Applicant entered \ninto a payment arrangement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to resolve the \nassociated tax consequences, which also impacted his ability to pay his taxes for \nsubsequent tax years. Applicant disclosed these financial issues in his June 2016 SCA \nand during his May 2018 personal subject interview (PSI). Applicant has no outstanding \ndebt related to either townhome, they do not appear on his current credit report, and his \nIRS documents do not reflect an outstanding balance for tax years 2011 through 2013. \n \nPrior to the issuance of the SOR, Applicant filed his state and Federal income tax \nreturns for tax years 2014 through 2017. At the hearing, he demonstrated that he paid his \nstate and Federal income taxes for tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017. He also \ndemonstrated that he filed and paid his 2014 state income taxes. He filed his 2014 federal \nincome tax return and before the hearing he entered into a payment agreement. After the \nhearing, he provided proof that his 2018 state and federal returns were filed and his taxes \nwere paid during his valid extension. Applicant\u2019s past IRS payment arrangements show \na track record of compliance that carries over to his arrangement to pay his 2014 Federal \ntaxes. He \u201cmade a good-faith effort to become in compliance\u201d with his tax and other \nfinancial obligations. Mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and 20(g) was established.  \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. \n \n \nApplicant has held a clearance for approximately 18 years. He experienced \nfinancial issues, and he has been working for several years to resolve these issues. His \nefforts demonstrate the actions of a responsible, reliable, and trustworthy person. I \nconclude Applicant met his burden of proof and persuasion. He mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest of the United States \nto grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted. \n \n \n__________________________ \nCAROLINE E. HEINTZELMAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Attached to her Answer, Applicant included a number of documents. Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments, as well as the contents of the attached documents, are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is a 63-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving as a fraud-prevention specialist with her current employer since April 2012. While Applicant completed three years of high school, she did not complete her education, and she did not receive a diploma. She has never served with the U.S. military. She has never held a security clearance. Applicant was married in 2001 and divorced in 2008. She has three sons, born in 1975, 1978, and 1984.

Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 4, 2017, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted \nan Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security \nClearance Application. On March 13, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \nand modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG), for all covered \nindividuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or \neligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIn a sworn statement, dated March 28, 2019, as well as April 22, 2019, Applicant \nresponded to the SOR and elected to have her case decided on the written record in lieu \nof a hearing. A complete copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was \nmailed to Applicant by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on May 17, \n2019, and she was afforded an opportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections \nand submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, \nApplicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines \napplicable to her case. Applicant received the FORM on May 24, 2019. Applicant \nresponded to the FORM by timely submitting a statement and associated documents, all \nof which were accepted without objection. The case was assigned to me on July 10, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with brief comments, all of the \nfactual allegations pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through \n1.l.). Attached to her Answer, Applicant included a number of documents. Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and comments, as well as the contents of the attached documents, are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 63-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving \nas a fraud-prevention specialist with her current employer since April 2012. While \nApplicant completed three years of high school, she did not complete her education, and \nshe did not receive a diploma. She has never served with the U.S. military.  She has \nnever held a security clearance. Applicant was married in 2001 and divorced in 2008. She \nhas three sons, born in 1975, 1978, and 1984.  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 5 (e-QIP, dated December 4, 2017); Item 7 \n(Combined Experian and TransUnion Credit Report, dated January 12, 2018); Item 6 \n(Equifax Credit Report, dated January 15, 2019); Item 8 (Enhanced Subject Interview, \ndated June 25, 2018); Item 4 (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, dated March 28, 2019, and \nApril 22, 2019); and Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM, dated May 26, 2019. \nApplicant was unemployed from November 2009 until April 2012, during which she \nreceived disability benefits from Medicaid. (Item 8, at 3) She eventually returned to work, \nand contends that she did not have any continuing financial problems by the \ncommencement of 2016. (Item 5, at 32) In 2016, when Applicant was in the process of \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \npurchasing a home, her adult son \u2013 a single father with three daughters \u2013 became ill with \nconstant blackouts, and as a result, he lost his job as a truck driver. Applicant obtained \nloans to assist him, but her efforts plunged her own finances into trouble. She paid his \n$1,050 monthly rent for four months; his $348 monthly automobile loan for one year; and \nabout $700 in expenses for her granddaughters over an unspecified period. (Item 8, at 4) \nIn August 2017, Applicant sought the assistance of a credit-counseling service, but \nshe claims that after paying them an initial contract fee, she became unhappy with their \napproach to resolving her debts. (Item 8, at 4; Item 5, at 32; Response to the FORM)  \nApplicant failed to submit any documents to support her claim that she entered into a \nprofessional relationship with the counseling service; that she made any payment(s) to \nthem; or what exactly the terms of the program were. In November 2017, Applicant \nretained the services of a law firm whose specialty is credit repair, and she sought to have \nher fees and interest charges removed, reduced or dismissed. It was her intention to start \nmaking payments to her creditors only after she received the final negotiated amount for \neach debt. (Item 8, at 4) In August 2018, Appellant sent some of her creditors a letter to \nmotivate them to restructure her debts. Applicant submitted one generic e-mail from the \nlaw firm, dated December 22, 2017, in which she was asked to e-sign the engagement \nagreement. Applicant failed to submit documents to support her claim that she actually \nsigned the engagement agreement; and that the law firm took any actions on her behalf \nwith respect to the creditors.  \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated:  \nI have been trying to deal with larger bills to see what I can afford to pay \nmonthly, as well as settle the smaller ones. Also, I have been working with \n[the law firm] since 2017 to attempt to get all of the fees deleted from the \nbills. All of the creditors were sent letters back in August 2018 to make \narrangements of what I am able to pay. \nIn June 2018, during her interview with an investigator from the U.S. Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM), Applicant claimed to have a net monthly income of \n$3,082; monthly expenses of $2,481; and $601 in total disposable income. She claimed \nto be meeting all of her current financial obligations. (Item 8, at 6-7)  \nWhile Applicant attributed $9,076 to payments made on behalf of her son and \ngranddaughters, the SOR alleges 12 delinquent accounts totaling $40,712, 8 of which \nwere charged off. Several of those accounts were discussed with the OPM investigator, \nand Applicant was requested to furnish documentation associated with her financial \ndelinquencies. She failed to do so during or subsequent to the interview. (Item 8, at 7) \nAlthough Applicant contends that she and several of her creditors entered into settlement \nagreements or repayment agreements; or that she has been making agreed payments to \nsome creditors; or that she has actually paid off several of the accounts, with one \nexception referring to a $50 payment in February 2019, Applicant failed to submit any \ndocuments, including receipts, cancelled checks, or bank account transactions, to support \nher contentions that any accounts have been settled, paid off, or otherwise resolved; that \nany agreed settlements have actually proceeded to resolution; that any payments have \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nactually been made to any creditors; or that the law firm has taken any action to resolve \nany of the accounts. In light of her repeated failures or refusals to furnish such \ndocumentation, there is little evidence that Applicant made any efforts, much less good-\nfaith efforts, to address her delinquent accounts, despite having $601 in total disposable \nincome each month. There is no evidence of financial counseling or a budget. In the \nabsence of additional financial information, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is \ncurrently in a better position financially than she had been.  \nCharacter References \n \n \nTwo friends (including one former colleague) who have known Applicant for over \n23 years are very effusive in their praise for her, describing her as highly professional, \ncompetent, trustworthy, honest, dependable, hardworking, loyal, respected, and \nconsiderate of others. One noted that when Applicant was diagnosed with multiple \nsclerosis many years ago, her sons were constantly at her side while she recovered. \n(Character References attached to Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.)     \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).) \n \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).) \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (id.) \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nThe SOR alleges 12 delinquent accounts totaling $40,712, 8 of which were \ncharged off. Although Applicant claims to have addressed several of the accounts, as \nnoted above, she failed to submit documentation that reflects that any of the delinquent \naccounts have actually been resolved, or that they are in the process of being resolved. \nDespite having $601 in total disposable income each month as of June 2018, she \nsubmitted only one document reflecting that a single $50 payment had been made to a \ncreditor in February 2019. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c) have been established.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) minimally apply. A debt that became delinquent several \nyears ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts \nevidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for \npurposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. \nBd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016).) The \nnature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial difficulties, her failure \nto resolve her delinquent accounts, although she has had the financial ability to start \naddressing them for several years, make it rather easy to conclude that it was not \ninfrequent and it is likely to remain unchanged, much like it has been for the past three \nyears. Applicant has attempted to attribute those debts to her assistance of her son and \nher three grandchildren without any apparent awareness that she was causing financial \nruin to herself. However, in fact, only $9,076 was spent on behalf of her son and \ngranddaughters, and the record is silent as to the reasons why the remaining debts were \ngenerated by her. Inaction or refusal to take timely and appropriate action with respect to \nthe accounts she opened and used indicates irresponsibility toward financial and social \nobligations in general. When an individual with otherwise good credit, such as Applicant \nclaimed she was, fails to make timely account payments, her actions can be interpreted \nas a lack of respect for financial obligations. \n \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, once \nnegotiated reduced balances are established, without further confirmed action, are \ninsufficient.  \n \nIn this instance, to date, there is substantial evidence that no good-faith corrective \nactions have been taken by Applicant, either after she was interviewed by the OPM \ninvestigator in June 2018; after she received the SOR in March 2019; or after she received \nthe FORM in May 2019. There are only her unverified comments claiming that she had \ntaken certain actions. The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to \nclaim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001) \n \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling or a budget. In the absence of \nadditional financial information, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in \na better position financially than she had been. Applicant\u2019s actions, or inaction, under the \ncircumstances cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n(See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010).) \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, \n2006).)  \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s finances. She is a 63-\nyear-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving as a fraud prevention \nspecialist with her current employer since April 2012. Some of Applicant\u2019s financial \ndifficulties arose when she was attempting to assist her son through his medical and \nfinancial hardships, as well as her three grandchildren, without any apparent awareness \nthat she was causing financial ruin to herself. She explored obtaining assistance to resolve \nher financial difficulties, and she eventually wrote letters to at least some of her creditors. \nShe submitted documentation that she made one $50 payment to a creditor in February \n2019. \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. Because of her failure or refusal to submit documentation associated with her \ndelinquent accounts, such as receipts, cancelled checks, or bank account transactions, \nto support her contentions that any accounts have been settled, paid off, or otherwise \nresolved; that any agreed settlements have actually proceeded to resolution; that any \npayments have actually been made to any creditors; or that the law firm has taken any \naction to resolve any of the accounts, it is difficult to assess the true situation, for we have \nonly her unverified comments claiming that she had taken certain actions. The SOR \nalleges 12 delinquent accounts totaling $40,712, 8 of which were charged off. However, \nin fact, only $9,076 of that total was spent on behalf of her son and granddaughters, and \nthe record is silent as to the reasons why the remaining debts were generated by her. \nThe only confirmed evidence of positive action is on $50 payment to a creditor in February \n2019.  \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nWhile Applicant contended that she took certain actions with respect to her \ndelinquent debts, the only verified action that she has taken is one $50 payment made in \nFebruary 2019. Despite efforts to have her furnish documentation to support her \ncontentions, she has repeatedly ignored such guidance. Her current track record is poor. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from her financial \nconsiderations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.l:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Price, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n09/23/2019 \n______________\nDecision \n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge: \nBased on the record in this case,1 I grant Applicant=s clearance. \nOn 8 February 2019, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent Applicant a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial \nConsiderations.2 Applicant timely answered the SOR, requesting a hearing before the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). DOHA assigned the case to me 7 May \n2019 and I convened a hearing 11 June 2019. DOHA received the transcript 20 June \n2019. \n1Consisting of the transcript (Tr.), Government exhibits (GE) 1-6, hearing exhibit (HE) I, and Applicant \nexhibits (AE) A-I. AE AE H-I were timely received post hearing. The record closed 25 June  2019, when \nDepartment Counsel stated no objection to AE I. \n2DoD acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, effective on \n8 June 2017. \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant denied the SOR financial allegations, except SOR 1.b. and 1.g She \ndenied the remainder of the allegations on the grounds that they had been settled, or \nwere in repayment. Applicant is a 28-year-old diplomatic security officer employed by a \ndefense contractor since September 2017. She has never married and has no children. \nShe claims to have previously had a background investigation by another Government \nagency, but was unable to provide a date. This is her first application for an industrial \nclearance (GE 1). \n \nThe SOR alleges, and GE 2-6 substantiate, six delinquent debts totaling over  \n$10,000. While the SOR alleges that all six accounts were charged off, Applicant=s \nJanuary 2019 report (GE 4)Cupon which the SOR is based, shows that SOR debts 1.a \nand 1.c were closed, but not charged off. All six debts had last activity dates of June or \nJuly 2018. Applicant admitted filing a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in August 2018, a \npetition that was dismissed in November 2018 for abuse. She also admitted SOR debt \n1.b because she had not yet been able to settle the account. The creditor would not agree \nto a settlement amount while the account still appeared on Applicant=s credit report as \nbeing in bankruptcy. \n \nApplicant frankly attributed her financial problems to her irresponsible financial \nbehavior while in college. Like her mother before her, she used credit cards to pay living \nexpenses, and then just made the minimum payments on the accounts. However, her \nSeptember 2017 credit report (GE 3) shows no delinquent debt, including several debts \nthat were later alleged in the SOR. After Applicant obtained her job as a security officer, \nand began to discuss her finances with her sensible older brother, she was feeling \noverwhelmed about her consumer debt and her education loan debt. She consulted a \nbankruptcy attorney who recommended filing for bankruptcy protection without telling her \nthat her income was too high to qualify to discharge her consumer debt. She filed her \nChapter 7 petition in August 2018. She discussed the bankruptcy with a Government \nagent in September 2018 (GE2). The petition was dismissed in November 2018 for \nabuseCthe statutory term for ineligibility. However, even the bankruptcy judge noted that \nshe might have been eligible for bankruptcy under another chapter, perhaps a Chapter \n13 wage earner plan (GE 6). Applicant=s attorney later told her the petition was dismissed \nbecause she lived at home, not on her own. \n \nAfter the new year, Applicant began addressing her delinquent debts. Operating \nfrom a January 2019 dunning letter from the collection agent for SOR debt 1.a, which \ninvited settlement discussions, Applicant negotiated a settlement of 50% of the debt. \nApplicant annotated the letter to show that the payment was due in February 2019. She \nproduced a February letter from the collection agent confirming resolution of the account \n(AE A). Similarly, the collection agent for SOR debt 1.b reached out to Applicant in early \nMarch 2019, she reached an unstated agreement, and received confirmation of payment \nfrom both the collection agent and the creditor in late March 2019 (AE B). So too, the \nSOR 1.c collection agent settled the debt in late February 2019, for 75% of the amount \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \ndue, and documented final payment in March 2019 (AE C). Working from a late November \n2018 credit card statement, Applicant entered into a 12-month repayment plan in \nDecember 2018, which required her to make a large deposit payment in late December \n2018, then lower monthly payments through November 2019 (AE D). Applicant made the \nfirst three payments as required, and paid the last nine installments in a lump sum in \nMarch 2019 (AE H, I), In early February 2019, the collection agent for both the SOR 1.e \nand 1.f creditor (a bank whose principal business is issuing store credit cards) sent \nApplicant two dunning letters. Later that month, Applicant settled each account for about \n45% of the amount due. She received confirmation of payment in mid-April 2019 (AE E, \nF). \n \nApplicant received the financial counseling required to file a bankruptcy petition. \nShe submitted no budget. However, she submitted a detailed report chronicling the \nstatus, not only of the SOR debts, but of several other debts that were never delinquent  \nto the Government=s knowledge, along with documentation of her efforts to deal with the \ncreditors on those debts. She did not present any evidence from coworkers, character \nreferences, or community groups. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person=s suitability for \naccess to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented. \nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG & 2(a). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself, \nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the \nrelevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations). \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant=s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does,  \nthe burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government=s case. \nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden \nof persuasion. \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. \nThe Aclearly consistent with the national interest@ standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant=s suitability for access in favor of the Government.3 \n                                                 \n3See, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, but \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns. Applicant was clearly irresponsible with her \nfinances during her college years, having numerous consumer credit accounts that she \nkept going by just making the minimum payments. When she got her first real job out of \ncollege she began to realize that this course of action was not sustainable. She consulted \nan attorney, who gave her bad advice, and she filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which she \nwas not entitled to do because of her income level. However, by this time the damage \nwas done Having apparently stopped making payments on the SOR accounts during the \nrun up to her petition filing and during the pendency of the petition, the accounts fell \ndelinquent largely as alleged in the SOR.4 However, once her bankruptcy petition was \ndismissed, she began to address the debts in an orderly fashion. It appears that Applicant \nwas engaging the creditors on two debts before the SOR was issued, and dealing with \nthe creditor on two more debts before she received the SOR. By the time Applicant \nanswered the SOR, each of the SOR debts was resolved or heading for resolution, \nalthough some confirmations of final resolution were not received until after she answered \nthe SOR. \n \nHowever, Applicant meets the mitigating factors for financial considerations. Her \nfinancial difficulties are actually few, although recent, but may be considered unlikely to \nrecur.5 Although her financial problems were not due to circumstances beyond her \ncontrol, but once her abortive attempt to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy was closed, she \nbegan reasonable efforts to resolve the debts.6 A similar analysis, including completion \nof the bankruptcy-required financial counseling, supports a conclusion that the debts have \nbeen resolved through settlement,7 and that that resolution was made in good faith.8  \n \nThe Appeal Board has stated that an Applicant need not have paid every debt \nalleged in the SOR, need not pay the SOR debts first, and need not be paying on all debts \nsimultaneously. Applicant need only establish that there is a credible and realistic plan to \n                                                 \n4&&9(a) inability to satisfy debts; (b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; (c) a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations; \n5&20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that \nit is  unlikely to recur . . .  \n6&20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control . . . \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n7&20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications \nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control; \n8&20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nresolve the financial problems, accompanied by significant actions to implement the plan.9 \nApplicant=s efforts to date constitute such a plan, and she has documented significant \naction to resolve her debts. Applicant seems to have learned her lesson about financial \nresponsibility, and appears unlikely to experience financial problems under these \ncircumstances again. Applicant has adequately addressed the security concerns raised \nby her past irresponsibility. I conclude Guideline F for Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nParagraph 1.

Henderson, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n08/21/2019 \nDecision \nCOACHER, Robert E., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline \nH, \ndrug \ninvolvement \nand \nsubstance \nmisuse, \nand \nGuideline \nE, \npersonal \nconduct. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn February 28, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline H, drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, and Guideline E, personal conduct. The DOD acted \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nOn April 1, 2019, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The \ncase was assigned to me on May 1, 2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n\n \n2 \n \n \n(DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on May 28, 2019, and the hearing was held on July \n24, 2019. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1-3, which were admitted into evidence \nwithout objection. The Government\u2019s exhibit list was marked as hearing exhibit (HE) I. \nApplicant testified and offered exhibits (AE) A through D, which were admitted into \nevidence without objection. Applicant\u2019s non-evidentiary submissions were marked as \nHE II-IV. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on August 5, 2019. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer, he admitted all the Guideline H allegations, but denied the \nGuideline E allegations. I adopt his admissions as findings of fact. After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 28 years old. He is engaged to be married and has no children. He \nhas worked for his current employer, a major defense contractor, since July 2016. He \nholds bachelor degrees in computer science and mathematics. He has held a security \nclearance since September 2016. (Tr. at 5-6, 19; GE 1-3) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana, with varying frequency, from \nJanuary 2012 to at least January 2019; that he used marijuana while being granted \naccess to classified information in September 2016; and he stated he intended to use \nmarijuana in the future. The SOR also alleged that Applicant falsified his answers when \ncompleting his security clearance applications (SCA) in May and October 2016 when he \nfailed to disclose his marijuana use within the last seven years on both SCAs, and when \nhe failed to disclose his use of marijuana while having access to classified information \non his October 2016 SCA. \n \n \n \nApplicant described his marijuana use as beginning in approximately 2012 when \na friend baked some marijuana-laced brownies that Applicant consumed. This use was \nin a state that prohibited marijuana use for any purposes. Applicant was diagnosed with \nthroat cancer in 2011 and received radiation treatment for over six months. The \ntreatment left Applicant with regular migraine headaches. Applicant claims his primary \ncare doctor (unnamed) recommended that he use marijuana for the pain. The doctor did \nnot provide a written recommendation or prescription for marijuana use. (Tr. at 20-22; \nAnswer; AE A, D) \n \n \nIn 2016, after getting the job with his employer, Applicant moved to a state where \nmarijuana has been legalized under state law. He then began using marijuana more \nfrequently. His frequency of use after he began working for his employer and completing \nhis first SCA was one to two times a month. He claimed he used marijuana only to deal \nwith the migraine pain at night so he could sleep. He purchased marijuana from \ndispensaries. He used marijuana after completing his SCA in May 2016, after receiving \na security clearance in September 2016, after completing his SCA in October 2016, \nafter completing his background interview (BI) with a defense investigator in March \n2018, and after answering interrogatories in February 2019. Applicant did not stop using \n\n \n3 \n \n \nmarijuana until after he received the SOR in March 2019. In both his BI in March 2018 \nand in his answers to interrogatories in February 2019, he stated that he intended to \ncontinue using marijuana in the future. (Tr. at 20-22, 24-27, 29; Answer; GE 1-3; AE A, \nD)    \n \n \nApplicant claims he was unaware that marijuana use was prohibited under \nfederal law until he saw a \u201cflyer\u201d posted at work about the subject. He took a pre-\nemployment drug test, but does not recall being informed about the company\u2019s drug \npolicies. (Note: the Drug-Free Workplace Act requires Federal contractors with a \ncontract over $100,000 to establish certain drug-free workplace policies. (See, 41 U.S. \nCode \u00a7 8101-8106. See also, the Federal Acquisition Regulation, 48 C.F.R \u00a7 52.223-6, \nDrug-Free Workplace)) He admitted that he failed to seek out more information after \nnoticing the flyer and continued to use marijuana. Once he received the SOR, he \nrealized that his marijuana use was a significant issue and in his SOR answer he \nclaimed he would cease using marijuana immediately and try to find another type of \npain relief for his migraines. He provided drug test results from June 2019 showing a \nnegative presence for marijuana (THC) or any other illegal drugs. He also volunteered \nto take drug tests in the future to show his commitment to abstinence. (Tr. at 21, 24-25, \n31-32; Answer; AE A) \n \n \nApplicant explained the reason he failed to list his drug use on his May 2016 \nSCA was because he was out of the country at the time his employer notified him that \nhe needed to complete the SCA immediately. He only had his cell phone and the SCA \nformat was not displaying well on his phone. As a result, he incorrectly answered no to \nthe question about past drug use within seven years. He claimed this was a mistake \nand not intentional. He received his secret clearance in September 2016 and in October \n2016 was told to complete another SCA to request a top secret clearance. He again \nfailed to list his marijuana use within the last seven years and he also failed to list his \nuse while possessing a security clearance. Applicant explained his incorrect answers by \nstating that since this SCA was prepopulated with the information he provided on his \nMay 2016 SCA, he did not scrutinize his answers as closely as he should have to make \nany changes. He did update one area of this October 2016 SCA to show that he now \npossessed a secret clearance. When Applicant was asked during his BI whether his \nanswers to the drug questions were correct, he stated no and described his previous \ndrug use. (Tr. at 22-23, 27, 31; Answer; GE 1-3) \n \n \nApplicant presented an email from his employer indicating that he was selected \nas the employee of the month for April 2019. This award was given to him for \ndemonstrating outstanding analytical and problem solving skills. (AE B) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n\n \n4 \n \n \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive section E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive section E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \n \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement:  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \n \nIn addition to the above matters, I note that the Director of National Intelligence \n(DNI) issued an October 25, 2014 memorandum concerning adherence to federal laws \nprohibiting marijuana use. In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state \ncan authorize violations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances \nAct, which identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Second, changes to \nstate law (and the laws of the District of Columbia) concerning marijuana use do not \nalter the national security adjudicative guidelines. And third, a person\u2019s disregard of \nfederal law concerning the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains relevant \nwhen making eligibility decisions for sensitive national security positions. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Those that are potentially applicable in this case include: \n \n(a) any substance misuse;  \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and   \n \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana on one occasion in 2012, then on a one to two times a \nmonth basis from May 2016 through March 2019. He used marijuana after being \ngranted a secret clearance in September 2016. During his March 2018 BI and in his \nanswers to interrogatories in February 2019, he stated his intent was to continue using \nmarijuana. I find all the above disqualifying conditions apply.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two \npotentially apply in this case: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use was frequent and as recent as February 2019, while \nholding a security clearance and after he answered interrogatory questions about his \ndrug use. Given his recent pattern of use, his claimed abstinence, beginning in March \n2019, is not sufficient to overcome his recent drug use. He did not provide a signed \nstatement of intent to abstain from all future illegal drug use. Additionally, as recently as \nFebruary 2019, he indicated his intent was to continue his use of marijuana. Applicant\u2019s \nclaimed abstention and one negative drug test are insufficient to convince me that \nrecurrence is unlikely. The frequency and recency of his past use and his recent \nstatement of intent to continue his use casts doubt upon his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and AG 26(b) do not apply.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s explanation for failing to list his drug use on his May 2016 SCA is \ncredible. His circumstances of being out of the country and trying to use his cell phone \nto complete the SCA led to a mistake and not an intentional withholding of material \ninformation about his past drug use. However, no credible explanation was presented \nregarding his failure to explain his past drug use and use while holding a security \nclearance on his October 2016 SCA. He had sufficient time to review his prepopulated \nanswers from his earlier SCA and make any necessary changes, which he did to update \nthe status of his security clearance. He failed to make any updates concerning his drug \nuse. Additionally, given his employers obligation under the Drug-Free Workplace Act, I \nfind Applicant\u2019s claim that he was unaware of the company\u2019s drug policy not credible. \nAG \u00b6 16(a) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2(b) and 2(c). \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 17 and found the following relevant: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \nApplicant disclosed his false statements when asked during his BI if his drug use \ninformation on his two SCAs was correct. However, a prompt good-faith effort to correct \nhis false drug use information should have been made when he completed his October \n2016 SCA, not a year and a half later when his BI was conducted. Providing false \ninformation on a SCA is not a minor offense because it is important to the overall \nsecurity review process. Applicant\u2019s non-disclosure of his drug history on his October \n2016 SCA casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Neither of \nthe above mitigating conditions fully apply.   \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n8 \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.   \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s medical \nissues, his work performance award, his recent negative drug-test results, and his most \nrecent statement of intention of no future marijuana use. However, I also considered \nthat he used marijuana on numerous occasions while holding a security clearance and \nthat as recently as February 2019, he expressed his intent to continue using marijuana. \nIt was only after he received the SOR and realized that using marijuana jeopardized his \nsecurity clearance that he had a change of heart concerning his future intentions. He \nintentionally failed to disclose his marijuana drug use on his October 2016 SCA.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline H, \ndrug involvement and Guideline E, personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs     1.a - 1.c: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph       2.a: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs     2.b - 2.c: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 49 years old. He is a native-born U.S. citizen. His father was a major in the U.S. Army. He is the owner and chief executive officer (CEO) of his own business. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree from a U.S. university. He has never held a security clearance. He married for the second time in 2016. He was married to his first wife from 1998 to 2009.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 14, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guidelines B and H. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines implemented on June 8, 2017 (AG). \n \nApplicant answered (Ans.) the SOR on July 25, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. On September 3, 2019, the case was assigned to me. \n\n \n2 \n \n \nOn September 10, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified \nApplicant that the hearing was scheduled for September 26, 2019. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. Government exhibits (GE) 1 through 3 were admitted in evidence \nwithout objection. The Government\u2019s exhibit list and request for administrative notice \nwere marked as hearing exhibits (HE) I and II. Applicant testified, but did not offer \nexhibits at the hearing. The record was held open until October 25, 2019, and Applicant \ntimely submitted exhibits (AE) A and B, which were admitted without objection. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on October 7, 2019. \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nI took administrative notice of facts concerning India. Department Counsel \nprovided supporting documents that verify, detail, and provide context for the requested \nfacts. The specific facts noticed are included in the Findings of Fact. \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. Usually administrative notice in ISCR proceedings is \naccorded to facts that are either well known or from U.S. Government reports. (See \nISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, \n2004) and McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d \nCir. 1986); Stein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen \ntypes of facts for administrative notice)) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he denied the Guideline E allegation and \nadmitted the Guideline H allegations with explanations. His admissions are incorporated \ninto the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the evidence, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 49 years old. He is a native-born U.S. citizen. His father was a major \nin the U.S. Army. He is the owner and chief executive officer (CEO) of his own \nbusiness. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree from a U.S. university. He has never held a \nsecurity clearance. He married for the second time in 2016. He was married to his first \nwife from 1998 to 2009. He has three children, ages 19, 17, and 16. His ex-wife, wife, \nand children are U.S. citizens and residents. (Tr. 6, 39; GE 1) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s ownership and control over an information \nsystems (IT) company located in India create a conflict of interest under Guideline B. \nThe SOR further alleged under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana with varying \nfrequency from October 1988 to February 2017, and that Applicant stated, in August \n2018, his intent to continue using marijuana in the future. \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nForeign Influence \n \n \nIn 2009, Applicant became the sole owner of his U.S.-based IT company (C1), \nwhich has customers throughout the world. C1 was built to implement out-of-the-box \npackaged software, such as Oracle, to help companies improve the way they do \nbusiness. Applicant, through C1, also owns an IT company established and located in \nIndia (C2). Applicant describes C2 as merely a \u201ctool\u201d for his overall business to use to \nreduce costs. Many large multinational companies such as Accenture, Deloitte, and IBM \nuse the same business structure. C2 performs technical information tasks that their \nglobal clients require. C2 is a virtual company which has no servers of its own and \ntherefore does not store any customer data itself. The Indian government has no \nregulatory control over C2. Applicant estimated the 2018 revenues for C1 at $18 million \nand for C2 at $1.9 million. Applicant has never been to India. Applicant credibly stated \nthat if C1 were to win a U.S. government contract with security implications, C2 would \nbe excluded from any participation in the administration of that contract. C1 currently \nhas such contracts with other U.S. government agencies and C2 is excluded from \nparticipation in those contracts. (Tr. 22, 24-32, 34-36; Ans.; GE 2-3) \n \nIndia \n \n \nIndia is a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic. It is a multiparty, \nfederal parliamentary democracy with a bicameral parliament and a population of \napproximately 1.1 billion. \n \n \nThe Indian government generally respects the rights of its citizens, but serious \nproblems remain. Police and security forces have engaged in extrajudicial killings of \npersons in custody, disappearance, torture, and rape. The lack of accountability \npermeated the government and security forces, creating an atmosphere in which human \nrights violations went unpunished. A number of violent attacks were committed in recent \nyears by separatist and terrorist groups. In November 2008, terrorists coordinated an \nattack at a hotel in Mumbai, frequented by westerners. \n \nThe United States recognizes India as key to strategic interests and has \nsought to strengthen its relationship with it. The two countries are the world\u2019s \nlargest democracies, both are committed to political freedom protected by \nrepresentative government, and share common interests in the free flow of \ncommerce, in fighting terrorism, and in creating a strategically stable Asia. However, \ndifferences over India\u2019s nuclear weapons program and pace of economic reform \nexist. There are also concerns about India\u2019s relations with Iran, including their \nincreasing cooperation with the Iranian military. \n \nThere have been cases involving the illegal export or attempted illegal export of \nU.S. restricted, dual-use technology to India, including technology and equipment which \nwere determined to present an unacceptable risk of diversion to programs for the \ndevelopment of weapons of mass destruction or their means of delivery. Foreign \ngovernment and private entities, including intelligence organizations and security \n\n \n4 \n \n \nservices, have capitalized on private-sector acquisitions of U.S. technology. In March \n2008, an American businessman pleaded guilty to conspiring to illegally exporting \ntechnology to entities in India. \n \n \nThe United States views India as a growing world power with which it shares \ncommon strategic interests. There is a strong partnership between the two countries \nand they are expected to continue addressing differences and shaping a dynamic and \ncollaborative future. The United States and India seek to elevate the strategic \npartnership further to include counterterrorism, defense, education, and joint \ndemocracy promotion. (HE II) \n \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nApplicant admitted to using marijuana approximately 100 times in the past 30 \nyears. He testified that his latest use of marijuana was in July or August of 2019. Before \nthat it was in February 2019. He described his use as limited social use, two to three \ntimes a year, such as when he went to a concert. Applicant lives in a state where \nmarijuana is legal under state law. He purchased marijuana from legal dispensaries in \nhis state and has done so two to three times. He was specifically asked if he would use \nmarijuana in the future and he replied \u201cyes.\u201d (Tr. 32-33, 37; Ans.; GE 2) \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \n \nApplicant testified about his community involvement with local youth \norganizations, including his significant fund-raising efforts for disadvantaged children. \nHis testimony was bolstered in that regard by a letter from the organization\u2019s CEO, who \nfurther described Applicant\u2019s philanthropic efforts. (AE A-B) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d as \nfollows:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and  \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could \nsubject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation or personal conflict of interest. \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an Applicant\u2019s \nbusiness relationship in India may create vulnerabilities to government coercion or \ninducement. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the \nforeign country has an authoritarian government, a family member or friend is \nassociated with or dependent upon the government, the country is known to conduct \nintelligence collection operations against the United States, or the foreign country is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism. The relationship between India and the United States \nplaces a significant, but not insurmountable burden of persuasion on Applicant to \ndemonstrate that his business relationship with C2 in India does not pose a security \nrisk. Applicant should not be placed in a position where he might be forced to choose \nbetween loyalty to the United States and a desire to assist C2 in India which might be \ncoerced by governmental entities, or pressured to assist India.  \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004)) \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States \nover matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, \nwe know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. \n \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives from India seek or have \nsought classified or economic information from or through Applicant or C2 in India, it is \n\n \n7 \n \n \nnot possible to rule out such a possibility in the future. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(f) apply \nbased upon Applicant\u2019s relationship with C2 and its business interests in India.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns, \nincluding:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and    \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nApplicant credibly testified about the nature of his business relationship with C2 \nin India. He presented sufficient evidence to establish that it is unlikely that he would be \nplaced in a position to choose between the interest of C2 in India and those of the \nUnited States. AG \u00b6 8(a) applies. \n \nApplicant has met his burden to establish his \u201cdeep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d He is a native-born U.S. citizen whose father was \nan officer in the U.S. Army. He graduated from a U.S. university and went on to start a \nhighly successful U.S.-based IT company, C1. He works and lives in the United States \nwith his wife and three children. He has never been to India. The evidence supports that \nApplicant has longstanding ties to the United States and would resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(b) applies.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial interests in this country, namely C1, which had revenues of \n$18 million in 2018 are much more substantial than his interests in India, where C2\u2019s \n2018 revenues amounted to only $1.9 million. AG \u00b6 8(f) applies. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \n \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \n \nIn addition to the above matters, I note that the Director of National Intelligence \n(DNI) issued an October 25, 2014 memorandum concerning adherence to federal laws \nprohibiting marijuana use. In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state \ncan authorize violations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances \nAct, which identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Second, changes to \nstate law (and the laws of the District of Columbia) concerning marijuana use do not \nalter the national security adjudicative guidelines. And third, a person\u2019s disregard of \nfederal law concerning the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains relevant \nwhen making eligibility decisions for sensitive national security positions. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Those that are potentially applicable in this case include: \n \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana on numerous occasions over the past 30 years. He \nused marijuana as recently as July or August of 2019. He has no intention of stopping \nhis occasional social use of marijuana. Specifically, he testified that he would use \nmarijuana in the future. I find both of the above disqualifying conditions apply.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two \npotentially apply in this case: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \n \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \n \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \n \neligibility.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use was frequent and as recent as July or August of 2019. \nHe intends to continue his marijuana use in the future. The recency of his past use and \nhis recent statement of intent to continue his use casts doubt upon his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and AG 26(b) do not apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The circumstances tending to \nsupport denying Applicant\u2019s clearance are more significant than the factors weighing \ntowards granting his clearance. Applicant mitigated the foreign influence concerns. I \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s business success and his community involvement. I also \nappreciated the candor with which Applicant described his marijuana use. However, I \n\n \n10 \n \n \nalso considered that he used marijuana on numerous occasions over the past 30 years, \nincluding as recently as July or August 2019, and his expressed intent to continue using \nmarijuana in the future. \n \nOverall the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude that the security concerns arising under Guideline B, foreign influence, were \nmitigated, but that the concerns under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, were not mitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph       1.a: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs     2.a \u2013 2b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nRobert E.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 59-year-old married employee of a defense contractor. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree, and a master\u2019s degree. He is employed as a security manager, and is seeking to retain a security clearance previously granted in connection with his employment. He has worked for his current employer since 2016. He has worked in the security field, either as a contractor employee or a Federal civil servant, since 1985. For most of that time he held a security clearance. (Tr. 55; Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, and 17; Exhibit 4 at Section 13B.) Paragraph 1 (Guideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct) The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged in conduct that shows poor judgment, untrustworthiness or unreliability. Applicant denied both allegations under this paragraph. The allegations will be addressed in chronological order for ease of discussion. Applicant worked for a defense contractor [Company A] from 2004 until 2016. During that time he was a security manager. 1.b. The SOR alleged in this subparagraph that Applicant was suspended from employment for three days in about April 2010 for inappropriate comments concerning ethics and diversity in the workplace.

(Government Exhibit 1.) On March 8, 2019, the \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline E \n(Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, effective within the Department of Defense on June \n8, 2017. \n  \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on April 4, 2019, and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed \non April 30, 2019. The case was assigned to me on May 21, 2019. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on June 10, 2019. I convened \nthe hearing as scheduled on August 2, 2019. The Government offered Government \nExhibits 1 through 6, which were admitted without objection. Applicant offered Applicant \nExhibits A through D, which were admitted without objection, and testified on his own \nbehalf. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to leave the record open to permit him to submit \nadditional evidence. On August 2, 2019, he submitted Applicant Exhibits E and F, which \nwere admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nAugust 14, 2019. \n  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 59-year-old married employee of a defense contractor. He has a \nbachelor\u2019s degree, and a master\u2019s degree. He is employed as a security manager, and is \nseeking to retain a security clearance previously granted in connection with his \nemployment. He has worked for his current employer since 2016. He has worked in the \nsecurity field, either as a contractor employee or a Federal civil servant, since 1985. For \nmost of that time he held a security clearance. (Tr. 55; Government Exhibit 1 at Sections \n12, 13A, and 17; Exhibit 4 at Section 13B.) \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct) \n \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has engaged in conduct that shows poor judgment, untrustworthiness or \nunreliability. Applicant denied both allegations under this paragraph. The allegations will \nbe addressed in chronological order for ease of discussion. \n \nApplicant worked for a defense contractor [Company A] from 2004 until 2016. \nDuring that time he was a security manager. \n \n1.b. The SOR alleged in this subparagraph that Applicant was suspended from \nemployment for three days in about April 2010 for inappropriate comments concerning \nethics and diversity in the workplace. Applicant denied this allegation. \n \nThe records of this incident are rather sparse, but it appears that Company A\u2019s \nHuman Resources department [HR] was concerned about a comment made by Applicant, \nwho is white, concerning diversity in the workplace. Applicant has consistently stated that \nhe merely repeated back to the original speaker, a minority woman, the comment she \nhad made to him in a joking manner, \u201cYou had to be black to work in this [Applicant\u2019s] \ndepartment.\u201d (Tr. 32-37, 72-75; Answer; Government Exhibit 5, and Exhibit 6 at 8.) \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s version of this event was supported by another minority woman, who \nwas present at the time of the incident. Applicant Exhibit A at 11 is a letter from this \nperson, confirming Applicant\u2019s account. She further stated that the original comment was \nin jest, and also stated that neither the writer nor the original speaker were offended by \nApplicant repeating the phrase.  \n \nAlthough Applicant has repeatedly and consistently proclaimed his innocence, he \nagreed to accept a three-day suspension without pay. He took these days off during \npreviously scheduled vacation, so technically it did not result in a suspension from the \nwork place. Applicant\u2019s first and second-line supervisors at that time submitted letters that \nconfirm it was on their recommendation Applicant agreed to the suspension. Both writers \nalso stated that they believed the Applicant to be innocent of any racial intent in his \nstatement. (Tr. 75-78; Applicant Exhibit A at 5-8.) \n \n1.a. The SOR alleged in this subparagraph that Applicant was terminated from his \nemployment with Company A in October 2016 for engaging in a pattern of harassing and \ninappropriate behavior of a sexual nature in the workplace. Applicant denied this \nallegation. \n \nApplicant was the subject of an investigation by Company A in the early fall of \n2016. This investigation was based on the complaints of a Confidential Reporting Party \n(CRP). The CRP stated that Applicant had engaged in four incidents of sexual \nharassment during 2015 and 2016. The CRP was a witness to the incidents, but the \nApplicant\u2019s conduct was not aimed at the CRP. In a nutshell, Applicant was alleged to \nhave used suggestive language when speaking to work colleagues. He also \ncomplimented a female coworker on her attire, and made a comment about the legs of \nanother female coworker. Finally, he was alleged to have leered at another female \nemployee and made a suggestive noise. (Government Exhibit 6.) \n \nApplicant admitted complimenting a coworker on her attire, and calling another \ncoworker, \u201cLegs,\u201d once in a joking manner. He denied the other two allegations, stating \nhe could not remember the conduct, or that his conduct was misinterpreted. He did admit \nthat the \u201cLegs\u201d comment was probably out of place. He indicated that the occasion when \nhe was accused of making suggestive noises was due to side effects of heart medication. \n(Answer; Government Exhibit 2; Applicant Exhibit A at 3-4, Exhibit D; Tr. 38-53, 81-83, \n87-89.) \n \nAfter the completion of the investigator\u2019s report on September 16, 2016, several \nthings were happening almost simultaneously. While Company A was deciding what to \ndo with Applicant, he had received a job offer from Company B, which he submitted as \nan exhibit. This offer, dated September 22, 2016, had a proposed start date for Applicant \nof October 17, 2016, a Monday. Applicant submitted his resignation from Company A on \nFriday, September 30, 2016. In his resignation, Applicant proposed a final day of his \nworking for Company A of Friday, October 14, 2019. On Tuesday, October 4, 2016, \nApplicant was called into a meeting with an HR representative and his manager. At that \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nmeeting Applicant was told that Company A was accepting his resignation in lieu of \nterminating him. Applicant stated that he was resigning anyway, they could characterize \nit however they wanted, but he felt he was not resigning in lieu of being terminated. \n(Government Exhibit 2; Applicant Exhibit A at 3-4, Exhibit F; Tr. 37, 91-96, 105-107.) \n \nApplicant expressed issues with the credibility of the CRP, stating this person was \nvindictive towards Applicant. He also expressed concerns with how the investigation was \nconducted and the subsequent report written. Applicant stated there were inaccuracies in \nthe report. (Answer; Applicant Exhibit A at 3-4; Tr. 40-41, 45-47, 50, 55-59, 84-86, 102, \n108.) \n \nApplicant admitted that he had changed how he did his job based on this \ninvestigation, and its aftermath. He stated, \u201cI have to be very conservative, very \nbusinesslike, very cautious as far as who I say what to who and who\u2019s in earshot.\u201d (Tr. \n100-103.)  \n \nMitigation \n \n \nApplicant submitted evidence showing that he is a highly respected and successful \nperson and employee. He has a demanding job, and does it well. Letters of \nrecommendation were submitted for Applicant from people who know him personally and \nprofessionally. The writers include three of his former supervisors, as well as coworkers, \na retired judge, and an FBI agent. He is described by all of the writers as an ethical, \nhonorable, and moral person. They all indicated an understanding of the allegations \nagainst Applicant, and considered them out of character. (Applicant Exhibit A; Tr. 21-23.) \n \n \nApplicant is heavily involved in charity work in his community. In addition, he has \nbeen involved in several organizations that are related to his career field. (Applicant \nExhibit A at 2, 13; Tr. 53-55.)    \n \n \nPolicies \n \nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. When evaluating an \napplicant=s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each \nguideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions (DCs) and \nmitigating conditions (MCs), which are to be used in evaluating an applicant=s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG & 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge=s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG && 2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nguidelines in the context of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. In addition, \nthe administrative judge may also rely on his or her own common sense, as well as \nknowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG & 2(b) \nrequires that, AAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.@ In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive & E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive & E3.1.15, AThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.@ Section 7 \nof Executive Order 10865 provides: AAny determination under this order adverse to an \napplicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.@ \n \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \n \nAnalysis \n \n \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct) \nThe security concern relating to Personal Conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules or regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or \nprovide truthful and candid answers during national security investigative or \nadjudicative processes. \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \n \nI have examined the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16 and especially \nconsidered the following: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior;  \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and   \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 apply to the facts of this case: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \n \nTurning first to the 2010 incident, which resulted in a three-day suspension from \nwork without pay. The evidence indicates that this was not a case of racial insensitivity \non the part of Applicant. Rather, as confirmed by one of the people involved in the \nincident, herself a woman of color, Applicant was merely repeating back to the speaker a \ncomment that was made to him. While the conduct itself was substantiated, it does not \nhave any continuing security significance. It is also mitigating that this conduct occurred \nnine years ago. \n \n \nWith regard to the 2016 situation, the Applicant did engage in at least two incidents \nthat could have been seen as harassing. Specifically the \u201cLegs\u201d incident and the \ncompliment. The other two incidents were very minor, and the evidence very sparse. The \nCRP asserted all of them to be harassing. Applicant indicated that this person had a \npotential vendetta against Applicant, and that is why he was reported. These four \nallegations, while fairly innocuous individually, were interpreted by Company A \nmanagement as showing Applicant not being sensitive enough to how the work \nenvironment had changed. Based on the report, Company A made a decision to terminate \nApplicant. Applicant\u2019s decision to resign about the same time and accept another job may \nhave given Company A\u2019s HR department a convenient out, when they accepted it early. \n \n \nApplicant has changed his work habits. As stated, the conduct was minor and did \nnot involve any overt sexual harassment. Applicant has not engaged in any conduct of a \nsimilar nature in his three years at his new employment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a), (b), and (c) apply \nto Applicant\u2019s conduct under both subparagraphs. Paragraph 1 is found for Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant=s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a law abiding, \ntrustworthy, and responsible person and employee. He acknowledged that his conduct, \nwhich he believed to be innocent and innocuous, could be misinterpreted. Applicant has \nchanged how he conducts himself. Any potential for pressure, coercion, or duress has \nbeen eliminated, and such conduct is unlikely to recur. Overall, the record evidence does \nnot create doubt as to Applicant=s present suitability for national security eligibility. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by & E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant=s national security \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n                                                \n \n \n \n \nWILFORD H. ROSS \nAdministrative Judge \n",
