Applicant has not mitigated the \nGovernment's security concerns under Guideline I and Guideline G. Eligibility for access \nto classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on January 23, 2020. The \nDepartment of Defense (DoD) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated November \n23, 2022, alleging security concerns under Guideline I and Guideline G. The DoD acted \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \nApplicant answered the SOR and requested a decision on the written record \nwithout a hearing.

His \nadmissions in his Answer are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is 46 years old. He is married to his third spouse and has two children \nand three adult stepchildren. He has worked for his sponsor since 2007 as an inspector. \nHe earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2007. He has never held a security clearance. (Item \n3 at 7, 12, 16-18, 20-23, and 36.) \nGuideline I \u2013 Psychological Conditions \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: On July 29, 2022, at the request of the DoD, Applicant underwent a \npsychological evaluation. The DoD psychologist concurred with the diagnosis of his \ntreating physicians that he had major depressive disorder, recurrent, mild, and an alcohol \nuse disorder. (Item 4 at 6.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: Applicant\u2019s history of suicidality goes back to 1993, when he \nintentionally overdosed on Tylenol with codeine. (Item 4 at 7.) SOR \u00b6 1.c:\n \n His most recent \nsuicide attempt occurred in the summer of 2018, after a domestic disturbance, when he \nintentionally overdosed on a prescription muscle relaxer, Baclofen. (Item 3 at 35 and Item \n5 at 26.) As a result of the overdose, he was placed in a medically induced coma. SOR \u00b6 \n1.b: After the 2018 suicide attempt, he underwent psychiatric treatment and was \ndiagnosed with major depression, recurrent, severe, without psychosis, and alcohol use \ndisorder, severe. (Item 5 at 4-5.) SOR \u00b6 1.f: During treatment after his 2018 suicide \nattempt, he reported five suicide attempts since the age of 16. (Item 5 at 5.) He \nacknowledged to the DoD psychologist to planning and attempting suicide three times \nsince age 16. (Item 4 at 4.) SOR \u00b6 1.d: In a domestic disturbance in 2005 he placed a \nrevolver to his head before ultimately discharging the weapon into the ceiling. (Item 4 at \n4.) \nApplicant first sought treatment for depression in the early 2000s, after his first \ndivorce.

The medication has been \neffective in moderating his depression, and he continues taking it. Zoloft is his primary \nmeans for treating his mental health issues. (Item 4 at 2 and Item 5 at 5.) However, the \nDoD psychologist noted continued alcohol consumption negates the effectiveness of the \nmedications for his depression. (Item 4 at 6.) Applicant reports his use of medication at \napproximately \u201cone time a week\u201d and described its use to address stress management, \nprocrastination, and to change his attitude. (Item 4 at 2-3.) \nGuideline G \u2013 Alcohol Consumption \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.c: Applicant, even after the events alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and \n1.d, admits in his Answer, and contrary to medical advice, his continued alcohol use. (Item \n4 at 4.) He notes in his Answer his doctor is aware of his continued alcohol use. In his \n2020 security clearance interview he told the investigator as of July 2018 he no longer \nused alcohol. (Item 7 at 8.) During his July 2022 psychological evaluation, he told the \nDoD psychologist he consumed \u201calcohol approximately four times weekly, drinking \nbetween two and five alcoholic beverages each setting, and only drinking more than six \nalcoholic drinks approximately monthly.\u201d (Item 4 at 7.) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d-2.f allege alcohol-related arrests. Applicant admits to each incident: \nthe 2015 incident resulted in him being charged with fourth-degree assault; the 2009 \nincident resulted in an arrest for fourth-degree assault and second-degree disorderly \nconduct; and the 2004 DUI arrest. (Item 3 at 29-32, Item 6, and Item 7 at 4-5.) \nSOR \u00b6 2.b states Applicant has experienced adverse personal, professional, and \nfinancial consequences because of alcohol consumption since at least 2003. In addition \nto the three alcohol-related arrests discussed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d-2.f, the record shows several \nother professional and personal consequences. He attributes alcohol consumption to \nmissing work due to being hungover; his two suicide attempts in 2005 and 2018; his \nsecond divorce; and his financial problems, including a 2014 foreclosure. (Item 4 at 3; \nItem 2 at 2 and Item 5 at 4, 5; Item 3 at 18; and Item 3 at 36-37 Item 4 at 3.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 28. Given Applicant\u2019s diagnoses and suicidal actions the following disqualifying \nconditions are applicable in this case: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors; and \n(b): an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29 are applicable: \n(a): the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b): the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; and \n(e): there is no indication of a current problem. \nAG \u00b6 29(a) is not established.

Insufficient time has passed to demonstrate he has \nmade satisfactory progress in a treatment program. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n         \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines I and G in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).

In \nMarch 2023, the DOE granted his application for the ICR Plan. Pursuant to the ICR \nPlan, he has been required to pay at least $405.01 per month since April 2023. Since \nMarch 2023, he has paid at least that monthly amount and has paid off one of the seven \nstudent loans listed in the SOR. His plan is to pay his student loan accounts pursuant to \nthe ICR Plan until they are paid in full. He claimed that he will pay these loans off in two \nto three years, which is far earlier than the timeline envisioned by the DOE. After March \n2023, the accounts remained in good standing through the end of the Deferment, and \nthere is no evidence that they are delinquent. The Government\u2019s and Applicant\u2019s 2023 \ncredit reports reflect that the student loans are in good standing.

(Tr. 21-24, 27-\n28, 35-36, 42-51, 54-60; Answer; GE 3; AE C, D, H, I) \nDuring the Deferment, Applicant decided to take advantage of the suspension of \npayments and interest to pay off an auto loan with an interest rate higher than that of his \nstudent loans. As of April 2023, he had paid approximately $38,000 to pay off this auto \nloan. He acknowledged that he knew his mother had not been paying his student loans \nin about May 2022 when a DoD investigator referenced them being delinquent. Despite \nthis realization, he continued to concentrate on paying the auto loan because of its \nhigher interest rate and because of the Deferment.

He has earned a number of merit-based awards and bonuses at work. \nIn December 2021, while working full time, he began attending a graduate program at a \nnearby university, where he has a 3.1 grade point average.

He has volunteered with an \norganization that encourages and mentors young students interested in science, \ntechnology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). He testified that he had about \n$17,000 combined in his checking and savings account. He has been contributing about \n15 percent of his salary to a retirement account that had a balance of about $118,000, \nbut plans on reducing that amount to about 12 percent to have more money to pay \ndown his student loans. He currently has no delinquent financial accounts. (Tr 23-27, \n37-41, 52-54, 57, 61; AE A, C, E, F, G) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective within DOD on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s seven student loans, totaling approximately $37,000, became \ndelinquent in 2019. The loans were delinquent at the onset of the Deferment. The \nDeferment does not excuse previously delinquent student loans. See ISCR Case No. \n20-01527 at 2 (App. Bd. June 7, 2021). The above disqualifying conditions are raised. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nA meaningful track record of debt reform includes evidence that debts have been \npaid off or resolved. An applicant is not required to show that every debt in the SOR has \nbeen paid, and there is no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all \noutstanding debts simultaneously. ISCR Case No. 14-00504 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, \n2014). Rather, an applicant is required to demonstrate that he or she has \u201cestablished a \nplan to resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement \nthat plan.\u201d There is also no requirement that the first debts paid in furtherance of a \nreasonable debt plan are the SOR debts. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2 (App. Bd. May \n21, 2008). Guideline F mitigation does not require the payment of all the SOR debts. \nInstead, it requires that Applicant remove trustworthiness and reliability concerns raised \nby those debts. ISCR Case No. 14-00504 at 3. \nDuring the Deferment, Applicant contacted the DOE to set up a repayment plan \nand has made payments pursuant to that plan. He credibly testified that he would \ncontinue to make the required payments and provided evidence that he has the income \nand funds to make his payments. He also planned to reduce the percentage of his \nincome which he contributes to his retirement account so that he has more income to \ndevote to his student loans. His student loan accounts are in good standing. He credibly \ntestified that he understands that he made a mistake regarding his student loans and \nthat he will not do so again. He paid approximately $38,000 to satisfy another account \nwith a higher interest rate. He acted in good faith to resolve the student loan accounts \nand bring them current. He has no financial delinquencies. Both the above-referenced \nmitigating conditions apply. The financial considerations security concern is mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered his good work \nperformance, his continuing effort to better himself through education, and his volunteer \nactivities. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

She neither admitted nor denied SOR \u00b6 2.b, and I am construing her silence \nas a denial of that allegation. She is 56 years old, married, and she has an adult \nstepchild. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1988. She was unemployed from June \n2014 to July 2015 and August 2018 to May 2021. She found short-term employment \nfrom May 2021 to November 2021, but then she was unemployed for a third time from \nNovember 2021 to August 2022.

In addition, she was \ndiagnosed with a chronic medical condition in 2017, which led to her periods of \nunemployment and underemployment, as discussed above. (Items 1-4; FORM \nResponse) \nApplicant stated in her June 2022 Questionnaire for National Security Positions \n(SF 86) and in her Answer that she met with an Internal Revenue Service agent to \nresolve her outstanding tax issues. Having brought their mortgage current in February \n2023, she was working to address her family\u2019s other financial obligations.

(Items 1-4; FORM Response) \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor favorably rated her performance in November 2022. He \nattested to her reliability and noted that she was an outstanding employee. In addition, \nApplicant\u2019s program manager attested to Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and \njudgment. (Item 2; FORM Response) \nPolicies \nThe Under Secretary of Defense\u2019s Memorandum of November 19, 2004, treats \nADP positions as sensitive positions, and it entitles applicants for ADP positions to the \nprocedural protections in the Directive before any final unfavorable access \ndetermination may be made. The standard set out in the adjudicative guidelines for \nassignment to sensitive duties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness \nare such that assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security. AG \u00b6 2.b. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may \ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d The Government must present \nsubstantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nE3.1.14. Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue \neligibility for access to sensitive information.   \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be\ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other\nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental\nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to\nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nApplicant has a history of being unable to pay her debts. She also failed to file \nher federal and state income tax returns, and pay her taxes, for TY 2015 through 2018, \nas required. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) as \ndisqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations trustworthiness \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay  \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to her financial problems. \nThus, the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), she \nmust provide evidence that she acted responsibly under the circumstances. Although \nshe stated that she has met with an IRS agent to resolve her outstanding tax issues, \nshe has not demonstrated that she filed her relevant federal and state income tax \nreturns or made any arrangements with the IRS or the state tax authority to pay her \noutstanding taxes. She has not yet made efforts to address her delinquent student \nloans, and there is no evidence in the record about whether her payments are paused \nunder the COVID-19 relief for federal student loans. There is also no evidence in the \nrecord that she received financial counseling. I find that Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties \ncontinue to cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(g) do not apply. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse as: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \u201c(a) any substance misuse . . .\u201d; \u201c(c) \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nillegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia\u201d; and \n\u201c(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, or failure to \nclearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse.\u201d \nApplicant used and purchased THC with varying frequency from 2018 to 2022. \nAlthough she stated in her FORM response that she expected to wean herself off THC, \nshe had yet to find a medication effective at controlling her symptoms for her to no \nlonger use THC. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(g) apply. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides the following potentially relevant mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: . . . \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug\ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future\ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security\neligibility. \n \n \n \nApplicant has not established a pattern of abstinence, as she used THC from \n2018 to as recently as 2022, and only began transitioning from cannabis to her recently \napproved prescription medication for her chronic migraines as of her FORM Response. \nShe did not provide a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse. She also kept open the possibility of using THC again in the \nfuture if her prescription medication was ineffective at managing her symptoms. I find \nthat AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b)(3) are not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H and Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation. I conclude Applicant did not mitigate the drug involvement and financial \nconsiderations trustworthiness concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust \nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. \nAdministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02- \n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

The record reflects Applicant had been residing \nand working in Z for approximately nine months when she stopped making payments on \nher debts in the Spring of 2021, which was at the same time she hired the Firm. Hiring \nthe Firm demonstrated she was trying to act responsibly under the circumstances. The \nbankruptcy of the Firm was a condition largely beyond her control, which partially \nimpacted her ability to resolve her debts. She promptly pivoted after the Firm\u2019s bankruptcy \nand initiated settlement agreements, but she has not established a track record of debt \npayments on the settlement agreements. Those SOR debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.j, 1.k, 1.l, 1.m, \n1.u, and 1.v) with a documented payment history have been mitigated. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established.

Prior to the Firm filing for bankruptcy in March 2023 \nthere had been no debts settled by the Firm. After the Firm\u2019s bankruptcy Applicant sought \nsettlement agreements, but she has not established a track record of debt payments. Her \nresolution of the debts at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.l occurred only because of legal action against \nher by the creditor. \nAfter approximately a year in her new position Applicant had delinquent debts \ntotaling over $184,000 (See AG \u00b6 20(e) reduction) and has mitigated or resolved by court \naction just over $16,500 of the total debt. Even if an applicant has paid his or her debts, \nan administrative judge may still consider the circumstances underlying the debts for what \nthey may reveal about the applicant\u2019s eligibility for a clearance. ISCR Case No. 14-02394 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 17, 2015.) \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is established for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f-1i, and 1.q. As an authorized user she is \nnot responsible for the debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is established for SOR \u00b6 1.v. Applicant filed her tax returns on time, \nand she is resolving her tax debt through a payment plan. The record reflects she was \nresolving her tax debt before she received the SOR. \nWhole-Person Concept \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n         \n   \n \n    \n                   \n    \n                     \n                   \n              \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate her \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by her delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.f-1.j, 1.m, 1.q, and 1.u-1.v: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.e, 1.n-1p, and 1.r-1.t: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied \nCharles C.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out, \nin relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information.

ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred a variety of consumer and other delinquencies in recent years. \nThe debts are admitted and established by credit reports in the record. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and \n19(c) apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are ongoing and unresolved. She did not establish \nthat they occurred due to isolated circumstances or that they no longer cast doubt on her \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant refers to a variety of circumstances that impacted her family\u2019s finances, \nincluding job and salary changes, family changes, and a health situation in 2015. \nHowever, she did not provide enough details for me to find that her finances were \nimpacted by circumstances beyond her control.

AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \nWhether through the debt-relief service or otherwise, Applicant did not establish \nthat she has undertaken good-faith efforts to pay or resolve her delinquent debts. This is \ntypically accomplished by documentary evidence of a track record of steady payments \ntowards her debts. Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence of such information. AG \n\u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. \nSince Applicant did not request a hearing, I did not have the opportunity to question \nher about her debts, her efforts and ability to resolve them, or about her overall financial \nstability. I also did not have the opportunity to view her demeanor and thus to assess her \ncredibility. She did not provide any documentation with her SOR response and did not \nrespond to the FORM, so she provided no additional evidence in mitigation. Applicant did \nnot provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concern shown by her delinquent \ndebts. This does not mean that she cannot show such evidence in the future should she \nreapply for access to classified information. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to her eligibility for a security clearance. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.l:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, Applicant did not \nmitigate drug and personal conduct concerns. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation or to hold a sensitive position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 26, 2022, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nreasons why under the drug involvement and substance misuse and personal conduct \nguidelines the DoD could not make the preliminary affirmative determination of eligibility \nfor granting a security clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a security clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or \nrevoked. The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960); Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program, DoD Directive 5220.6 (January 2, 1992) \n(Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, \n2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on October 7, 2022, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record, in lieu of a hearing. Applicant received the file of Relevant \nmaterial (FORM) on December 1, 2022 and interposed no objections to the materials in \nthe FORM. Applicant timely submitted information to supplement the FORM within the \ntime period In his response to the FORM, Applicant incorporated his explanations from \nhis SOR response. To support his claims, he cited his SOR answer with updates through \nDecember 1, 2022, and documented his September 2019 certificate of completion of his \nintensive treatment, his updated December 2022 diagnosis of major depressive disorder \nand Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), with a stable prognosis with continuing treatment, \nan updated diagnosis and prognosis with a noted history of drugs and alcohol abuse in \nfull sustained remission, and character references. Applicant\u2019s post-FORM submissions \nwere admitted as Items 9-15.

He \nclaimed he completed his five-week treatment program for substance abuse in \nSeptember 2019, and continued his treatment sessions until July 2021. He claimed he \nhas cut ties with all drug-using associates and has surrounded himself with others who \nare clean and in recovery. He also claimed to have been clean and sober from drugs and \nalcohol for three years and four and a half months, and attends one to three 12-step \nmeetings a day. He claimed his willingness to submit to random drug testing. And, he \nclaimed to have maintained a security clearance since approximately 1984 with no \ninfractions or issues. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 63-year-old civilian for a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance.

(Item 8) He confirmed he as bean \nusing Crystal Meth since the Spring of 2015 to help him with his Attention Deficit \nDisorder (ADD). (Item 8) Soon after his introduction to the drug, he became addicted to it \nand experienced health issues he believed were exasperated by his use of Crystal Meth. \n(GE 8) He assured that his last use of the drug was in September 2019. To obtain his \nCrystal Meth, he furnished funds three or four times a month to sources he found on-line. \n(Item 8) Some of his sources joined him in smoking in his home; while others did not. \n(Item 8) \nAsked for more information about his use of Methamphetamines by the OPM \ninvestigator who interviewed him, Applicant responded that the drug enhanced his \nsexual experiences, which further contributed to his addiction. (Item 8) While he knew it \nwas wrong to use the drug, he became so addicted to using it that he could not abstain. \n(Item 8) Because the Crystal Meth he used helped him focus, he was able to avert \ndetection and defer his obtaining prescribed medications to address his health issues. \n(Item 8) \nUnable to control his use of Crystal Meth, Applicant turned to drug counseling and \ntreatment with A Clinic in August 2019 (Items 3 and 11) As a part of his intensive \noutpatient treatment program, beginning in September 2019, Applicant was treated with \ncomprehensive detoxification, rehabilitation, and continuing care services in a structured, \nintensive outpatient setting. (Item 11) His rehabilitation phase consisted of 20 to 30 \nsessions, spread out over a period of two months, and included group psychotherapy, \nindividual therapy sessions, and daily administration of Antabuse. (Items 11 and 12) \nAfter completing his intensive care outpatient program in September 2019, \nApplicant entered a continuing care phase with the same A Clinic. (Item 11) This phase \nconsisted of at least 20 sessions of group therapy, in addition to Alcoholics Anonymous \n(AA), Controlled Anonymous (CA), and Narcotics Anonymous (NA) meetings. (Item 11) \nApplicant was credited with successfully completing his substance abuse program \nin July 2021 with a discharge diagnosis of amphetamine disorder moderately severe and \nwas urged to continue with individual therapy and participate in community-based \nrecovery support groups.

(Item 14) \nHealth dangers from Methamphetamine use \nMethamphetamine is a powerful, highly addictive stimulant that affects the central \nnervous system. (Item 4) Crystal Meth is a form of the drug that looks like glass \nfragmented or shiny, bluish-white rocks. Chemically, it is similar to amphetamines, a drug \nused to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHA), as well as narcolepsy, a \nsleep disorder. (Items 4-6) Meth users are at increased risk of contracting infectious \ndiseases, such as HIV and Hepatitis B and C. (Item 4) Methamphetamine uss is known \nto alter decision-making, and it can create cognitive problems in thinking, understanding, \nlearning, and hearing loss. (Item 14) Withdrawal symptoms from Methamphetamine \ncessation include anxiety, fatigue, severe depression, psychosis, and intense drug \ncravings. (Items 4-6) \nApplicant\u2019s updated diagnosis and prognosis \nIn an updated diagnosis and prognosis from a licensed physician affiliated with A \nClinic, this physician diagnosed Applicant with a major depressive disorder and ADD for \nwhich he has been receiving treatment at the A Clinic. (Item 13) This physician noted \nApplicant\u2019s \u201cremote history of drugs and alcohol but is in sustained remission.\u201d (Item 13) \nThe A Clinic physician offered no comments on what continuing treatment and \nmedications Applicant might require to sustain his abstinence from Methamphetamine \nand other illegal drugs for the foreseeable future.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of \nlaw. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These AG guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as considerations \nthat could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation. The AG guidelines include conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of the conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context of \nthe whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period of \nan applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the applicant \nis an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \n5 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n   Drug Involvement \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n                                                        \nThe Concern: The illegal use of controlled substances, to include \nthe misuse of prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent \nwith their intended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to \nphysical or psychological impairment and because it raises questions \nabout a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.

Applicant\u2019s involvement with \nillegal drugs raise security concerns over whether Applicant\u2019s actions reflect pattern \nMethamphetamine use and involvement incompatible with the judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness requirements for gaining access to classified information. \nDrug involvement concerns \nApplicant\u2019s admissions of using Methamphetamine raise security concerns over \nrisks of recurrence as well as judgment issues. On the strength of the evidence \npresented, three disqualifying conditions (DCs) of the AGs for drug involvement apply to \nApplicant\u2019s situation: DC \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \u201dany substance misuse\u201d; 25(c), \u201cillegal possession of \na controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or \ndistribution; or possession of Illegal drugs or drug paraphernalia\u201d; and 25(f), \u201cany illegal \ndrug use while granted access to classified information or holding a sensitive position.\u201d \nTo his credit, Applicant has committed to abandoning all involvement with \nMethamphetamine and has committed to intensive outpatient treatment and participation \nin support groups (AA, CA, and NA meetings) with the support of his sponsor. For over \nthree \nyears, \nhe \nhas \nremained \nabstinent \nfrom \nillegal \ndrugs \n(inclusive \nof \nMethamphetamine) and exhibits no manifest signs or indications of succumbing to any \nrisks or pressures he might encounter to return to illegal drug use in the foreseeable \nfuture. To help him with his focus issues in the future, he will continue to look other types \nof medications to address his ADD issues and avoid any recurrent returns to self-\nmedicating with \nMethamphetamine. Applicant\u2019s \nefforts and commitments are \nencouraging. \nRecognizing his need to set a better example for himself, his coworkers, and his \nfamily he has abandoned illegal drugs and charted a sustained recovery course that \nhopefully will enable him to sustain his abstinence from Methamphetamine.

And, his efforts warrant partial application of three \nmitigating conditions (MCs) of the drug involvement guideline: MC \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), \u201cthe \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d; 26(b), \n\u201cthe individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing \nor avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse \nis grounds for revocation of national security eligibility .  .  .\u201d; and  \n26(d), \u201csatisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including, but \nnot limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of and \nfavorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional.\u201d \nStill, with the combination of addictive use of Chrystal Meth over an extended \nperiod (over four years) while holding a security clearance and his constructive \nawareness of the federal ban on the use of illegal drugs during his years of usage, it is \nstill too soon to absolve Applicant of risks of recurrent use of illegal drugs in the \nforeseeable future. Without additional time to establish a more probative pattern of \nsustained abstinence from the use and purchase of Methamphetamine, none of the \npertinent mitigating conditions are fully available to Applicant at this time. \nWith only three-plus years of demonstrated abstinence from a very addictive drug \n(Methamphetamine), Applicant will require additional time with more corroborating \nevidentiary sources to support his continued abstinence before he can be absolved of \nrecurrence risks. Potentially helpful to Applicant in making his case for sustained \nremission would be earned chips from his AA, CA, NA networks commemorating his \nsustained commitments to long-term recovery from Methamphetamine addiction. \nBecause Applicant\u2019s addictive use of Crystal Meth for many years (2015-2019) \nwhile holding a security clearance violated federally controlled bans on the use and \npossession of the substance, his involvement with the drug falls within the applicable \ncontours of Guideline E as well. Applicant\u2019s habitual use of Crystal Meth while holding a \nsecurity clearance is clearly incompatible with the general concerns expressed in \nGuideline E about an applicant\u2019s failure to comply with rules and regulations, and how \nsuch failed compliance can create questions about the applicant\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.

His laudatory endorsements from his group leader and friends while impressive, \nare not enough to counter his history of addictive drug use while holding a security \nclearance. While this is not a close case, even close cases must be resolved in the favor \nof the national security. See Dept. of Navy v. Egan, supra. Quite apart from any illegal \ndrug concerns the Government may have for the clearance holder employed by a \ndefense contractor, the Government has the right to expect good judgment and \ntrustworthy behavior or sustained periods of time from the trust relationship it has with \nthe clearance holder. See Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507, 511n.6 (1980) \nWhole-person assessment \nFrom a whole-person perspective, Applicant has failed to establish enough \nindependent probative evidence of his overall maturity, good judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness required of those who seek eligibility to hold a security clearance or \nsensitive position. \nWhile Applicant presents with many positive reinforcements from his group leader \nand friends, of his overall reliability and trustworthiness, he lacks a sufficient track record \nof sustained avoidance of recurrent illegal use and purchases of Crystal Meth to facilitate \nsafe predictions he is at no risk of recurrence. \nConsidering the record as a whole at this time, including Applicant\u2019s recognized \ncontributions to the nation\u2019s defense efforts, and granting due weight to the positive \nsteps Applicant has taken to sustain his commitments to avoidance of illegal drug \ninvolvement, there is insufficient probative evidence of sustainable mitigation in the \nrecord at this time to make safe predictable judgments about Applicant\u2019s ability to avoid \nillegal drugs and drug activities in the foreseeable future. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude drug involvement and \npersonal conduct security concerns are not mitigated.

The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on May 10, 2023, and the hearing was held as \nscheduled on May 24, 2023.

He failed to address the allegations under \nGuideline E, which are cross allegations previously alleged. I will adopt Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions to the cross-alleged allegations as his response to the Guideline E \nallegations as well. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is 27 years old. He is married for the second time. He served in the \nU.S. Marine Corps from approximately 2015 to 2019 when he was administratively \nseparated with a general discharge as further explained, infra. He has worked for a \ndefense contractor since June 2020. He has two biological children and a stepchild. He \nis a high school graduate and has taken some college courses. (Tr. 6, 25-27; GE 1)  \nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleged Applicant was charged in January 2021, with \nillegal discharge of a firearm, intoxication, and with carrying a dangerous firearm under \nthe influence of alcohol. He entered a plea in abeyance agreement and was sentenced \nto pay fines and fees, and a term of 12 months\u2019 probation. He was required to abstain \nfrom alcohol consumption during his probation. In about September 2018, Applicant, \nwhile serving in the Marine Corps, was charged with wrongful use of controlled \nsubstances under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). As a result of this \ninvestigation, he was administratively separated from the Marine Corps and received a \ngeneral discharge. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b) \nUnder Guideline G, the SOR alleged Applicant was required to attend an alcohol \neducation class in March 2019. It also cross-alleged the firearm-alcohol arrest from \nJanuary 2021. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.b) \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged Applicant used steroids from September \n2016 to April 2017, while holding a security clearance. It also cross-alleged the \nSeptember 2018 UCMJ offense. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a-3.b) \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR cross-alleged the allegations from SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \nand 3.a.

He testified that he had access to classified \ninformation at the time of his use. He admitted in his August 2020 security clearance \napplication (SCA) that he used steroids from September 2016 to April 2017. He \nobtained the steroids from another Marine. He claimed that he began using steroids \nbecause he was concerned about being able to meet the required physical fitness \nstandards of the Marine Corps. He also received advice from former Marines whom he \nconsidered mentors. They recommended using steroids. He stated that he has not used \nsteroids since this time frame. (Tr. 24-25, 31, 33-35, 40; GE 1) \nWhile Applicant was investigated and interviewed by the Naval Criminal \nInvestigative Service (NCIS) for his steroid involvement, there is no evidence that he \nwas charged under the UCMJ. He admitted receiving an administrative discharge with a \ngeneral discharge under honorable conditions characterization related to his steroid \ninvolvement. (Tr. 25; GE 1, 4) \nAlcohol Consumption. \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by NCIS regarding his steroid abuse, he also \nadmitted drinking approximately 10 beers the previous weekend at a housewarming \nparty. This information was related to Applicant\u2019s command who ordered him to attend \nalcohol-education classes. Applicant attended the classes. (GE 2; Answer to SOR). \nThe second alcohol-related allegation involves Applicant\u2019s criminal arrest in \nJanuary 2021. He stated that he and his family were at a friend\u2019s apartment complex to \ncelebrate New Year\u2019s Eve. The apartment complex was in a residential area. There was \na vacant field close to the apartment complex that Applicant described as about three \nmiles long. He and his friend had been drinking alcohol that evening. At approximately \nmidnight, Applicant and his friend fired a small caliber rifle into the air three to four times \nto celebrate the new year. A neighbor called the police and Applicant was cited for gun \nand alcohol violations, upon which he later entered a plea agreement, supra. (Tr. 36-37; \nGE 1-3, 6-7) \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse. \nAs stated supra, Applicant admitted illegal steroid use sometime between \nSeptember 2016 and April 2017. He was an active-duty Marine then and had access to \nclassified information. His use, while a Marine, resulted in his administrative discharge \nwith a general discharge. He stopped using steroids in 2017.

He is described as an effective team player. He makes an outstanding \ncontribution to the team\u2019s productivity. He documented that he complied with the terms \nof his probation and his 2021 gun and alcohol charges were dismissed. He testified that \nhe has had no further involvement with law enforcement since his January 2021 arrest. \n(Tr. 44; AE A-B) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.

Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for criminal conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted. \nApplicant was investigated for and admitted illegal steroid abuse while in the \nMarine Corps. He was arrested in 2021 on gun and alcohol charges. Both of the above \nconditions apply. \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for criminal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 32 and considered the following relevant: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant\u2019s steroid abuse happened in 2018, and might otherwise be mitigated \nbecause of the passage of time, except for his 2021 arrest, which makes his 2018 \nactions relevant. The common theme with both incidents was Applicant\u2019s bad judgment. \nHe admitted he let others, whom he considered mentors, convince him to use steroids. \nThis demonstrates his poor judgment. He continued to show poor judgment when he \nand a friend engaged in celebratory gunfire, in a residential area, while consuming \nalcohol as recently as 2021. While he successfully completed his probation term in July \n2022, it is too soon to say whether he has been successfully rehabilitated. I cannot \nconclude that additional crimes are not likely to recur in the future. His actions cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and \n32(d) do not fully apply. \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder. \nThe allegation stating Applicant was required to attend an alcohol education \nclass does not state a disqualifying condition and SOR \u00b6 2.a is resolved in favor of him. \nApplicant\u2019s arrest in 2021 on gun charges also involved his use of alcohol at the time. \nAG \u00b6 22(a) applies to SOR \u00b6 2.b. \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for alcohol consumption \nunder AG \u00b6 23 and found the following relevant: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment.  \nApplicant had no further alcohol incidents after his 2021 arrest. He successfully \ncompleted his one year probation, which included abstention from alcohol. AG \u00b6 23 (a) \napplies to SOR \u00b6 2.b. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Those that are potentially applicable in this case include: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant used illegal steroids at various times between 2016 and 2017, while in \nthe Marine Corps and having access to classified information. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and AG 25(f) \napply. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns.

AG \u00b6 26(a) applies. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nApplicant\u2019s steroid involvement and arrest on gun charges demonstrate his poor \njudgment over time. His administrative discharge from the Marine Corps should have \nsent a powerful message that he needed to use better judgment. His arrest in 2021 is \nevidence that he did not respond to that message. His conduct reflects questionable \njudgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. AG \u00b6 16(c) is not \nperfectly applicable because that conduct is sufficient for an adverse determination \nunder the criminal conduct guideline. However, the general concerns about \nquestionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncontained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and 16(c) are established. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nis potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nThe analysis under Guideline J applies equally here. Personal conduct security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s military \nservice and his performance appraisals. However, I also considered that he repeatedly \nexercised poor judgment and failed to follow established rules and laws. Applicant failed \nto provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the criminal conduct and personal conduct \nsecurity concerns. \nOverall the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guidelines J and E. \nHe mitigated the concerns under Guidelines G and H, or those concerns were not \nestablished. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a - 3.b: \nFor Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nParagraph 4, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 4.a - 4.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He admitted to the investigator \nthat he quickly realized that it was not a legitimate business venture, but rather an \nunscrupulous or illegal money wiring scheme. He told the investigator that he did not \nhave concrete proof, but he thought the money was going to ISIS. He admitted that his \nactions were solely motivated by greed.

He stated that he surmised the funds might have gone to \nISIS or the Middle East because the Secret Service was investigating the transactions. \nHe stated that he was honest to the bank manager, in the police report, and to the \nSecret Service. He also stated that he provided the Secret Service with all his emails \nand electronic communications with Ms. C. (Tr. at 29-40, 46-47, 52-53; GE 2) \nApplicant admitted, without explanation, all the SOR allegations. His testimony \nwas inconsistent with parts of the ROIs. He testified that he did not intentionally provide \nfalse information on his SF 86 or during his background interview. He stated that he told \nthe interviewer that the information that Applicant received was false, and the \ninterviewer misinterpreted his statements to mean that Applicant intentionally provided \nfalse information.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process.

AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline A, Allegiance to the United States \nThe security concern for allegiance to the United States is set out in AG \u00b6 3: \nThe willingness to safeguard classified or sensitive information is in doubt \nif there is any reason to suspect an individual\u2019s allegiance to the United \nStates. There is no positive test for allegiance, but there are negative \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindicators. These include participation in or support for acts against the \nUnited States or placing the welfare or interests of another country above \nthose of the United States. Finally, the failure to adhere to the laws of the \nUnited States may be relevant if the violation of law is harmful to stated \nU.S. interests. An individual who engages in acts against the United States \nor provides support or encouragement to those who do has already \ndemonstrated willingness to compromise national security. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 4. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) involvement in, support of, training to commit, or advocacy of any act \nof sabotage, espionage, treason, terrorism, or sedition against the United \nStates; \n(b) association or sympathy with persons who are attempting to commit, or \nwho are committing, any of the above acts; and \n(c) association or sympathy with persons or organizations that advocate, \nthreaten, or use force or violence, or use any other illegal or \nunconstitutional means, in an effort to: \n(1) overthrow or influence the U.S. Government or any state or \nlocal government; \n(2) prevent Federal, state, or local government personnel from \nperforming their official duties; \n(3) gain retribution for perceived wrongs caused by the Federal, \nstate, or local government; and \n(4) prevent others from exercising their rights under the Constitution \nor laws of the United States or of any state. \nI am not convinced by substantial evidence that the transferred funds went to a \nterrorist organization. I am convinced that Applicant knew he was involved in an illegal \nmoney laundering scheme. He did not know if the money was going to terrorists, a drug \ncartel, organized crime, or some other illegal entity, and he did not care. He admitted \nthat he was greedy and did not care who benefitted from the scheme. It is unnecessary \nto establish that the money went to a terrorist organization and that Applicant knew at \nthe time that it went to a terrorist organization. It is sufficient that Applicant believed it \nwas a real possibility that he was helping to fund a terrorist organization, and he did it \nanyway. The above disqualifying conditions are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate allegiance to the United States security concerns \nare provided under AG \u00b6 5. The following are potentially applicable: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the individual was unaware of the unlawful aims of the individual or \norganization and severed ties upon learning of these; \n(b) the individual's involvement was humanitarian and permitted under \nU.S. law; \n(c) involvement in the above activities occurred for only a short period of \ntime and was attributable to curiosity or academic interest; and \n(d) the involvement or association with such activities occurred under such \nunusual circumstances, or so much time has elapsed, that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or allegiance. \nApplicant proved that he valued money over innocent people and the interests of \nthe United States. As indicated in AG \u00b6 3, \u201cAn individual who engages in acts against \nthe United States or provides support or encouragement to those who do has already \ndemonstrated willingness to compromise national security.\u201d None of the mitigating \nconditions are sufficiently applicable to overcome security concerns about Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance to the United States. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \nclearance investigative or adjudicative processes. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a \nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or \nreleases, cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or \npolygraph examination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative;  \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges the allegiance to the United States allegation. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct reflects questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations. The conduct also created vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable. AG \u00b6 16(c) is not perfectly \napplicable because Applicant\u2019s conduct is sufficient for an adverse determination under \nthe allegiance to the United States guideline. However, the general concerns about \nquestionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncontained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and 16(c) are established. \nApplicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to a question under Section 29 of his August 2020 SF \n86 that asked, \u201cHave you EVER associated with anyone involved in activities to further \nterrorism?\u201d I am not convinced by substantial evidence that the transferred funds went \nto a terrorist organization. I am therefore not convinced that the answer was false. AG \u00b6 \n16(a) is not established. SOR \u00b6 2.b is concluded for Applicant. \nI am convinced by substantial evidence that Applicant intentionally provided false \ninformation during his background interview when he described the wire transfers as \npart of a legitimate business venture. AG \u00b6 16(b) is applicable. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur;  \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nApplicant provided additional information to the background investigator, but only \nafter he was confronted with the facts. I am not convinced he was completely honest \nduring any stage of these proceedings. \nThe analysis under allegiance to the United States applies equally here. There \nare not many things that carry the same stigma as helping terrorists. Applicant remains \nvulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. His conduct continues to cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. None of the above \nmitigating conditions are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines A and E in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the security concerns under Guidelines A and E. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline A: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

In her Answer, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.h and 1.j and \ndenied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.k-1.n with explanations. Her admissions are incorporated into \nthe findings of fact. The debts are also established by Applicant\u2019s credit reports from \nJanuary 2022, August 2022, and September 2023. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 61 years old. She is not married, lives with a cohabitant and has \nthree adult children. She completed some community college courses from 1981 \nthrough 1984 and again in 2012, but did not earn a degree. She has been with her \nsponsoring employer since March 2019 and has worked as an inspector since May \n2023. She has never held a security clearance. (GX 1, 6; Tr. 21-25) \nApplicant initially experienced financial difficulties from 2010 through 2015 where, \ndespite consistent employment, she struggled to pay her bills. In April 2016, she \ntransferred from a position with a large company in State A to a new position with the \nsame company in State B. She rented an apartment in State B, but continued to own \nher home in State A. She allowed her son to live in her home in State A at a reduced \nrent. However, the rent and her new salary were not enough to cover the increased \nbills. She withdrew an unrecalled amount from her 401k retirement plan and used credit \ncards in an effort to cover her expenses. (GX 1, 6; Tr. 29-31, 61-62, 76) \nAlthough her financial struggles continued, Applicant was able to purchase a \nvehicle in 2017. Through about February 2018, she continued to work in State B. \nHowever, her monthly bills remained greater than her earnings. She did not like the new \nwork and wanted to be closer to family in State A. She described being overwhelmed \nduring this period.

She was unable to pay all of \nher monthly bills. (GX 1, 6; Tr. 27-30, 42-44) \nDuring this time, she withdrew additional funds from her 401k and did not initially \npay the additional taxes and penalties that resulted. (See discussion under SOR \u00b6 1.a \nbelow). By 2019, she could no longer afford the mortgages on her home.

In late 2021, she initiated a payment plan with the IRS whereby \nan auto-withdrawal of $123 occurs every month. The IRS also offset her refunds from \nsubsequent tax years.

Applicant admitted these \ndebts in her Answer to the SOR and stated she would be requesting a settlement \narrangement with each of the creditors. However, she later testified that she had not \nreached out to any of these creditors because she could not afford to make any \npayments.

(Tr. 26-34, 95, 102-105) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \n\u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThe financial security concern is broader than the possibility that an individual \nmight knowingly compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses \nconcerns about an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to \nprotecting classified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also \nbe irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \nThe adjudicative guideline notes several conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence reflect that she has maintained multiple \ndelinquent accounts and tax debt over several years. All of the above disqualifying \nconditions apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant experienced various financial difficulties since 2010. They increased in \n2016 when she moved to State B and experienced increased monthly bills. After her \nmove back to State A in 2018, she experienced a significant period of unemployment \nand underemployment until starting with her current employer in 2019. Many of her \ndebts alleged within the SOR originate from this period. \nSince securing her current employment, Applicant has made progress toward \nresolving some of her delinquent accounts. She established a payment plan regarding \nher delinquent federal taxes, brought her first mortgage into good standing and resolved \nher utility and cable accounts that were in collection. An additional SOR debt was \nresolved through the completion of a garnishment. \nHowever, Applicant has not issued any payments toward her second mortgage \naccount or communicated with the creditor for over a year. She has also not made any \nrecent effort to resolve her remaining delinquent credit card accounts and medical \ndebts. She testified she lacked funds to resolve these additional accounts, but would \nattempt to resolve these accounts in 2024 when she believed she would have additional \nfunds. Meanwhile, she continued to place a significant amount of her income into her \nretirement. By doing so, she essentially prioritized her retirement over the resolution of \nmany of her long-standing delinquent debts. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(g) are applicable to SOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant\u2019s tax \nproblems were isolated to 2018 following her early withdrawal of retirement funds. She \nhas since negotiated and maintained a payment plan with the IRS for about two years. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) are also applicable to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.i, 1.k and 1.m. \nThe financial difficulties that followed Applicant\u2019s job change in 2016 and her difficulty in \nobtaining full-time employment in 2018 were conditions largely beyond her control. \nAlthough the resolution of SOR \u00b6 1.d occurred through garnishment, she has since \ntaken responsible action to bring her first mortgage current and resolve these additional \naccounts.  \nHowever, AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b) and 20(d) are not fully applicable to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, \n1.c, 1.e-h, 1.j, 1.l and 1.n. Although Applicant\u2019s current financial position has sufficiently \nimproved to resolve some of her debts, she has not made any recent attempts to bring \nher second mortgage current or communicate with any of the creditors regarding these \naccounts. Applicant has not shown responsible action in addressing these additional \ndebts. \nAdditionally, while Applicant\u2019s State A tax debt and medical account in collection \nare not alleged in the SOR, they undercut assertions of mitigation as her financial \nissues remain recent and ongoing. After experiencing variable periods of financial \ndifficulties, Applicant has made progress in resolving some of her delinquent debts. \nHowever, those efforts do not fully mitigate the ongoing financial security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nFor over the last decade, Applicant has experienced an extended period of \nfinancial difficulties. She recently made some progress on her debts by resolving her \nfederal tax issues and agreeing to a modification of her first mortgage. She also had a \ncredit card delinquency resolve through garnishment and paid two utility bills. However, \nshe has not communicated with the remaining creditors, including the second mortgage \non her home, for over a year and not established a plan for paying her substantial \nremaining debs. Her statements about intending to pay and actions, to date, are \ninsufficient to establish good-faith, responsible efforts to resolve the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by her ongoing delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.n: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript on November 2, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. His admissions have been \nincorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, \ntestimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 37 years old. He completed training as an emergency medical \ntechnician in 2005 but was unable to find a job in his field because he did not have \nexperience. He was married from 2005 to 2006, which ended in divorce. He does not \nhave children. He has worked for his current employer, a federal contractor. since January \n2022. (Tr. 32-35; GE 1) \nApplicant testified that in about 2016, after his father passed away, he began \nconsuming alcohol excessively. He would drink to intoxication regularly. He would go to \nbars and have four to five drinks. He kept a bottle of liquor in his car in case he went out \nand did not want to pay for expensive drinks at a bar. (Tr. 42-44, 59) \nApplicant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol in March 2021. \nHe took a breathalyzer and recorded .216% and .221%. Applicant testified that he had \nconsumed liquor in his vehicle after a difficult day at work. He drank it in a parking lot. \nWhile driving, there was a tire tread in the road, and he swerved and lost control of his \nvehicle. He was told he hit a post but did not recall that he did. He was arrested a short \ntime later at a fast-food restaurant. He admitted he was intoxicated when he was arrested. \nHe also had in his possession some pills that were prescribed to him, but the prescription \nwas expired, and he had put them in a smaller container that was unmarked. (Tr. 44-48; \nGE 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) \nApplicant pled guilty to the DUI offense, and the charge of possession of an \nunmarked expired prescription was withdrawn. He was given 18 months\u2019 probation, a fine, \ncourt-ordered alcohol and drug counseling, and he was required to have an interlock on \nhis vehicle for 12 months. He completed all the terms of the probation. (Tr. 48-49; GE 6; \nAE B) \nApplicant credibly testified that this was a wakeup call for him, and he never wanted \nto spend another day in jail. He essentially stopped consuming alcohol after his arrest \nand has only had three or four drinks since then at family gatherings.

He viewed his arrest \nas a life-changing event. (Tr. 35-40) \nApplicant participated and completed alcohol and drug counseling as mandated \nby the court. He was an outpatient and participated in group therapy. He found it very \nhelpful and was provided alternatives to handing stress. He does not crave alcohol. (Tr. \n57-58; GE 5, 6) \nApplicant testified that he was in a toxic relationship with his fianc\u00e9e during the \ntime he was drinking. His mother was ill and passed away in May 2022. He and his fianc\u00e9e \nbroke up and that has had a positive effect on him. He is an only child, and he inherited \nhis mother\u2019s house. He spends his time working on the house. He also has been in a \nstable relationship for the past six months. His girlfriend does not consume alcohol or \ndrugs. Through his commitment to moderate his consumption he has not had any \nproblems related to alcohol. He does not have any in his house, except some cooking \nwine. He has had no other alcohol-related incidents and does not foresee any in his future \nbecause of his abstinence. (Tr. 38-40, 49-52, 54) \nIn about June 2021, Applicant was prescribed medical marijuana, which is legal in \nthe state where he lives. He would purchase it about twice a month. When he completed \nhis security clearance application (SCA), he did not disclose his use because he viewed \nit as a prescription drug, and it was not illegal in his state. When he was confronted by \nthe investigator, he readily admitted he used medical marijuana and was unaware that it \nwas illegal under federal law. He believed he was answering the drug questions on his \nSCA truthfully. I find he did not deliberately fail to disclose his illegal drug use under \nfederal law. (Tr. 40-42, 50-52; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant testified that he had been using medical marijuana regularly for \nrelaxation, anxiety, to help him sleep, and pain management. He explained that at one \ntime he weighed more than 500 pounds and lost weight through surgery. He developed \nback pain due to his weight and that was one of the reasons for his marijuana use. He \nadmitted he did not stop using it immediately after learning it was illegal because he was \nweaning himself off it. During this March 2022 interview with a government investigator, \nhe said he would prefer not to relinquish his medical marijuana card, and he intended to \nuse marijuana in the future. He also said that he was willing to cease using it to keep his \njob. At his hearing, he credibly stated that he will not use marijuana in the future and will \nfind alternative means for controlling his issues. He stopped using it about six months \nago. He said he is willing to destroy his medical marijuana card and not renew it. He fully \nunderstands the importance of remaining drug free. Applicant credibly testified that his \nlife has turned around, and he is ready to move forward. Post-hearing, he provided a \nshredded copy of his medical marijuana card to show in good faith he did not intend to \nuse marijuana again or renew his prescription. (Tr. 42, 50-51, 54-57; GE 2; AE C) \nTwo witnesses testified on behalf of Applicant. Both have served extensively in law \nenforcement for more than 27 years each, including as detectives, investigators, and \npolice officers. Both have extensive experience in investigating narcotics and alcohol-\nrelated offenses. One was his former supervisor before her retirement and the other is \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \nthe current supervisor of security where he works. They were both aware of his DUI \nconviction. They describe Applicant as a model employee. He was never observed being \nunder the influence of drugs or alcohol. He is a punctual, responsible, reliable, \ndependable, and trustworthy employee. They have seen his commitment to his lifestyle \nchange. He has taken full responsibility for his conduct and has learned from it. They \nbelieve that he made a mistake, and he is worthy of a second chance. (Tr. 17-30) \nApplicant provided a letter from a coworker. She believes Applicant is professional, \nreliable, punctual, honest, friendly, and trustworthy. He is serious and conscientious about \nsecurity and following the rules and policies of the employer. He willingly goes above and \nbeyond what is required in his duties. (AE A) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concerns for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naware benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant testified that when he completed his SCA, he believed that because he \nhad a medical marijuana card issued in a state where it is legal, he did not have to disclose \nthis information on his SCA. He later learned during his background interview that use of \nmarijuana is illegal under federal law. I found his testimony credible and find he did not \ndeliberately provide false information on his SCA. None of the disqualifying conditions \napply and I find in his favor under Guideline E, personal conduct. \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse;  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant began using marijuana regularly beginning in about June 2021 after he \nobtained a medical marijuana card. He purchased marijuana about twice a month. At the \ntime he was interviewed by a government investigator in March 2022, he intended to \ncontinue to use marijuana. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence . . .. \nApplicant credibly testified that he no longer uses marijuana. He is using alternative \nmethods to deal with his anxiety and back issues. He said he did not stop using marijuana \nimmediately when he learned it was illegal under federal law because he was weaning \nhimself off it. He stopped using it about six months ago. I am convinced he will not use it \nin the future. He has shredded his medical marijuana card. Obviously, he could obtain a \nnew one, but I believe Applicant fully understands the importance of remaining drug free. \nApplicant credibly testified that his life has turned around, and he is ready to move \nforward. I have considered all of the evidence and find AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) apply. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern for alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following to be potentially applicable: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving under the \ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nand \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nAfter Applicant father passed away, he began consuming alcohol in excess and to \nthe point of intoxication frequently from about 2016 to March 2021, when he was arrested \nfor DUI. He pleaded guilty to the DUI. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom alcohol consumption. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \n\u00b6 23: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations;  \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment or relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and  \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith nay required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant credibly testified that his DUI arrest and conviction served as a wakeup \ncall for him, and he never wanted to spend another day in jail. He essentially stopped \nconsuming alcohol after his arrest and has only had three or four drinks since then at \nfamily gatherings. He no longer wants to drink alcohol and has declined it numerous times \nwhen offered. He viewed his arrest as a life-changing event. \nApplicant participated and completed alcohol counseling as mandated by the \ncourt. He was an outpatient and participated in group therapy. He found it very helpful \nand was provided alternatives to handling stress. He does not crave alcohol. \nApplicant testified that he was in a toxic relationship with his fianc\u00e9e during the \ntime he was drinking. His mother was ill and passed away in May 2022. He and his fianc\u00e9e \nbroke up and that has had a positive effect on him. He spends his time working on his \nhouse. He also has been in a stable relationship for the past six months. His girlfriend \ndoes not consume alcohol or drugs. Through his commitment to moderate his \nconsumption he has not had any issues with alcohol. He does not have any in his house, \nexcept some cooking wine. He has had no other alcohol-related incidents and does not \nforesee any in his future because of his abstinence. I found Applicant\u2019s testimony credible, \nand the above mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines E, G, and H in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence does not leave me \nwith questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under \nGuideline G, alcohol consumption, Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse, \nand Guideline E, personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCarol G.

Applicant \ndiscussed his use and purchase of marijuana from 2012 through 2017. He stated that he \nwill not use illegal drugs in the future because he did not want to jeopardize his security \nclearance and employment with a DOD contractor. He was issued a DOD security \nclearance in February 2018. In October 2022, he reviewed the investigator\u2019s report and \nconfirmed the recounted information was true and accurate.

I do not plan to partake in marijuana \nuse while unacceptable by law. (GE 1) \nIn October 2021, Applicant participated in another background interview. The DOD \nauthorized investigator asked him what his future intentions were for smoking marijuana \nwhich is illegal under federal law. Applicant stated that he does not plan to use marijuana \nin the future, but he might if he feels like smoking it in the moment. He has smoked \nmarijuana recreationally and casually. He could not state with certainty what he may or \nmay not do in the future. He enjoys creating music and being involved in musical projects \nwhere marijuana is usually involved, and he usually partakes in this type of environment. \nIn October 2022, Applicant reviewed the investigator\u2019s report and confirmed the \nrecounted information was true and accurate. (GE 3; Tr. 14, 19-20) \nDOHA sent Applicant interrogatories about his illegal drug involvement. In October \n2022, Applicant responded to the interrogatories, and he listed that from January 2002 \nthrough October 2022, he had used marijuana on approximately four or five occasions. \nDuring the October 2023 hearing, Applicant stated that he last used marijuana in October \n2022, and he does not intend to use marijuana in the future. (GE 4; Tr. 15-18) \nApplicant testified during the hearing that he has matured over the past few years \nby focusing more on his education and career. He does not intend to use marijuana in the \nfuture. He admitted that he is still involved in the music scene and is frequently around \ncolleagues who use marijuana. Although he may not be able to avoid marijuana in that \nenvironment, he has made his boundaries clear to his colleagues and he does not intend \nto participate in the use of marijuana. (Tr. 20-22) \nApplicant admitted that his employer provided annual security briefings, but he \ncould not recall specifically if there was any information provided about illegal drug use. \nHe acknowledged that he had learned from the training that if he were ever arrested for \nviolating the law, for example, he would need to report that adverse information to the \nfacility security officer (FSO).

Sir, in your subject interview in November \n2017, you said you would not use marijuana in the future because you did \nnot want to jeopardize your security clearance or your job.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec.

It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.

See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd.

Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above definition)\u201d; \u201c(c) illegal \npossession of a controlled substance. . ..\u201d; \u201c(f) any illegal drug use while granted access \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto classified information or holding a sensitive position\u201d; and \u201c(g) expressed intent to \ncontinue drug involvement and substance misuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly \ncommit to discontinue such misuse.\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and \n25(g). \nAG \u00b6 25(f) is not established. Applicant held a security clearance; however, there \nis no evidence that he actually had access to classified information. ISCR Case No. 20-\n03111 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2022) (discussing access to classified information). There is no \ndefinition in the Directive defining a sensitive position, and the evidence did not establish \nApplicant\u2019s position was sensitive at the time he was possessing and using marijuana.\n \n \nAG \u00b6 26 lists three conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. To his credit, Applicant voluntarily and \ncandidly disclosed his marijuana possession and use during the security clearance \nprocess. In 2017 he could not state with certainty whether he would, or would not, use \nmarijuana in the future. His indecision is especially troubling because he was aware that \nmarijuana use was prohibited by federal law and could jeopardize his security clearance \nand job. During the hearing, however, Applicant stated that he does not intend to use \nmarijuana in the future because he has matured, and he is more focused on his education \nand career. Although his response provides encouraging and positive information, the \nevidence against mitigation is more persuasive at this time. An individual who acts only \nwhen they have been placed on notice that their security clearance is in jeopardy may be \nlacking the judgment and self-discipline in the long term that is expected of security \nclearance holders when they are not facing an immediate threat. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPossession of a Schedule I controlled substance is a federal criminal offense. \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are contained \nin 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c).

Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: . . . \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(e) personal conduct \u2026that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or \ngroup. Such conduct includes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing. \nGuideline H allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are cross-alleged under Guideline E \u00b6 2.a. \nEach of them is established by the record evidence. Applicant\u2019s drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse reflect questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations. The conduct also created vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, \nand duress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d) are not fully applicable \nbecause the alleged conduct is sufficient and is explicitly covered for an adverse \ndetermination under the drug involvement and substance misuse guideline.

He \nacknowledged his misconduct and is remorseful. I find that Applicant is intelligent, candid, \nand unlikely to use marijuana in the future, but his behavior is too recent to overcome the \npersonal conduct security concerns. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) do not apply for the same \nreasons as set forth in the analysis under Guideline H, above. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines H and \nE are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant has been fully candid about his involvement with marijuana, and he has \nstated that he does not intend to use marijuana in the future.

Applicant\u2019s lengthy \nperiod of marijuana use while holding a security clearance showed poor judgment and \nunreliability. Despite knowing that marijuana use was illegal under federal law, he made \nthe personal choice to ignore the law in effect which prohibited such use. It is \ndisconcerting that Applicant broke the commitment he made in his 2017 SCA to not use \nmarijuana in the future while it is unacceptable by law. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more time without possession or use of marijuana or any other conduct of security \nconcern, and a longer track record of behavior consistent with his obligations, he may be \nable to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness. I have \ncarefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, \nand the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the context of the \nwhole person. Drug involvement and substance misuse and personal conduct security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information.

In his Answer, Applicant admits each of the allegations and provides explanations. A credit report of the Applicant dated December 20, 2022, reflects that each of these debts were at one-time owing. (Government Exhibit 3.) Applicant began working for his current employer in September 2021. Prior to 2014, Applicant was committed to his financial obligations, never overextended himself financially, and he paid his bills on time. Beginning in 2014, and continuing off and on until at least 2021, Applicant encountered extraordinary life events that hindered his ability to meet his financial obligations. To sum up his situation, he experienced a number of serious medical issues that prevented him from working and caused additional financial indebtedness. As a result, he was unable to pay his debts. In August 2014, Applicant suffered from his third hernia injury, a bilateral hernia causing him to be out of work for nearly six months due to the healing process. In February 2015, he suffered complications from his surgery forcing him to be hospitalized for five days, which was diagnosed as an intest",

The action was taken under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective for cases after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 31, 2022, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on January 6, 2023. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 9, 2023, and the hearing was convened \nas scheduled on March 13, 2023.

He has a Master\u2019s in \nBusiness Administration. He is employed by a defense contractor as a Senior Facilities \nPlanner. \nHe is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his \nemployment. \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted to five creditors involving credit card \ndebt totaling approximately $28,434. \nIn his Answer, Applicant admits each of the \nallegations and provides explanations. A credit report of the Applicant dated December \n20, 2022, reflects that each of these debts were at one-time owing. (Government \nExhibit 3.) \nApplicant began working for his current employer in September 2021. Prior to \n2014, Applicant was committed to his financial obligations, never overextended himself \nfinancially, and he paid his bills on time. \nBeginning in 2014, and continuing off and on until at least 2021, Applicant \nencountered extraordinary life events that hindered his ability to meet his financial \nobligations. To sum up his situation, he experienced a number of serious medical \nissues that prevented him from working and caused additional financial indebtedness. \nAs a result, he was unable to pay his debts. \nIn August 2014, Applicant suffered from his third hernia injury, a bilateral hernia \ncausing him to be out of work for nearly six months due to the healing process. In \nFebruary 2015, he suffered complications from his surgery forcing him to be \nhospitalized for five days, which was diagnosed as an intestinal obstruction. This time \nhe was off work, and without medical insurance, which led him to apply for state \nassistance. He was released from the hospital but was not given an explanation for his \ncondition. He still needed medical treatment. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits 3A, 3B, 3C, and 4.) \nIn May 2015, Applicant experienced another intestinal obstruction complication \nand was in the hospital emergency room for 12 hours and still the doctors were \nuncertain as to why he was experiencing the condition. From May to June 2015, \nApplicant saw three surgeons who tried to determine the cause and prevention of these \nintestinal obstructions. Applicant underwent a number of tests and scans and two of the \nthree surgeons were unable to find a cause for his condition. Applicant was still unable \nto work. He felt ill all of the time, he could not eat properly, and he lost 55 pounds. He \ndepleted his savings account to pay for some of his financial obligations.

During the surgery he discovered that the \noriginal hernia was done incorrectly, the mesh had come loose and was strangling the \nsmall intestine. For about six months following surgery, Applicant underwent physical \ntherapy, received multiple injections for pain, and managed his PTSD from the traumatic \nevent. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits 10, 11, and 12.) \nFrom 2016 to 2018, Applicant went back to work but still faced residual pain and \nsuffered from PTSD. \nHe was unable to recover financially, but managed to live \npaycheck to paycheck and paid all of his monthly expenses with minimum payments. \nIn November 2017, Applicant was laid-off of his job due to company downsizing \nand he moved back in with his family who lived out of state. His partner was also laid \noff from her job. By moving back in with his family, Applicant was able to help take care \nof his mother who had breast cancer and went through surgery. She also fell and broke \nher hip. About this same time, Applicant\u2019s partner\u2019s mother was going in for double \nknee surgery. (Tr. p. 55.) At this point, Applicant was soley living on his credit cards. \nMoney was scarce and Applicant used it to buy food, gas, car insurance, utilities, and \nother necessary living expenses. The debts listed in the SOR were last paid in 2017 or \nearly 2018. (Tr. p. 53.) Applicant could not afford to make payments towards these \ndebts. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits 16 and 17.) \nIn 2019, Applicant moved back to California after securing employment. He \nstated that he had planned to start addressing his debts when COVID hit. As a result, \nhe lost his job, and his partner lost her job. From September 2020 to September 2021, \nApplicant was unemployed. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits 18A, 18B, and 19.) \nIn September 2021, post-COVID, Applicant was able to secure a job with his \ncurrent employer. He stated that he is now finally getting re-established and has every \nintention of resolving his delinquent debts. In March 2023, Applicant contacted his \ncreditors to set up payment arrangements to resolve his debts. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit 20.) \nThe following delinquent credit card debt is of security concern: \n1.a. Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $10,347 for an account \nthat was placed for collection. Applicant used this credit card for living expenses and \nrelated matters. In March 2023, he set up a payment arrangement to settle the debt. \nThe agreement requires that he make six monthly payments of $517.38 to resolve the \ndebt. He stated that he may resolve it sooner when he receives his tax rebate, which \nhe plans to use to pay off the remainder of the debt owing. Applicant made his first \npayment towards the debt on March 6, 2023. (Tr. pp. 67-70, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits \n25, 26, and 31.) \n1.b.  Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $8,635 for an account \nthat was placed for collection.  Applicant used this credit card for living expenses and \nrelated matters.

In March 2023, he set up a payment arrangement to settle the debt. \nThe agreement requires that he make six monthly payments of $363.95. He made his \nfirst payment towards the debt on March 6, 2023. (Tr. pp. 72-73, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit \n25, 29.) \n1.d.

In March 2023, he set up a payment arrangement to settle the debt. \nThe agreement requires that he make six monthly payments of $307.50. He made his \nfirst payment towards the debt on March 6, 2023. (Tr. p. 74-75, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits \n25 and 30.) \nApplicant\u2019s partner does not work outside the home. She recently underwent \nfoot surgery and incurred costs of $1,900. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit 24.) She is scheduled \nfor another foot surgery next week. Applicant states that he will pay the costs totaling \napproximately $5,000. He states that he has money to cover these expenses. \nA letter of recommendation from Applicant\u2019s supervisor states that he is a great \nasset to the team who demonstrates great character through his honesty, reliability, \nrespectfulness, trustworthiness, and integrity. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit 42.) \nLetters of recommendation from professional associates and friends of the \nApplicant attest to his professional nature. They describe him as a man of excellent \ncharacter, who is dependable, courteous, caring, helpful, trustworthy, and responsible. \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibits 35, 36, 37 and 38.) \nApplicant\u2019s 2022 year-end performance review reflects that he has been a \n\u201cSuccessful Performer\u201d on the job. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit 41.) \nApplicant\u2019s income tax returns for tax year 2022 shows that he is expecting to \nreceive a refund for a total of $8,242.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18, as \nfollows: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred debt he could not afford to pay. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise the above disqualifying conditions. \nFour Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nCircumstances largely beyond the Applicant\u2019s control were responsible for his \nexcessive delinquent indebtedness, namely his major medical issues, numerous doctor \nappointments, multiple surgeries, and a significant period of downtime in order to heal \nthat took several years to resolve, coupled with the consequences of COVID 19 and its \nrestrictions, and his loss of employment. These devastating events significantly set \nback the Applicant\u2019s financial situation and impacted his ability to pay his debts. Until \nrecently, he has not had stable full-time employment and been able to afford to pay his \ndebts. He is now gainfully employed and focused on resolving his debts. He plans to \nuse his 2022 income tax refund to pay his debts. All of his delinquent debts will be paid \noff fairly soon. He has acted reasonably and responsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant has shown good judgment and reliability. There are clear indications that his \nfinancial problems of the past are being resolved and are under control. \nHe has \ndemonstrated a good-faith effort to resolve his debts. The Financial Considerations \nconcern has been mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. Over the years, \nApplicant has encountered a series of medical problems that have significantly \nimpacted his indebtedness, his ability to work, and to pay his debts. Through no fault of \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Conclusion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhis own, he was also confronted with Covid and the loss of his employment and was \nunable to afford to resolve his past financial obligations. Since becoming gainfully \nemployed, he has recently set up payment arrangements with each of the creditors set \nforth in the SOR. He has already made his first payment, and he plans to follow through \nwith his commitment each month to move closer to fully resolving his debts. In the \nevent that he does not follow through with his commitment, his security clearance will be \nin immediate jeopardy. However, he has demonstrated that he is responsible and uses \ngood judgment. He meets the eligibility requirement for access to classified information. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.e.:  \nFor Applicant \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Department Counsel was ready to proceed on April 26, 2023. The \ncase was assigned to me on May 1, 2023.

Department Counsel offered Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 and 2, which were admitted without objection. She also provided a \nRequest for Administrative Notice (AN), which is discussed below. Applicant and three \ncharacter witnesses testified. Applicant offered no documentary evidence. (Tr. at 17-20, \n93-94.) \nI kept the record open until August 4, 2023, to give Department Counsel the \nopportunity to brief the issue of whether the country conditions of South Korea raise a \nheightened risk security concern. On July 25, 2023, Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s position on the heightened-risk issue summarizing certain facts set forth in \nAN. I marked her submission as Hearing Exhibit I. On the same day, Applicant submitted \na reply in which he restated his position regarding his employment for a DoD contractor \nand his ties to the United States. I marked his submission as Hearing Exhibit II. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 31, 2023. \nProcedural Ruling \nDepartment Counsel requested in its AN that I take administrative notice of certain \nfacts relating to the Republic of Korea (South Korea). She provided a six-page summary \nof those facts, supported by three U.S. Government documents pertaining to South \nKorea. The documents elaborate upon and provide context for the factual summary set \nforth in the AN. I take administrative notice of certain facts included in the Government \ndocuments attached to AN. These facts are limited to matters of general knowledge, not \nsubject to reasonable dispute. They are set forth in the Findings of Fact, below.

They have three children who were born in South Korea in 1999 and \n2004 (twins). Applicant wrote in the e-QIP that his children are U.S. citizens. In April 2001, \nApplicant was honorably discharged from the Army. He has lived in South Korea since \nthen. In 2011 he began working as an aircraft mechanic for a DoD contractor in South \nKorea. He has not previously held a security clearance. He is seeking national security \neligibility in connection with his employment. (Tr. at 24-26, 32-35, 43-45, 50-51, 56; 79; \nGE 1 at 7-19, 24-27, 35.) \nFor a period, Applicant returned to the United States for an Army Medical Board \ndue to a back injury, but then he returned to continue his service in South Korea in about \n1998 to be with his wife. Applicant became a U.S. citizen in 2000. He claimed in the e-\nQIP that he is not a dual citizen of the U.S. and South Korea, but rather is only a U.S \ncitizen. He claimed that he signed a paper to renounce his South Korean citizenship. He \nand his wife has traveled to the United States for three short periods so that she may \nqualify for a resident alien card. (Tr. at 46-49; GE 1 at 8-9.) \nApplicant\u2019s work commute takes about 90 minutes to two hours each way. He gets \nup at 4:30 am and returns home at 6:30 or 7:00 pm. He describes himself as \u201cjust a normal \ndaddy, 51 years old, overweight, and losing hair.\u201d As a result of his work and commuting \nschedule, he does not socialize with anyone at work. He admitted that, with English as \nhis secondary language, he has difficulty with certain words and struggles sometimes \nwith an English dictionary. (Tr. at 26-27.) \nApplicant commented that one reason he would be reluctant to leave South Korea \nand reside in the United States is that there is no gun violence in South Korea, whereas \nhe believes that the United States has significant safety issues with guns. He also noted \nthat he has no family other than his oldest son in the United States. He testified that at \nhis age, it would be difficult for him to adjust to living in a different country. (Tr. at 85.) \nParagraph 1 - Guideline B, Foreign Influence \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted without explanation each of the allegations in \nthis paragraph of the SOR. His testimony regarding the allegations was as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant, Resident of South Korea Since at least 2001.

Applicant has two U.S. \nbank accounts. He has one account in the United States. He has a second bank account \nthrough DoD, which is overseas. His paycheck is deposited in the DoD bank account as \nU.S. dollars. He withdraws the deposit as cash. His wife then converts the U.S. dollars to \nSouth Korea\u2019s currency and deposits the cash in her South Korean bank account. His \nwife also manages their household finances. The funds in his wife\u2019s account represent \nalmost all of their assets.

He opened this account before he became a U.S. citizen. \nHe has no retirement accounts, but he does pay U.S. Social Security taxes. He does not \nown his home in South Korea.

Section 20A of the e-QIP asks, \u201cHave you, your spouse, or \nlegally recognized civil union/domestic partner, cohabitant, or dependent children EVER \nhad any foreign financial interests that someone controlled on your behalf?\u201d (Emphasis \nin originally.) Applicant incorrectly answered \u201cNo\u201d to this question. The Government \nalleged in the SOR that his negative response was a deliberate falsification. In the \nAnswer, Applicant admitted this allegation with an explanation. He wrote that he did not \nanswer the e-QIP question correctly because he did not read the question carefully. He \nfurther explained that a South Korean bank account was necessary in his country \nbecause U.S. credit cards and U.S. dollars are not acceptable forms of payments for any \ntransaction in the country. (Answer at 3.) \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he did not intend to omit the information \nabout the bank account. He believes that he did not read the entire question and \nmisunderstood what the question was seeking. When the investigator who conducted \nApplicant\u2019s background interview explained the question to Applicant, he understood and \nvoluntarily disclosed his wife\u2019s South Korean bank account.

Applicant\u2019s immediate supervisor has known Applicant for about 15 \nyears. They have a professional and a personal relationship. He believes that Applicant \nis trustworthy and reliable. He does not believe that Applicant has any conflicting loyalties \nbetween the United States and South Korea. Applicant\u2019s higher-level supervisor testified \nthat he has known Applicant for about 15 years. They also have a professional and a \npersonal relationship. He testified that, although Applicant lives in South Korea, his \nallegiance is to the United States. A third witness, a work colleague, stated that he has \nknown Applicant for about 15 years. He testified that Applicant is \u201can outstanding guy\u201d \nand is dedicated and trustworthy. (Tr. at 35-42, 65-69, 79-83.) \nSouth Korea \nApplicant and his wife have significant contact with South Korea. Accordingly, it is \nappropriate to look at the current conditions in that country. North Korea and South Korea \nremain technically at war following a 1953 armistice agreement. Bilateral tensions remain \nmoderately high and have escalated to limited confrontations in the past. In the last \ndecade, provocations by North Korea have included ballistic missile tests, nuclear tests, \nand attacks on South Korea-held territory. In 2022 North Korea has test-launched almost \n40 missiles. Industrial espionage remains a high-profile concern relating to South Korea \nand South Korean companies. North Korean actors have increased their cyber \ncapabilities and efforts in targeting South Korea in recent years. \nSouth Korea is overwhelmingly pro-United States. There are approximately 28,500 \nU.S. troops stationed in the country. Nevertheless, there have been periods of increased \nanti-U.S. sentiment due to high-profile accidents and crimes committed by U.S. service \nmembers. Some incidents have resulted in anti-U.S. protest activity. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 - Guideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in AG \n\u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nGuideline B sets forth nine conditions in AG \u00b6 7 that could raise security concerns \nand may be disqualifying in this case. The following four conditions are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal \nconflict of interest. \nI note that the mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign \ncountry is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one \nrelative is a citizen of a foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, \nthis factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could \npotentially result in the compromise of classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, \n2001). \nIn this case, Applicant not only has a wife and mother-in-law who are citizens and \nresidents of South Korea, he also has resided there for most of his life. He also has twin \nchildren who are U.S. citizens, but who reside in South Korea with Applicant and his wife. \nHis wife also has a South Korean bank account that holds most of Applicant\u2019s assets. In \naddition, the facts of which I have taken administrative notice regarding the country \nconditions in South Korea also establish that Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nThis evidence is sufficient to establish the above potentially disqualifying conditions and \nshifts the burden of persuasion to Applicant to mitigate the security concerns. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides six conditions that could mitigate security concerns under \nGuideline B, including the following four conditions, which are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \nand \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nNone of the above conditions have been established. Applicant currently faces a \nrealistic risk of being placed in a position of having to choose between foreign individuals \nand government and the interests of the United States. His loyalties to his wife and family \nin South Korea are significant and his ties to the United States are limited by the brief \nperiods of time he has lived in the United States and had the opportunity to develop \nrelationships and loyalties there. It is not established that he can be expected to resolve \nany conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. Applicant\u2019s contacts and \ncommunications with foreign citizens are neither casual nor infrequent. Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s \nSouth Korean bank account is routine in nature; however, it represents the nearly the \nentirety of their funds, such that it could be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or \npressure Applicant. \nParagraph 2 - Guideline E, Personal Contact \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes the following condition that may raise security concerns and \npotentially be disqualifying in this case. \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nThe Government has not met its burden to prove that Applicant\u2019s omission in the \ne-QIP of his wife\u2019s South Korean bank account in his response to a question about his \nfamily\u2019s foreign financial interests was deliberate. Applicant convincingly established that \nhe misunderstood the question due to his poor English language skills, particularly his \ninability to carefully read and comprehend the lengthy form in English. Most of his \neducation was in South Korean schools and his use of the English language is limited to \nhis work activities. The Guideline E SOR allegation is resolved in favor of Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s potential for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have given significant weight \nto Applicant\u2019s desire as a 20-year-old to immigrate to the United States and to enlist and \nserve in the U.S. Army. I have also weighed his many years of service working for a DoD \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontractor using his skills as an aviation mechanic in service of the U.S. military. I have \nalso considered the highly supportive testimony of his superiors and a co-worker. \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s connections to South Korean are extensive. He admitted that he \npromised his then-girlfriend when he immigrated to the U.S. seeking his U.S. citizenship \nthat he would return to be with her. Fortunately for him and his future wife, the U.S. Army \nhad a need for his skills in South Korea, and he was able to return to South Korea as a \nsoldier. At this time, his only connection with the United States is his oldest son, who lives \nand works there. Applicant has not carried his burden of persuasion to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised by his personal and family connections to South Korea. Overall, \nthe record evidence raises significant questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability \nfor national security eligibility. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for his current employer since January 2022. He is attending college in pursuit of a degree. He has never married, and he has no children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 19, 28; GE 1) Applicant had a sales job from 2008 to 2018 in which commissions were a large part of his compensation. His sales declined as did his compensation, and he had to find another job. He was unable to pay all of his bills and several debts became delinquent. (Tr. at 17-18, 25; GE 1) Applicant paid or settled debts of $80; $1,148; and $1,994. (GE 4-6) These debts were not alleged in the SOR as they were resolved before the SOR was issued. The SOR alleges a $29,476 charged-off loan from a credit union and a $416 debt placed in collection by a cellular telephone services company. Applicant settled the $416 debt for $249, which was paid on December 27, 2022. (Tr. at 23-24; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 4-6; AE A) Applicant borrowed about $32,000 from a credit union in 2016, which he used to buy a boat. The loan was not secured, and there was no lien on the boat. He stopped paying the loan in 2018, and the credit union charged off $29,476. He stated that he contacted the credit union about the debt, but the credit union was unwilling to settle the debt for less than the full balance, and it was unwilling to go beyond 24 months for him to pay it. Applicant stated that he did not have the $1,400 per month that it would take",

He has worked for \nhis current employer since January 2022. He is attending college in pursuit of a degree. \nHe has never married, and he has no children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 19, 28; GE 1) \nApplicant had a sales job from 2008 to 2018 in which commissions were a large \npart of his compensation. His sales declined as did his compensation, and he had to \nfind another job. He was unable to pay all of his bills and several debts became \ndelinquent. (Tr. at 17-18, 25; GE 1) \nApplicant paid or settled debts of $80; $1,148; and $1,994. (GE 4-6) These debts \nwere not alleged in the SOR as they were resolved before the SOR was issued. \nThe SOR alleges a $29,476 charged-off loan from a credit union and a $416 debt \nplaced in collection by a cellular telephone services company. Applicant settled the \n$416 debt for $249, which was paid on December 27, 2022. (Tr. at 23-24; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 4-6; AE A) \nApplicant borrowed about $32,000 from a credit union in 2016, which he used to \nbuy a boat. The loan was not secured, and there was no lien on the boat. He stopped \npaying the loan in 2018, and the credit union charged off $29,476. He stated that he \ncontacted the credit union about the debt, but the credit union was unwilling to settle the \ndebt for less than the full balance, and it was unwilling to go beyond 24 months for him \nto pay it. Applicant stated that he did not have the $1,400 per month that it would take to \npay the full amount over 24 months. He sold the boat for about $18,000. He did not use \nany of the proceeds of the sale to pay the loan, as he needed the money for living \nexpenses. (Tr. at 18-19, 24-29; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 4-6) \nApplicant did not file his federal and state income tax returns for tax year 2018 \nwhen they were due.1 He filed the returns in August 2022. He does not owe the IRS, \nand he is on a payment plan with his state. (Tr. at 29-32; GE 1, 2; AE B-D) \nExcept for the unpaid SOR debt, Applicant\u2019s finances have improved. He \nasserted that he has changed his spending habits since 2018 to ensure that his \nfinances remain in order. (Tr. at 19-23, 27; GE 4-6) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1 The SOR did not allege any tax issues.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems and delinquent debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \nApplicant had a sales job from 2008 to 2018 in which commissions were a large \npart of his compensation. His sales declined as did his compensation, and he had to \nfind another job. He was unable to pay all of his bills and several debts became \ndelinquent, most prominently the loan that he used to buy a boat. Applicant is credited \nwith resolving several debts before the SOR was issued, and he settled the $416 \ncellular telephone services debt on December 27, 2022. That debt is mitigated. \nThe credit union debt is more problematic. Applicant sold the boat for $18,000, \nbut he did not use any of the proceeds to make a payment to the credit union. His \nfinances are better, but it took him to August 2022 to file his 2018 federal and state tax \nreturns, and he is still paying the state the past-due taxes owed for that tax year. \nAG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \nnational security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d There is \ninsufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial problems will be \nresolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. His financial \nissues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. The above mitigating conditions, individually or \ncollectively, are insufficient to eliminate concerns about Applicant\u2019s finances. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

Items 1 through 3 will \nhereinafter be referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 3. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 41 years old. He is married and has two children. He is currently \nattending on-line college courses working towards obtaining his Bachelor\u2019s degree. He \nis employed by a defense contractor as an Inspector. He is seeking to obtain a security \nclearance in connection with his employment. \nThe SOR alleges that: a. from July 1998 to about August 2021, Applicant used \nmarijuana with varying frequency; b. from about 2000 to August 2021, Applicant \npurchased marijuana with varying frequency; c. from about April 2018 to about August \n2021, Applicant purchased and used marijuana after having been granted access to \nclassified information; d. in about August 2001, Applicant was charged with possession \nof marijuana. \nApplicant admitted each of the allegations set forth in the SOR. \n(Government Exhibit 1, Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR.) \nApplicant began using marijuana in high school. Over the years, he has used it \nfor a period, and then stopped for a period, and then started using it again. He has also \npurchased marijuana both in the edible and smoking forms. Applicant normally uses \nmarijuana at home to relax, as he stated that he does not consume alcohol. Applicant \nstated that between 2009 and 2018, he completely abstained from using marijuana. He \nstated that he has stopped using marijuana and last used it in August 2021. \n(Government Exhibit 3.) \nApplicant has worked in the defense industry for about twenty years. He has \nused marijuana with varying frequency for recreational purposes for over twenty years. \nHe began working for his current employer in September 2008. He has also purchased \nmarijuana many times over the course of these years. In 2001, he was charged with \nthe illegal possession of marijuana. On this occasion Applicant was driving home when \nhe was pulled over by the police for not wearing his seatbelt. Applicant had a marijuana \ncigarette in his glove box and was issued a citation. He pled guilty to a misdemeanor \nand was fined $300. (Government Exhibit 3.) \nApplicant first applied for a security clearance in 2009. He was denied a security \nclearance in September 2009, as his interim Secret clearance was revoked. \nHe \nbelieves that he was denied his clearance because he did not turn in the additional \ninformation requested as part of the investigation by the due date.

(Government Exhibits 2 and 3.) \nApplicant stated that while working for his current employer, and at times using \nmarijuana, he has had access to classified information, and for about the past eleven \nyears there have been no repercussions from this misconduct. He has maintained \nexcellent credit, and is a homeowner, an active member of his church community, and \nis a soon to be graduate with a bachelor\u2019s degree in Computer Science. (Applicant\u2019s \nResponse to the FORM.) \nTwo letters of recommendation were submitted on behalf of the Applicant, one \nfrom the Vice President of Human Resources, who is also the Facility Security Officer, \nand the other from the President of the company. Both individuals acknowledge that \nApplicant is an excellent and hard-working employee. \nCollectively, they state that \nApplicant has worked for the company for fifteen years. From the beginning, he has \nshown initiative to learn additional job responsibilities and an interest in advancing with \nthe company. He is dependable, punctual, and maintains a heavy caseload. He goes \nabove and beyond to train others in the department, while keeping up with his workload. \nHe started as a machinist and has been promoted to a management position. He has \ndone an outstanding job in his new position, and is well respected by his colleagues. \n(Attachments to Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains three conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. None of the conditions are applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of the mitigating conditions are applicable here. It is noted that Applicant \nhas signed a statement of intent to abstain from marijuana use in the future. \nHis \nstatement is not convincing considering the fact that his last use of marijuana occurred \nless than two years ago while having access to classified information. Furthermore, \nApplicant\u2019s history reveals that he has used and purchased marijuana off and on from \nJuly 1998 to about August 2021, a period of well over 20 years. His recent use and \npurchase of marijuana from about April 2018 to about August 2021, after being granted \naccess to classified information shows a character defect. He completely disregarded \nFederal law that prohibits the use of illegal drugs, including marijuana. Given his long \nwork history with defense contractors he knew or should have known that his conduct \nwas illegal and against DoD rules and regulations. His conduct shows immaturity and \nraises questions about his ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. \nHe has not shown the requisite good judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness necessary to be eligible for access to classified information. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline E- Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for Personal Conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information.  Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(d) Credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information.  \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, or duress by a foreign \nintelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct includes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s personal, \nprofessional, or community standing. \nThere are conditions mitigating security concerns under AG \u00b6 17. However, \nnone of them are applicable here. \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant claims that he has now stopped using marijuana. However, in the past, \nhe has stopped using marijuana, and then returned to using it again.  Based upon his \nlong history of drug use, and the fact he has ignored DoD policy and procedure for over \n20 years, there is no strong evidence in the record to show that he will be committed to \na drug-free life-style.  Also, the fact that he has used marijuana after having been \ngranted access to classified information is egregious.  None of the mitigating conditions \nare applicable here. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H, and E in my whole-person analysis. Based upon the facts and analysis \nset forth above, Applicant has failed to provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that \nhe meets the qualifications for a security clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse, and \nPersonal Conduct security concerns. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d. \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

I have the ability to stop smoking when \nneeded and can go without but I like the calming feeling in the evening after \na stressful day. It also greatly helps me sleep. \nThis is the only section of the entire process I am worried about. I \nunderstand how my choice to smoke will weight [sic] in as part of the \ndecision. To be 100% honest, I would like to continue to smoke as I believe \nit does not affect my integrity or patriotism. (Item 3) \nSection 23 also asked if, in the past seven years, Applicant had been involved in \nthe illegal purchase of a drug or controlled substance. He responded that he purchased \nmarijuana from September 2001 to November 2021 every few months. He said his reason \nfor purchasing it was because, \u201cTo get marijuana to smoke to help stress and sleep.\u201d \nSection 23 also asked if Applicant intended to engage in this activity in the future, and he \nresponded, \u201cyes.\u201d He said, \u201cI would like to continue smoking so I would have to continue \nto purchase.\u201d (Item 3) \nApplicant disclosed that he participated in counseling as a result of his illegal use \nof drugs or a controlled substance. He reported he was ordered by his employer to \ncomplete an online drug course. He stated, \u201cAfter a positive random test at my previous \nemployer, I had to take an online course about drugs.

(Items 3, 4) \nApplicant was interviewed under oath by a government investigator in March 2022. \nIn his response to government interrogatories in November 2022, he authenticated his \nstatement to the government investigator. (Item 4) \nApplicant told the investigator that he began using marijuana in May 2001 and has \nused it almost daily since then. He likes the way it makes him feel. From May 2001 to \n2010 he used it with a friend and other random people at parties. From 2010 to the date \nof his interview, he used it by himself or with his wife or half-brother. His mother also \nsmokes marijuana, and he uses it with her. He does not use it with any others. He \nexplained he uses it nightly to relax and aid with sleep. He believes it helps him sleep and \nalleviates some of his asthma symptoms. (Item 4) \nApplicant further disclosed that he purchases about an ounce of marijuana from \nhis half-brother every two months for about $200. His last purchase, at the time of the \ninterview, was February 2022. He explained his half-brother is not a marijuana dealer but \nbuys it for personal use and sells it to him. (Item 4) \nApplicant does not believe he experiences any specific stressors that cause \ntension and does not believe he suffers from any anxiety or other condition which could \nbe treated by a medical professional in lieu of marijuana. He has not attempted to try \nother techniques to help him relax because marijuana is effective. He is not specifically \nanxious without using marijuana but enjoys the relaxation he gets from using it. (Item 4) \nApplicant explained that his prior place of employment conducted a random drug \ntest in February 2019, and he tested positive for marijuana use. He admitted his use when \nthe positive results were reported. His supervisor expressed surprise at the positive \nresults. He took an online drug education course required by his employer because he \nwas worried he would be fired. He completed the course, and no further action was taken \nby his employer. He has never received any drug treatment. The course he took did not \ninclude a drug assessment, counseling, or treatment. (Item 4) \nApplicant told the investigator that he does not use any other illegal drugs, except \nmarijuana. He does not associate with any other illegal drug users, except his family \nmembers. Marijuana use has not negatively impacted his work, even when he tested \npositive at his work. It does not impact his physical or emotional health, judgment, or \nreliability. He has never been diagnosed as drug dependent and has never felt dependent \non marijuana and he can stop when he wants to with no difficulties. (Item 4) \nApplicant further reported that he has stopped using marijuana on multiple \noccasions for approximately three months, specifically when he was changing jobs \nbecause of the potential he would have to participate in a drug screening.

If he was required to choose, he would cease using it to obtain \na security clearance. He said his wife would also stop using it, as she only occasionally \nsmokes marijuana with him. He would ensure he was not in the presence of his mother \nor half-brother when they used it but would continue to interact with them because of his \nfamily relationship. (Item 4) \nApplicant said that he has considered whether he should stop using marijuana due \nto his age and because his children are getting older, and the potential health risks. He \nsaid he may stop using marijuana at some point in the long-term future but he did not \nhave a date or a plan to actually stop. He is aware that his use and purchase of marijuana \nare illegal, but he continues use and purchase marijuana because he likes the feeling he \ngets from smoking it. (Item 4) \nApplicant updated his responses regarding his marijuana use and purchase in his \ngovernment interrogatories of November 2022. He was asked if he had used marijuana \nsince March 16, 2022. He stated he had used marijuana from that date to mid-June 2022 \nalmost daily. He then reported he used marijuana from September 23, 2022, to the \npresent (November 3, 2022). He disclosed that on September 23, 2022, he purchased \nmarijuana from a legal dispensary in another state while visiting there. He said he stopped \npurchasing marijuana over the summer for three and a half months because he did not \nwant to make illegal purchases anymore. A question asked if he had in his possession \nany marijuana? His response was that he had \u201csome flower and a bowl in my garage.\u201d \nHe confirmed that he has been with his wife, mother, and half-brother, who all continued \nto smoke marijuana. (Item 4) \nApplicant\u2019s interrogatory responses also included his present employer\u2019s drug \npolicy that employees shall not be under the influence or in possession of a controlled \nsubstance while on the job or on company property. He also disclosed he was drug tested \nby his current employer as a new hire. He said he was not informed as to the results of \nthe test. (Item 4) \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he said he stopped smoking marijuana in \nNovember 2022. He disputed that he had access to classified information. He stated at \nthat time a decision had not been made about his security clearance eligibility. If he had \nbeen granted a clearance, he would have stopped smoking immediately. He stated he \nhad stopped smoking for four months and did not plan to continue to use marijuana in the \nfuture. He further stated he made marijuana purchases over the years and the last was \nin September 2022 from a legal dispensary. He said he did not intend to purchase \nmarijuana in the future.

He stated he has been open and honest about his past marijuana use. He \nsaid that during his interview process he expressed that he would stop smoking marijuana \nas a condition of his security clearance decision. He stated that he stopped using \nmarijuana in November 2022. He stated, \u201cThe combination of this process and my kids \ngetting older has brought much-needed awareness to my use.

In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of\nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances\nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner\ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may\nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises\nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules,\nand regulations. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse; \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant possessed and used marijuana with varying frequency from about May \n2001 to November 2022. In his SF 86 and in his background interview, he expressed his \nintention to continue to use marijuana. In February 2019, he tested positive for marijuana \nduring a random drug screen by his employer. He was charged with possession of \nmarijuana in 2005, pleaded guilty, and was sentenced. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(b), 25(c) and \n25(g) apply. There is insufficient evidence that Applicant had access to classified \ninformation or held a sensitive position while he was using marijuana, as alleged, in part, \nin SOR \u00b6 1.a. AG \u00b6 25(f) does not apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate the security concerns \nregarding Applicant\u2019s drug involvement. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n26 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nApplicant has a long history of using and purchasing marijuana when it was illegal \nin the state where he lived. I will not consider this fact for disqualifying purposes but may \nconsider it in the application of the mitigating conditions, in making a credibility \ndetermination, and in my whole person analysis. Applicant willingly violated the law for \nmore than 20 years. He also admitted to basically gaming the system by refraining from \nhis regular daily marijuana use before he would start a new job where he knew he would \nbe drug tested. After he took the test, he would resume his marijuana use. This does not \nbode well for considering someone\u2019s trustworthiness for eligibility for access to classified \ninformation or a sensitive position. After completing his SF 86 in January 2022, he \ncontinued to use marijuana. After being interviewed by a government investigator in \nMarch 2022, he continued to use marijuana. He last purchased it in September 2022 from \na state where it is legal. Based on his admissions, he continued to use marijuana almost \ndaily until he completed his government interrogatories in November 2022. In his \nresponse to the FORM, he indicated that he stopped using marijuana in November 2022 \nand does not intend to use it in the future. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s long history of use and relatively recent statement of abstinence is \ninsufficient to apply AG \u00b6 26(a). He admitted that in the past, he would stop his marijuana \nuse so he could secure employment and then resume using marijuana. I am not \nconvinced based on his daily use for more than 20 years that it is unlikely he will use \nmarijuana again. In addition, based on his long history of daily marijuana use, even if he \nhas abstained from use since November 2022, it is an insufficient period to conclude that \nhe is totally committed to abstaining from future marijuana use. His conduct casts doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nApplicant admits his drug involvement and states he does not intend to use \nmarijuana in the future but has not provided evidence of actions to overcome his habitual \nuse of marijuana. He claims to have established a pattern of abstinence, but also admits \nthat his wife, mother, and half-brothers are users with whom he associates. He has not \nprovided any corroborating evidence to conclude that marijuana is no longer part of his \nlife, that he no longer associates with those who use drugs, that he has changed his \nenvironment to avoid where drugs are being used, or that he has participated in a drug \ntreatment program. I understand the obstacles of having close family members who use \ndrugs and the reality of attempting to disassociate with them. However, Applicant has \noffered no independent evidence of any efforts he has made to create a drug-free \nenvironment. Based on his history, I am not confident that when relatives are present and \nusing marijuana, Applicant will not participate. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(b) and 25(d) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances.

In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nDespite having $100,000 in liquid assets, Applicant has done nothing to address \nhis past-due debts totaling about $39,845. The evidence is sufficient to raise these \ndisqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAlthough Applicant can attribute his current financial difficulties to periods of \nunemployment, his financial problems are ongoing. Despite having the financial \nwherewithal to address them, Applicant has chosen not to do so. He has not \ndemonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has \nnot been established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial \nConsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

On May 3, 2023, a complete copy of the FORM was sent to Applicant, \nwho was requested to provide answers to the additional allegations in her Response to \nthe FORM. Additionally, she was given an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s evidence. She submitted her \nResponse to the FORM on June 16, 2023. The case was assigned to me on September \n28, 2023. \nThe SOR (FORM Item 1) and the Answer (FORM Item 2) are the pleadings in the \ncase. FORM Item 3 the SCA, FORM Item 4 (Interrogatories dated October 18 & 27, 2022), \nFORM Item 5 (Interrogatories dated July 13, 2022), and FORM Item 6 (Notice of \nDisciplinary Action, October 2021), as well as Applicant\u2019s exhibits included with her \nAnswer and Response are admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant\u2019s exhibits \ncited in the decision will identified as either Answer or Response at the applicable page \nnumber. \nThe Government in its FORM requested that the Administrative Judge take \nadministrative notice of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Substance \nAbuse and Mental Health Service Administration's (SAMHSA) position that passive \nexposure to a drug (e.g., second-hand marijuana smoke) is not a legitimate medical \nexplanation for a positive marijuana test result under the Mandatory Guidelines and \nprovided two documents (SAMHSA 1 and 2) in support of that position. Applicant \nsubmitted reports/articles from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The NIDA report/article notes that \nthere have been many studies of the effects of passive inhalation of marijuana and that \none study \u201cfound that some nonsmoking participants exposed for an hour to high-THC \nmarijuana (11.3% THC concentration) in an unventilated room showed positive urine \nassays in the hours directly following exposure.\u201d The CDC article discusses the impacts \nof secondhand marijuana smoke on infants and notes that some studies have found \nstrong associations between reports of someone in the child\u2019s home using marijuana and \nthe child having detectable levels of THC but does not address whether the THC is \ndetectable in the child\u2019s blood or urine or whether any THC detected could rise to the level \nnecessary to result in a positive urinalysis for marijuana. The Government\u2019s request for \nadministrative notice is granted. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant's Answer to the SOR and in her Response to the FORM including the\nadditional SOR allegations, she denied falsifying her answers on her SCA, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-\n1.d, and denied that she had been terminated by her previous employer, SOR \u00b6 1.e. She\nadmitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.b and denied SOR \u00b6 2.c. She admitted SOR \u00b6 3.a. Her admissions\nare incorporated in my findings of fact.

Previously she had been employed by a defense contractor from \nMarch 2011, subject to intermittent periods where her status was in dispute, until October \n2021. (Answer at 22; Item 3 at 7, 13.) She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in August 2018. \nShe has never held a security clearance. She has never married. (Item 2 at 12, 17, and \n32.) \nIn her July 2021 SCA, Applicant denied any illegal drug use or drug activity. She \nlisted a single employer from 2011 to the present. During her personal subject interview \n(PSI), she admitted that she voluntarily used marijuana on several occasions in the seven \nyears prior to certifying her SCA, and detailed various employers and breaks in \nemployment not listed in her SCA. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: Falsified material facts in response to interrogatories dated \nOctober 27, 2022. Applicant asserted in her interrogatory response that the positive \nurinalyses alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b were the result of secondhand smoke inhalation. \nShe provided two Federal reports with her Answer to support her assertion, the first from \nNIDA and the second from the CDC. The NIDA found it was possible in an unventilated \nroom to test positive urine assays in the hours directly following exposure and the CDC \nconsidered that someone using marijuana in a child\u2019s home could result in the child having \ndetectable levels of THC but the CDC does not address whether the THC is detectable \nin the child\u2019s blood or urine stating people exposed to secondhand marijuana smoke can \ntest positive on a urinalysis in the hours directly following exposure studies. (Answer at \n13, 17.) She did not detail how her environment was akin to the studies she provided. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: Falsified material facts on an SCA dated July 14, 2021, pertaining \nto \u201cSection 23-Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity\u201d when you stated \u201cNo\u201d to \nwhether you had illegally used drugs or controlled substances in the last seven \nyears. Applicant in her Response wrote \u201cYes, I said no on my [SCA] because at the time \nI didn't remember doing any kind of drug.\u201d She notes she admitted to two occurrences of \ndrug use in her PSI which details the various instances where she smoked or consumed \nmarijuana. (Item 4 at 8-9.) In her Response she stated \u201cI said no on my [SCA] because \nat the time I didn\u2019t remember doing any kind of drug. At the time of my interview on page \n8 of the interrogatories I did in fact mention 2 different occurrences.\u201d (Response.) She \nalso had tested positive for marijuana on a urinalysis conducted in March 2021. (Item 4 \nat 9, 17; Answer at 5.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: Falsified material facts on an SCA dated July 14, 2021, pertaining \nto \u201cSection 13A \u2013 Employment Activities\" wherein you listed your dates of \nemployment at Company A as continuous from March 2011 to the present. Applicant \ndenied this allegation. Applicant was employed by Company A from March 2011 until \nSeptember 2020, when she was terminated for having a firearm on company property. \nShe failed to disclose her employment with Company B from October 2020 to March \n2021. (Item 4 at 7.) In March 2021, she was hired by Company C. (Item 4 at 7.) In her \nAnswer she admits that she was also briefly employed by Company C, and in her PSI, \nshe details the events surrounding her brief time with Company C.

She states that she was reinstated with Company A without backpay. (Item \n4 at 6.) In her Response she explains that she was told by her union representative that \nher \u201ctime would be bridged, making it look more like a six-month suspension.\u201d \n(Response.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: Tested positive for marijuana in March 2021, during a pre-\nemployment drug screening/urinalysis for a job with Company C, an employment \nactivity that you did not disclose on an SCA executed by you on or about July 14, \n2021. In her Response Applicant denied the allegation on the basis it was a not a \ncompany test but an in-house test. (Response at 2.)  She explains in her Answer and PSI \nthat she had tested positive during the preemployment screening process for Company \nC due to exposure to secondhand marijuana smoke and that Company C had let her \n\u201ccome on board with this explanation.\u201d (Answer at 5; Item 4 at 9, 17.) The investigator \nnoted she hesitated when asked if she had a positive urinalysis test and then she \nresponded yes to testing positive for marijuana. She told the investigator she had been \nexposed to secondhand marijuana smoke. (Item 4 at 9.) She explained in her Response \nthat the sample she provided showed a negative result based on the test\u2019s standards, but \nher employer indicated a laboratory test could be positive because of faint presence. (Item \n4 at 9.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: Terminated from employment at Company A in October 2021 after \ntesting positive for marijuana during a urinalysis administered by your employer \nimmediately after being involved in a motor vehicle accident on company grounds \nin September 2021. Applicant in her Response discusses the positive urinalysis. She \nstated that she \u201chates the fact that it happened\u201d and her choice to party showed less than \nperfect judgment. (Response.) She offers that she does not party anymore and now she \ngoes to work and goes home but that \u201csometimes [she] might relax with close friends, but \nnot that often.\u201d (Response.) \nSOR \u00b6 2.a: On or about March 2021, you tested positive for marijuana on a \nurinalysis test administered by your employer. Applicant admitted this allegation. In \nher Answer she stated she disclosed to Company C she might test positive and noted the \nurinalysis she took \u201cwas barely a positive.\u201d (Answer at 5.) She claimed that she had tested \npositive due to exposure to secondhand marijuana smoke and that Company C had let \nher \u201ccome on board with this explanation.\u201d (Item 4 at 9, 17; Answer at 5.) She provided a \nstatement from Company C stating: \u201cAs per our organization's policies and procedures, \nall prospective employees are required to undergo a thorough pre-employment screening, \nwhich includes a drug screening. However, in the case of [Applicant] her employment \nduration was exceptionally short, spanning only from March 8, 2021, until March 15, 2021. \nGiven the brevity of her employment [Applicant] did not require or undergo the pre-\nemployment drug screening process.\u201d (Response at 12.)  \nSOR \u00b6 2.b: On or about September 2021, you tested positive for marijuana \non a urinalysis test administered by your employer.

In her Answer she \nstated it was possible that she may have consumed an edible at a party. She explained \nthat \u201cat the party people can bring whatever they want, it's not far-fetched to say that some \nof the desserts and food served had a little extra something in it, l would never know, I \ndidn't feel anything, l was already drinking.\u201d She also cited her \u201csweet tooth\u201d and a \nfondness for brownies and noted that she could \u201cdown a whole cookie tray\u201d (Answer at \n5.) She added that she was around people who were smoking marijuana and was \n\u201cbreathing in contaminated air.\u201d (Answer at 5.) \nSOR \u00b6 2.c: From at least August 2014 to at least September 2021, you used \nmarijuana with varying frequency. Applicant acknowledged in her PSI that she had \nused marijuana on at least \u201ctwo occasions she could recall.\u201d She acknowledged trying \nmarijuana edibles and a marijuana lollypop that her family brought back from Europe. She \ndescribed taking a marijuana cigarette from a neighbor when she was experiencing a very \nbad migraine. (Item 4 at 9.) She tested positive on a urinalysis taken after a workplace \naccident in September 2021. She completed her SCA in July 2021. (Item 3; Item 4 at 9; \nItem 6 at 4.) \nSOR \u00b6 3.a: You are indebted to the Federal Government for delinquent taxes \nin the amount of $6,212.64 for tax year 2017. As of the date of this statement of \nReasons, the taxes remain unpaid. In her Answer, Applicant admitted the allegation, \nand said that she had reduced the debt to about $1,800, that she had an arrangement \nwith the IRS to apply her income tax refunds to the debt, that she expected to significantly \nreduce or resolve the remaining debt with her tax year 2022 refund, and if the refund was \ninsufficient to resolve the debt, that she would pay the remaining balance. (Answer at 2, \n6.) She submitted documentary evidence that her income tax overpayments for tax years \n2019 through 2022 were applied by the IRS to her 2017 tax year debt including accrued \npenalties, and that after the IRS applied her $1,346 overpayment for tax year 2022. As of \nher Response her remaining debt balance was $499. She did not provide documentary \nevidence of voluntary payments or of an arrangement or payment plan with the IRS. \n(Answer at 6, 13; Item 4 at 10; Item 5 at 11; Response at 3, 13.)  Based solely upon the \nsignificant reduction in the tax debt through IRS recoupment of her tax refunds I find for \nApplicant on SOR \u00b6 3.a. \nApplicant cites the actions she has done to get her finances and lifestyle in order. \nShe acknowledges she made \u201ca mistake and got stung\u201d and she is \u201cstill feeling the pain \ntoday.\u201d She has \u201ckicked out\u201d the people who lived in her home that were smoking \nmarijuana. She states she \u201cwon't even be around it or put myself into a situation to be \nexposed again. I already know what it's like to lose just about everything you've worked \nhard for behind marijuana.\u201d (Answer at 6; Response.) She notes her finances are getting \nbetter and that she had reduced her tax debt to just under $500 \u201ceven though everything \nis getting costly.\u201d She included multiple letters from friends in her Response attesting to \nher character, as well as a letter from her current supervisor who noted she had \ndemonstrated integrity and trustworthiness.

(Response at 5-11, \n14, 15.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nApplicant's intentional failure to disclose the full extent of her marijuana use in her \nSCA (two admitted uses of marijuana and a positive urinalysis), her failure to disclose her \nemployment status in her SCA, and conduct in the workplace raise the following \ndisqualifying conditions: \nAG \u00b616(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \nAG \u00b616(b): deliberately providing false or misleading information; or \nconcealing or omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an \nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity eligibility determination, or other official government representative; \nand \nAG \u00b616 (e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nby a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group.

While the PSI reflects, she hesitated regarding the incident alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.d she admitted the circumstances. \nApplicant has maintained her theory of secondhand smoke inhalation throughout \nthe security clearance application process. Given these facts it appears that there may \nbe some question as to her knowledge and intent to deceive with regard to SOR \u00b6 2.a. \nHer intent to deceive is clear regarding SOR \u00b6 2.b. AG \u00b6 17(a) is not applicable to SOR \n\u00b6 1.a. Her explanations regarding her continuous employment history with Company A \nwere revealed under questioning. AG \u00b6 17(a) is not applicable to SOR \u00b6 1.c. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. Applicant's false statements concerning her drug \nuse and employment history, SOR \u00b6 1.b and SOR \u00b6 1.c, were arguably \u201cinfrequent,\u201d but \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthey were not \u201cminor,\u201d because such statements strike at the heart of the security \nclearance process.

An applicant \nwho deliberately fails to give full, frank, and candid answers to the government in \nconnection with a security clearance investigation or adjudication interferes with the \nintegrity of the industrial security program. ISCR Case No. 01-03132 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. \n8, 2002). Applicant's false statements were recent and calculated to give her the most \nfavorable hiring profile because they involved the current adjudication of her application \nfor a security clearance. AG \u00b6 17(c) is not established for SOR \u00b6 1.e. The accident in the \nworkplace while having marijuana in her system casts doubt on her reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17 (d) and AG \u00b6 17 (e) are not established. Applicant after her second positive \nurinalysis, SOR \u00b6 1.e, may have removed the persons who smoked marijuana from her \nhome and stopped partying but there is insufficient time given her actions and \nassociations prior to her second positive urinalysis to mitigate SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admission in her Answer to the SOR and the information in the FORM \nare sufficient to raise the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n25(a): \u201cany substance misuse (see above definition)\u201d; and (c) \u201cillegal possession of a \ncontrolled substance, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or \ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.\u201d \nApplicant has not rebutted lack of knowledge. She admitted using marijuana on at \nleast two occasions, tested positive twice, informed the labor relations representative \npresent at the September 2021 urinalysis it was likely that she would test positive for \nmarijuana, lived and associated with marijuana users, consumed edibles that she had \ngood reason to believe contained controlled substances, lied about using marijuana, and \nher passive inhalation claims are not credible. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. Applicant admitted using marijuana on at least two \noccasions. Additionally, she acknowledged testing positive on two different urinalysis \ntests for marijuana, March 2021 and September 2021 respectively. The second positive \nurinalysis was the result of an ordered urinalysis after her job site accident. She told a \ninformed the labor relations representative she would likely test positive for marijuana, \nand she did. The urinalysis was administered while her July 2021 SCA was being \nprocessed. Her secondhand smoke exposure and innocent ingestion claims are not \ncredible. The Appeal Board has \u201clong held that applicants who use marijuana after having \nbeen placed on notice of the security significance of such conduct may be lacking in the \njudgment and reliability expected of those with access to classified information.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 20-01772 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 14, 2021). See also ISCR Case No. 21-02534 at \n4 (App. Bd. Feb. 13, 2023) (\u201c[A]fter applying for a security clearance and being adequately \nplaced on notice that such conduct was inconsistent with holding a security clearance, an \napplicant who continues to use marijuana demonstrates a disregard for security clearance \neligibility standards, and such behavior raises substantial questions about the applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d) \nThe Appeal Board has also stated the Administrative Judge is tasked to resolve \napparent conflicts in the evidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-00281 at 4 (App. Bd. \nDec. 30, 2014). In this case Applicant raises whether she knowingly used or consumed \nmarijuana. Applicant has admitted using marijuana and not disclosing it on her SCA, \nwhich diminishes her credibility. Before her September 2021 urinalysis she told the labor \nrelations representative present she would likely test positive for marijuana, and after \ntesting positive for marijuana, she said that marijuana may have been in an edible or in \nfood she consumed at a party where people were smoking marijuana. I conclude she \neither knew or reasonably should have known or suspected under the circumstances that \nmarijuana was present in the food she consumed. See ISCR Case No. 22-01176 (App. \nBd. Oct. 24, 2023). \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is not established. Applicant acknowledges her use in her PSI. Her \nsupporting documents allow her to make her Response argument that her two positive \nurinalysis tests could have been from exposure to secondhand marijuana smoke.

She stated her \nintention to no longer be associated with marijuana users and her intent to abstain from \nall drug involvement and substance misuse. She did not offer a letter of intent to abstain. \nor evidence of abstinence or actions taken to overcome the problem, except for a general \nletter about care and concurrent therapy the credibility concerns with this Applicant are \nrelevant to uncorroborated pledges. While she is acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility, she does \nnot precisely incorporate all the terms of AG \u00b6 26(b)(3). \nSomeone who picks and chooses what laws she will follow is not a good candidate \nfor a security clearance. Applicant does not currently hold a security clearance. Her recent \nacknowledgement of her mistakes and poor judgment and assurance she will do \nwhatever it takes to be granted a security clearance does not generate confidence that \nshe has not continued to use illegal drugs or that she will not use them in the future. None \nof the mitigating conditions are applicable, and Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use is not \nmitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nApplicant in her Response provided various character letters, which attested to her \nintegrity, trustworthiness, resiliency, and positive nature, as well as the correspondence \nfrom her therapist, which I have considered. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines E, H, and F in my whole-person analysis and applied the adjudicative factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested a determination on the record without a \nhearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate her credibility and sincerity based on demeanor. \nSee ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd.

She told the investigator she never \nplaced her loans in deferment or applied for forbearance and had never taken action to \nrepay her loans. (Item 4 at 5 and Item 5 at 2.)

Her Answer infers \nthat she received the letter, but no letter was included in Answer. The February 2023 \ncredit report shows her education loans as paid as agreed. (Item 6.) \nIn March 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the President directed the\nDoED to provide the following temporary relief on Department of Education (DoED)-\nowned federal student loans: suspension of loan payments, stopped collections on \ndefaulted loans, and a 0% interest rate. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, \nand Economic Security Act (CARES Act) provided for the above relief measures through \nSeptember 30, 2020. See Federal Student Aid (FSA) website, ISCR Case No. 20-02787 \nat 3 n.1 (App. Bd. Mar. 2022). This student loan debt relief has been extended several \ntimes.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified information.

Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.

It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports and admissions establish two disqualifying conditions \nunder this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a): \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d, and AG \u00b6 19(c): \u201ca history of \nnot meeting financial obligations\u201d. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant's delinquent debts are recent, numerous \nand ongoing. She provided no evidence to support the plan in her Answer to resolve her \nstudent loans or provide evidence of payment concerning the other delinquent debts that \nshe indicated would be resolved on or after a specified date. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant cited having to replace her car but there \nis no supporting evidence of any circumstances beyond her control in the record. There \nis no evidence that her former boyfriend was responsible for the delinquent utility debts. \nShe did not provide evidence to support her claims that she acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances to resolve her debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are ongoing and unresolved.

Jun. 7, \n2021) She did not establish that her financial problems are in the past and are unlikely to \nrecur. She cites without evidence that she has established a plan to resolve her financial \nproblems. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). She has failed \nto establish that she has made a good-faith effort to pay or resolve her debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) \ndoes not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered her statements, which she \nattributed to others, concerning her trustworthiness, good judgment, and reliability in my \nwhole-person analysis. Because Applicant requested a determination on the record \nwithout a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate her credibility and sincerity based on \ndemeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by Guideline F. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant a security clearance.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 41 years old. He has some college credits. He served in the military in the 1990s. He and his wife have been married since 1995. They have two grown children. He has been employed with a defense contractor since 2008 and indicated on his SCA that he has held a clearance since 2011. He lives in State 1. In March 2021, City 1, State 1 police received a cyber tip from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) and Google regarding possible child pornography on an account linked to Applicant. His name and e-mail addresses were on the account, and they were linked to an internet service provider (ISP) address under his name at the address in City 1, State 1. When the warrant was executed, several family members were there but Applicant was not. He was contacted by police, told about the search warrant, and was requested to come to the premises, which he did.

He requested a decision by an \nadministrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) based \non the administrative (written) record, in lieu of a hearing. On May 17, 2023, Department \nCounsel submitted the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM), including \ndocuments identified as Items 1 through 7. Applicant was afforded an opportunity to \nnote objections and to submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation, and was \ngiven 30 days from receipt of the FORM to do so. On June 21, 2023, DOHA received a \nresponse from Applicant. (FORM Response) The response includes four letters, which \nare marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through D. \nThe case was assigned to me on September 11, 2023. Government Items 1 and \n2, the SOR and the Answer, respectively, are the pleadings in the case. Items 3 through \n7 are admitted without objection. Applicant\u2019s FORM Response and AE A through D are \nalso admitted without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied SOR \u00b6 1.a and the two cross-\nallegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 3.a). He also provided a narrative statement. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \nApplicant is 41 years old. He has some college credits. He served in the military \nin the 1990s. He and his wife have been married since 1995. They have two grown \nchildren. He has been employed with a defense contractor since 2008 and indicated on \nhis SCA that he has held a clearance since 2011. He lives in State 1. \nIn March 2021, City 1, State 1 police received a cyber tip from the National \nCenter for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) and Google regarding possible \nchild pornography on an account linked to Applicant. His name and e-mail addresses \nwere on the account, and they were linked to an internet service provider (ISP) address \nunder his name at the address in City 1, State 1. When the warrant was executed, \nseveral family members were there but Applicant was not. He was contacted by police, \ntold about the search warrant, and was requested to come to the premises, which he \ndid.

The minors appeared to [range] in age from 7-8 to 13-14. \n(Item 4 at 2 (Police incident report)) \nThis City 1 police incident report led to a search warrant signed and issued by a \njudge. The warrant was executed at the address, which led, in turn, to Applicant\u2019s \ndetention and interview at the police station. His cell phones were secured. He was \ngiven a Miranda warning and waived his rights and agreed to speak to police. (Item 4) \nApplicant confirmed his name, date of birth, phone number, ISP, and three \nseparate email addresses. He denied being \u201cinto kiddy porn.\u201d He was asked about \nspecific photos with sexually explicit descriptions referencing girls aged 9, 11, and 12. \nAccording to the police report, Applicant said he \u201cwould download it to see what it was \nand then delete it.\u201d (Item 4 at 3) \nApplicant was then placed under arrest. Forensic examination revealed that his \nphone contained file names that matched the cyber tips from the NCMEC, and \nApplicant\u2019s name and one of his e-mail addresses. Another search warrant was then \nexecuted at the home. (Item 4 at 3-4) \nOn his SCA, Applicant reported that he lived at the address in question from\nabout May 2007 to about December 2020 \u201cuntil my father\u2019s health declined.\u201d (Item 3 at \n9) He disclosed the arrest on his July 2021 SCA. He noted that the case remained \npending action from a grand jury. He also said, \u201cthere was a tip from Google that some \nobscene photos were downloaded to my router. My account has been hacked multiple \ntimes and there is no evidence other than a tip from Google.\u201d He said he had informed \nhis employer\u2019s security office. (Item 3 at 27) \n \nIn September 2021, Applicant had a background interview relating to his \nclearance application. In discussing his April 2021 arrest, he asserted that his Gmail \naccount had been hacked many times during 2020 and early 2021. At the time of the \nwarrant, his daughter and her fianc\u00e9 lived at the residence in question with their new \nbaby. He said his lawyer had explained that he had been charged because the Google \ntip had been traced to a modem and IP address that was registered in his name. \nApplicant acknowledged that he paid for the internet service in the home. (Item 7 at 3-5) \nIn discussing the police interview, Applicant said he denied downloading anything \ninappropriate. He said anyone at the home, such as his daughter, her fianc\u00e9, or any \nvisitors, would be able to access the Wi-Fi network even though it was password \nprotected. He was told by police that the downloads occurred in December 2020, which \nwas right when he moved out of the home and allowed his daughter and fianc\u00e9 and \ntheir new baby to move in. He was caring for his father who was in poor health and in \nhospice care.

Grand \njury action on his case remained pending. Applicant said he had \u201cnever downloaded \nanything that was known to be illegal.\u201d He said his grandson (12 years old at the time of \nthe warrant) \u201cused to play on my phone and computer often.\u201d (Item 5 at 2) \nIn discussing his police interview, Applicant said he told the police that \u201cI had not \ndownloaded anything like that on my devices. I did admit that I have downloaded normal \nadult pornography sometimes and that if anything was ever questionable it was deleted \nimmediately to remove any question.\u201d He also said that due to his family history, he had \n\u201czero tolerance for people doing anything with children.\u201d (Item 5 at 3) \nOn January 26, 2023, Applicant pled guilty to the offense charged, i.e., \npossession of obscene matter. Applicant was sentenced to a 10-year jail term, to be \nsuspended for two years, with Applicant placed on two years of probation. He was fined \nand ordered to pay fees and court costs. He was also required to register as a sex \noffender under the State 1 Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. (Item 6) \nIn addressing the SOR allegations in his Answer, Applicant said he \u201cwas not the \none that committed the infractions listed.\u201d His daughter and her fianc\u00e9 had moved into \nthe home with his son and two daughters. He asserted that the fianc\u00e9\u2019s son \u201chad \ndownloaded pictures on my phone that he had found on Twitter, Instagram, and other \nsuch sites.\u201d Applicant had confirmed to the police that Applicant had previously \ndownloaded adult images \u201con commercial, age-verified sites\u201d (i.e., adult pornography) \nbut he denied downloading child images (i.e., child pornography). He asserted that this \nwas because his wife had previously been sexually assaulted by a family member and \nthat he is protective of his wife and daughters. He asserted that his daughter\u2019s fianc\u00e9\u2019s \n12-year-old son had admitted downloading the images. (Answer) \nApplicant asserted that he pled guilty because there was a guarantee of no \nprison time, and no further action would be taken. A trial would risk the jury that \u201cwould \nwant to go after him just based off of the charges\u201d and the risk that he would be seen to \nbe \u201ctrying to throw [his grandson] under the bus to stay out of trouble.\u201d (Answer) \nIn his FORM Response, Applicant again said that \u201cI never downloaded any \nmaterial such as I was accused.\u201d He acknowledged downloading adult pornography \nfrom age-verified sites and he would delete any images of any females who looked \nyounger (16-18). He said he would never download \u201csomething that was of a child.\u201d \n(i.e., child pornographic images). He asserted that during the investigation he was \nconcerned that it may have been his son-in-law or grandson (then age 12) who had \ndownloaded the images, and that the grandson admitted weeks later that he had \ndownloaded the images but deleted them for fear of getting into trouble. Applicant said \nhe took a plea because of the risk of jail time and of possible charges against his \ngrandson. (FORM Response) \nApplicant acknowledged that it was his responsibility and that of his son-in-law to \nmonitor what Applicant\u2019s grandson was doing on the devices.

He served in the military and has never had a security \nviolation. (FORM Response) \nApplicant\u2019s FORM Response included letters from his wife and his mother, and a \njoint letter from his daughter and her fianc\u00e9. (AE B \u2013 AE D) The grandson\u2019s parents said \nthey recently found out that their son had downloaded some inappropriate materials on \nApplicant\u2019s Google account. They talked to their son about \u201cwhy it wasn\u2019t ok to do that.\u201d \nThey said Applicant did not want any \u201cbacklash\u201d to happen to their son, so he took the \nblame.

(AE C) Applicant\u2019s wife offered a \u201cguarantee [that] he has not done \nwhat he is accused of.\u201d He is the protector of the family and when their adult daughters \nwere young, he refused to change them, bathe them, or be alone with them.\u201d She trusts \nhim around any child.

Applicant \npossesses integrity and has healthy boundaries. He is trustworthy, reliable, and \nconcerned for the well-being of others. He is an asset to the organization. (AE A) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has noted, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nIn April 2021, Applicant was charged in State 1 with possession of obscene \nmaterial. The exact criminal statute he was charged with violating is not clear from the \nrecord. However, in January 2023, he pled guilty to the offense charged and received a \n10-year jail term. That sentence was suspended, and he was placed on two years of \nprobation, until January 2025. Applicant was also required to register as a sex offender. \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 2.a, 3.a) \nThe doctrine of collateral estoppel generally applies in DOHA hearings and \nprecludes applicants from contending that they did not engage in criminal acts for which \nthey were convicted. ISCR Case No. 95-0817 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Feb. 21, 1997). There \nare exceptions to this general rule, especially with respect to misdemeanor convictions \nbased on guilty pleas. Relying on federal case law, the DOHA Appeal Board has \nadopted a three-part test to determine the appropriateness of applying collateral \nestoppel to criminal convictions. First, the applicant must have been afforded a full and \nfair opportunity to litigate the issue in the criminal trial. Second, the issues presented for \ncollateral estoppel must be the same as those resolved against the applicant in the \ncriminal trial.

Federal courts recognize that an individual may not have an incentive to \nfully litigate a misdemeanor offense because there is less at stake or because a plea \nbargain creates a disincentive to litigate the issues. ISCR Case No. 04-05712 (App. Bd. \nOct. 31, 2006). \nApplicant denies the SOR allegation and the cross-allegations. He also asserts, \nin various ways, that he did not download any child pornography or inappropriate \nimages of minor children. He asserts at various points that his son-in-law or his minor \ngrandson did it, and that the child admitted doing so when asked about it by his parents. \nEven so, Applicant pleaded guilty to a felony, for which he received a 10-year \nsuspended jail term. Having done so, he is barred from claiming in this forum that he did \nnot engage in the felony criminal conduct to which he pleaded guilty. \nIndeed, according to the police report, Applicant was asked about specific photos \nwith sexually explicit descriptions referencing girls aged 9, 11, and 12. According to the \npolice report, Applicant said he \u201cwould download it to see what it was and then delete \nit.\u201d (Item 4 at 3) This admission cuts against his assertions that he did not engage in the \nalleged criminal conduct. \nThe Government has met its burden in this case. Notwithstanding Applicant\u2019s \ndenials, the SOR allegations are established. Specific disqualifying conditions, as \napplicable, are discussed below. \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \nAG \u00b6 12 expresses the security concern for sexual conduct: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \nThe definition of sexual behavior under the Guideline D general concern \n\u201cincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or written \ntransmission.\u201d I find that accessing and downloading sexually explicit images of children \nsatisfies this definition. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b613(a) and 13(c) apply, as does AG \u00b6 13(d), \nsince Applicant\u2019s conduct reflects a serious lack of judgment, even though it was not \npublic. \nAG \u00b6 14 sets forth potentially applicable mitigating conditions for sexual conduct, \nincluding: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \nand \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; \nApplicant\u2019s actions put him in position where he might have been subject to \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. As he notes, however, his employer\u2019s security \ndepartment is aware of the charges, as is his family. The possibility of coercion is also \nlessened by the fact that he pleaded guilty. His arrest is also a matter of public record. \nThus, AG \u00b6 14(c) has some application. \nAG \u00b6 14(b), however, is not applicable. Applicant engaged in the conduct as \ncharged as recently as late 2020 or early 2021, pleaded guilty in January 2023, and \nremains on probation, facing a possible 10-year jail term if his probation is revoked, until \nJanuary 2025. He was also required to register as a sex offender. This means that the \nState 1 criminal authorities do not trust him to be out in society without restrictions. As \nnoted below, being on probation is itself a disqualifying condition under Guideline J. \nApplicant has not established that his conduct \u201chappened so long ago, so infrequently, \nor under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 14(b) does not \napply. Guideline D security concerns are not mitigated. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct: \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern for criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; \nand \n(c) individual is currently on probation or parole. \nApplicant was arrested and charged with felony possession of obscene matter, \nand he pleaded guilty to the charge. He was sentenced to ten years in jail, suspended \nfor two years, and was sentenced to two years of probation. He was also required to \nregister as a sex offender. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(b) and 31(c) both apply to SOR \u00b6 2.a, the criminal \nconduct cross-allegation of Guideline D \u00b6 1.a in the SOR. \nAG \u00b6 32 sets forth the potentially applicable mitigating conditions: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) do not apply for the same reasons that Guideline D AG \u00b6 \n14(a) does not apply, as discussed above. In addition, Applicant has repeatedly \nasserted that he did not engage in the felony conduct alleged, despite having pleaded \nguilty to that felony conduct in court. His continued denials undercut any evidence of \nreform and rehabilitation. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 details the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying.

AG \u00b6 16(c) is \nnot established, as it requires \u201ccredible adverse information in several adjudicative \nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline. . . .\u201d Because the conduct is fully addressed and disqualifying under other \nguidelines, as discussed above, I consider the personal conduct cross-allegation to be \nduplicative, and I find SOR \u00b6 3(a) for Applicant on that basis. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines D, J, and E in my whole-person analysis. \nSince Applicant elected a decision on the written record, in lieu of a hearing, I did \nnot have the opportunity to ask him questions about his conduct. I also had no \nopportunity to observe his demeanor during a hearing, and thus, to assess his credibility \nbeyond the documentary record. The fact that I cannot assess his credibility undercuts \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nthe strength of his denials. Further, when balanced against his guilty plea, his denials \nundercut any acceptance of responsibility and any claim of rehabilitation. \nThe simple fact in this case is that Applicant engaged in serious criminal conduct \nfor which he remains on probation and has had to register as a sex offender. It is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation, because the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3: Guideline E:   \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant access to classified information. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBraden M.

(Item 1) \nApplicant did not provide evidence indicating that he is attempting to pay or resolve \nany of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. He also did not provide proof that he filed \nhis federal and state income taxes for 2018 and 2019. His approximate monthly income \nis $7,244, His monthly expenses total $7,177. His total net remainder each month is $67. \n(Item 5 at 6) Based on his monthly budget, he is unable to resolve his delinquent \naccounts. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns. \nThe disqualifying conditions that are relevant to Applicant\u2019s case include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nAG \u00b6 19(a) and AG \u00b6 19(c) apply to Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.i. The total approximate balance of the delinquent debt is $120,120. AG \u00b6 19(f) \napplies to Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for tax \nyears 2018 and 2019 as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j \u2013 1.k. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non in the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment:  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;   \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies, in part, because Applicant\u2019s 2019 divorce was a circumstance \nbeyond his control. However, the mitigating condition is given less weight because I \ncannot conclude he acted responsibly under the circumstances because Applicant has \nmade no attempts to resolve any of the delinquent debts. \nNone of the other mitigating conditions apply because Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems are ongoing. He failed to initiate a good-faith effort to resolve his debts. He has \nnot provided documentation that he filed his 2018 and 2019 federal and state tax returns. \nApplicant bears the burden of production and persuasion in mitigation. While \nApplicant disclosed his delinquent debts on his security clearance application, he took no \naction towards resolving these delinquent accounts. He did not mitigate the concerns \nraised under Financial Considerations. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered Applicant\u2019s honorable active-\nduty service in the United States Air Force. I considered his divorce adversely affected \nhis finances. However, Applicant failed to show that he made any attempts to resolve his \ndelinquent accounts or to file his federal and state income tax returns for 2018 and 2019. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant \nhas not mitigated the security concerns raised under financial considerations. \nAccordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent \nwith the interests of national security to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(Government Exhibit 7.) \nDuring his personal interview on August 18, 2021, Applicant stated that his \nfinancial situation was good, and that he is willing to repay his debts. (Government \nExhibit 7.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and   \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred delinquent debt he could not afford to pay. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20; \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nand    \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant has been working part-time with his current employer and security \nclearance sponsor since October 2016. Since March 2017, he has also owned and \noperated a security firm and private investigation company. From the limited evidence \npresented, his debts remain delinquent and owing. Applicant\u2019s inaction for so long \nreflects a pattern of unreliability, untrustworthiness, and poor judgment. Accordingly, \nApplicant does not meet the requirements to access classified information. \nThere is nothing in the record to demonstrate that Applicant has made efforts to \nmitigate the Government\u2019s concerns under Guideline F. Without documentary evidence \nsubstantiating his assertions that he has been making payments to the creditors, that he \nis currently financially responsible, and that he is able to meet his future financial \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nobligations, Applicant has not carried his burden of proof to establish mitigation of the \nsecurity concerns alleged in the SOR. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nWhile Applicant claims that he has paid off two of his debts, he has submitted no \ndocumentary evidence to support his claims. I considered the potentially disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions in light of all relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this \ncase. I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the Financial Considerations security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.g. \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

(AE B.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.

Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \nAfter filing for bankruptcy in 2016 Applicant accrued delinquent consumer debts. \nHis admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish two disqualifying conditions \nunder this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; and AG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(d) do not fully apply. Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are \nongoing and unresolved. He discharged in bankruptcy over $73,000 in debt in 2016 and \nhas accrued over $14,000 in new debt. He was employed immediately after his retirement \nin 2017 by his sponsor. His second divorce was in 2020. He formally disputed one marital \ndebt based on fraud. In December 2022 he resolved $1,432 of the alleged debt. It is well-\nestablished that the timing of debt payments is a relevant consideration for a judge in \ndeciding whether an applicant has acted in a reasonable and responsible manner in \naddressing financial problems. To receive full credit under Mitigating Condition AG \u00b6 \n20(d), an applicant must initiate and adhere \u201cto a good faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d His recent action after receiving the FORM showing \na $100 payment on one debt and resolving two debts only after the SOR was issued is \ninsufficient for the application of this mitigating condition does not receive this mitigating \ncredit. See ISCR Case No. 08-06058 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2009). He did not establish \nthat he has made a good-faith effort to pay or resolve his debts. \nApplicant attributes his debts to his second divorce. The first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) \ntherefore applies. For full consideration under AG \u00b6 20(b), however, Applicant must \nestablish that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. He has not done so. He \ncompleted his SCA in December 2021. The most recent record evidence (May 2023 credit \nreport) shows only one alleged debt on the credit report. He addressed two debts, SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d, approximately two weeks after the SOR was issued. An applicant who \nwaits until his clearance is in jeopardy before resolving debts may be lacking in the \njudgment expected of those with access to classified information. See ISCR Case No. \n16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018) citing ISCR Case No. 15-03208 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, \n2017). The mere evidence that debts no longer appear on a credit report is not a reason \nto believe that they are not legitimate or that they have been paid. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015). He did not provide sufficient evidence that \nhe acted responsibly under the circumstances to resolve them. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not fully \napply. \nWhole-Person Concept \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. While Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies after \nhis divorce are largely attributable to circumstances beyond his control, they remain \nlargely unresolved. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nBecause Applicant requested a determination on the record without a hearing, I \nhad no opportunity to evaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR \nCase No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by \nhis delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b and 1.e-1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c and 1.d: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant a security clearance.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 52 years old. He has worked for his current contractor-employer since January 2020. He served in the U.S. Army from 1991 until 2001, when he was honorably discharged. He has worked for various government contractors since his Army discharge. He has taken some college courses. He is divorced and has one adult child. He has held a security clearance or a public trust position in the past. (Tr. 5, 18-19, 22; GE1-2) Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant deliberately gave false information on his March 2022 security clearance application (SCA) when he failed to disclose that he was fired from a job within the past seven years because of a positive urinalysis test (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b) and his illegal drug use (SOR \u00b6 1.c). It also alleged that he was terminated from his job in April 2019 because he tested positive for marijuana (SOR \u00b6 1.d). It alleged that he admitted to a background investigator that he intentionally omitted information from his SCA (SOR \u00b6 1.e). It also alleged he used marijuana and tested positive for its presence in 1995 or 1996, while possessing a security clearance (SOR \u00b6 1.f).

The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which \nwere admitted into evidence without objection. The Government\u2019s exhibit list was marked \nas hearing exhibit (HE) I. Applicant testified and offered exhibit (AE) A, which was \nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on May 1, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a-1.f; 2.a-2.b; 3.a-3.e, 3.g, and 3.i. He \ndenied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.f and 3.h. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 52 years old. He has worked for his current contractor-employer since \nJanuary 2020. He served in the U.S. Army from 1991 until 2001, when he was honorably \ndischarged. He has worked for various government contractors since his Army discharge. \nHe has taken some college courses. He is divorced and has one adult child. He has held \na security clearance or a public trust position in the past. (Tr. 5, 18-19, 22; GE1-2) \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant deliberately gave false \ninformation on his March 2022 security clearance application (SCA) when he failed to \ndisclose that he was fired from a job within the past seven years because of a positive \nurinalysis test (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b) and his illegal drug use (SOR \u00b6 1.c). It also alleged that \nhe was terminated from his job in April 2019 because he tested positive for marijuana \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d). It alleged that he admitted to a background investigator that he intentionally \nomitted information from his SCA (SOR \u00b6 1.e). It also alleged he used marijuana and \ntested positive for its presence in 1995 or 1996, while possessing a security clearance \n(SOR \u00b6 1.f). Applicant admitted all the allegations during his background interview, in his \nSOR answer, and during his testimony. (Tr. 19-22; GE 2; SOR answer) \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged in April 2019 Applicant failed a urinalysis test \nfor marijuana (SOR \u00b6 2.a); and that he was arrested in August 2003 for unlawful use and \npossession of a controlled substance marijuana (SOR \u00b6 2.b). Applicant admitted all the \nallegations during his background interview, in his SOR answer, and during his testimony. \n(Tr. 19-24; GE 2; SOR answer) \nUnder Guideline J, the SOR cross-alleged the drug allegations stated in SOR \u00b6 2 \nabove (SOR \u00b6 3.a and 3.j). It also alleged a series of criminal arrests as follows: a March \n1992 arrest in a foreign country for misuse of privileges (SOR \u00b6 3.i); a July 1992 arrest \nfor theft of government property (SOR \u00b6 3.h); an August 1993 arrest for adultery (SOR \u00b6 \n3.g); a December 1993 arrest for adultery (SOR \u00b6 3.f); a June 2000 arrest for assault \n(SOR \u00b6 3.e); a July 2000 arrest for driving while license under restraint (SOR \u00b6 3.d); an \nApril 2001 arrest for his failure to appear (SOR \u00b6 3.c); and his August 2001 arrest for \ndamaging property, criminal mischief, and making a false police report (SOR \u00b6 3.b). \nApplicant admitted all the allegations, except for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.f and 3.h, during his \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbackground interview, in his SOR answer, and during his testimony. (Tr. 19-24, 26-31, \n34-37, 40-42, 45-46; GE 2; SOR answer) \nIn 2019, Applicant was working for his employer on a government project. He held \na position of trust at the time. He knowingly ingested some edible marijuana lozenges \nwhile employed by this company. He consumed two over two days. Three weeks later, \nhe was assigned to drive a company vehicle and was involved in an accident. He was \nrequired to take a urinalysis test because of the accident. It came back with a positive \nresult for the presence of marijuana. His employer immediately terminated him from his \nposition based upon his use of marijuana. He was aware of the company\u2019s drug policy \nand knew he was not allowed to use any illegal drugs during his employment with this \ncontractor. (Tr. 21-22, 45; GE 2) \nIn March 2022, Applicant completed an SCA for his current employer. He gave \nfalse information on his SCA when he deliberately failed to disclose in Section 13A and \n13C that he was fired for cause in 2019 because of his use of marijuana as established \nby a positive urinalysis test. He also deliberately failed to disclose his 2019 marijuana use \nin Section 23 of his 2022 SCA. During his background investigation and at his hearing, \nApplicant admitted knowingly making these false statements because he was afraid that \nrevealing the truth would jeopardize his chances of receiving a security clearance. He \nadmitted his arrest for using and possessing marijuana in 2003 on a military installation. \nHe denied the marijuana was his, or that he used it on that occasion, and there is no \nrecord evidence contradicting his statement. He admitted using marijuana and testing \npositive for it in approximately 1995 or 1996 when he was in the Army. (Tr. 19, 46; GE 2) \nIn August 2001, he was angry with his ex-wife who was storing some furniture at \nhis residence. In his anger, he destroyed several pieces of furniture. He later called the \npolice and reported that someone broke into his house and destroyed the furniture. He \nwas confronted by the officers about submitting false information and admitted that he did \nso. He was charged with destruction of property and filing a false police report. He \nadmitted committing these offenses. (Tr. 30-31; GE 2, 4) \nApplicant admitted his arrest for failing to appear for a court appearance in 2001. \nHe admitted his arrest for driving while his license was under restraint in July 2000. He \nadmitted his arrest for assault in June 2000. He admitted his arrest for adultery in August \n1993. He admitted his arrest in March 1992 for misuse of privileges. There is no additional \nevidence available about these offenses. (SOR answer) \nApplicant denied an arrest for adultery and sodomy in December 1993, and an \narrest for larceny of government property in July 1992. There is no evidence in the record \nto contradict his denials. (Tr. 27, 35; GE 1-4; SOR answer) \nApplicant testified that he has not used marijuana since 2019. He has not been \narrested since 2003. He provided a written statement promising to abstain from using any \nillegal substances in the future.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nUnder AG \u00b6 16, conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national; and    \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of \nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or government \nprotected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources. \nApplicant admitted that he deliberately provided false information on his 2022 SCA. \nIn 2019, he was fired from his employment for testing positive for marijuana by his \nemployer. In 1995 or 1996, he also tested positive for marijuana when he was in the Army \nwhile holding a security clearance. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(d) apply.

Lying on his \nSCA, and using marijuana when he knew it was against company policy and was illegal \nin the Army, cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Applicant \nacknowledged his wrongdoing; however, he has a history of such behavior going back to \nhis filing of a false police report in 2001. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a), 17(c), and 17(d) do not apply. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Those that are potentially applicable in this case include: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) any substance misuse;  \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant tested positive for marijuana in 2019, which led to his firing from his \ncontractor position. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(b) apply to SOR \u00b6 2.a. Although he admitted his \narrest for possession and use of marijuana in 2003, he denied the underlying allegations \nthat he used and possessed marijuana. Since there is no record evidence to support the \n2003 allegation. I find in favor of Appellant concerning SOR \u00b6 2.b. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns, two of which \npotentially apply in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant used marijuana while working for a government contractor. He was in a \nposition of trust at the time of the incident. His claimed abstinence beginning in 2019 is \nnot sufficient to overcome his marijuana use. Although he asserts that he will not use \nmarijuana now, he has a history of use that goes back over almost 30 years to his days \nin the Army when he held a security clearance. His claimed abstinence and promise not \nto use in the future are insufficient to convince me that recurrence is unlikely. His use of \nmarijuana while holding a security clearance and holding a position of trust cast doubt \nupon his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 26(a) does not \napply. AG \u00b6 26(b) has some application. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for criminal conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \nApplicant was charged with multiple offenses including arrests in 2003, two in \n2001, two in 2000, two in 1993, and two in 1992. He also admitted to using marijuana in \n2019. I find that the above disqualifying condition applies, except to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.f and 3.g, \nwhich were not established. \nI have also considered all the mitigating conditions for criminal conduct under AG \n\u00b6 32 and considered the following relevant: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nHad Applicant not used marijuana as recently as 2019 or lied on his SCA in 2022, \nhis older criminal record might have been mitigated by the passage of time. However, it \nis clear from his recent actions that he is not rehabilitated and continues to engage in \ncriminal activity. His actions continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) do not fully apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s military service. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guidelines E, H and J. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d, 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a, 3.f, 3.h: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 3.b-3.e, 3.g, 3.i-3.j: \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Item 6 at 4) He said he was not \ninvolved with illegal drugs in the previous seven years. (Id.) \nIn Applicant\u2019s June 13, 2022 OPM PSI, the investigator confronted Applicant with \nthe allegation that he was terminated from employment with S \u201cfor attempting to falsify \nthe results of a random drug test by hiding a bag of urine within his clothing.

Applicant told the OPM investigator that \nwhen he went to provide the urine sample, the observer noticed a bulge in one of his \npockets. (Id.) Applicant said he \u201caccidentally left pill bottle in his cargo pants pocket. The \npill bottle contained two high blood pressure pills.\u201d (Id.) Applicant threw the pill bottle in \nthe trash as instructed. (Id.) He explained the positive test result was due to eating \n\u201cgummy snacks that were laced with THC.\u201d (Id. at 11) He claimed that at the time he \nconsumed the gummy snacks he was unaware of the presence of the THC. (Id.) He \npromised not to use marijuana in the future. (Id.) He said he does not associate with \nmarijuana users. (Id.) \nApplicant concluded his SOR response with the following statement: \nI take full responsibility for my actions of not holding myself accountable and \nbeing upfront with the truth during the security questions. I have been \nashamed of myself because I knew better and chose not to and for that I \nfully understand why I was rejected. I can promise you and myself that this \nwill never happen again and that I have taken the necessary measures to \nensure that it doesn\u2019t. It is very important to me that you all trust me to do \nwhat I am suppose[d] to do as well as honoring my commitments. \nI let myself down, and more importantly I let my wife down, and I let my \ncompany down and I regret the whole incident. I am deeply embarrassed to \nhave put myself as well as the agents through something that could have \nbeen avoided by being truthful, but I was not thinking clearly at the time, \nand I have taken full responsibility for my actions. I would be honored to be \nable to get my security clearance, but I also understand I do not get to make \nthat decision based [on] my decisions. (Item 4 at 3) \nIn the FORM, Department Counsel described Applicant\u2019s security-significant \nbehavior and noted the absence of persuasive mitigation.

(FORM at 9 (emphasis added)) \nApplicant did not provide any response to the FORM. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.

May 2, 1996). \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above definition)\u201d; \u201c(b) testing \npositive for an illegal drug\u201d; and \u201c(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance. . . .\u201d The \nrecord establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(b), and 25(c). Additional discussion is in the mitigation \nsection, infra. \nAG \u00b6 26 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b).   \nApplicant knowingly used marijuana in November 2020, and his marijuana use was \ndetected when his employer administered a urinalysis test. He possessed marijuana \nbefore he used it. I do not believe Applicant\u2019s claim in his OPM interview that his marijuana \nuse was unknowing or a case of innocent ingestion. \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act, are \ncontained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c). Possession of controlled substances without a lawful \nprescription is a federal criminal offense. For marijuana, a lawful prescription is not \nauthorized under federal law. Marijuana is listed on Schedule I. See Drug Enforcement \nAdministration listing of controlled substances on Schedules I through IV at \nhttps://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/orangebook/c cs alpha.pdf. \nThe Security Executive Agent (SecEA) promulgated clarifying guidance \nconcerning marijuana-related issues in security clearance adjudications as follows: \n[Federal] agencies are instructed that prior recreational marijuana use by \nan individual may be relevant to adjudications but not determinative. The \nSecEA has provided direction in [the adjudicative guidelines] to agencies \nthat requires them to use a \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d This requires \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nadjudicators to carefully weigh a number of variables in an individual\u2019s life \nto determine whether that individual's behavior raises a security concern, if \nat all, and whether that concern has been mitigated such that the individual \nmay now receive a favorable adjudicative determination. Relevant \nmitigations include, but are not limited to, frequency of use and whether the \nindividual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur, including by \nsigning an attestation or other such appropriate mitigation. Additionally, in \nlight of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting illegal drug use \nwhile occupying a sensitive position or holding a security .clearance, \nagencies are encouraged to advise prospective national security workforce \nemployees that they should refrain from any future marijuana use upon \ninitiation of the national security vetting process, which commences once \nthe individual signs the certification contained in the Standard Form 86 (SF-\n86), Questionnaire for National Security Positions. \nSecurity Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies \nConducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (Dec. 21, 2021) at 2 (quoted in ISCR \nCase No. 20-02974 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2022)). \nApplicant said he used marijuana once in November 2020, and that marijuana use \nwas detected in a urinalysis test. He said he does not intend to use marijuana in the future. \nHowever, Applicant attempted to adulterate his urine sample during the collection of his \nurine sample for urinalysis testing to keep his employer from discovering his marijuana \nuse. He was not honest and candid on his SCA about his marijuana use. \nThe SOR does not allege that Applicant failed to provide accurate information \nduring his May 10, 2022 OPM PSI, when he confirmed information in his SCA that he was \nlaid off from his employment with S due to COVID. He also told the OPM investigator that \nhe was not involved with illegal drugs in the previous seven years. In ISCR Case No. 03-\n20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which \nconduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.  \nId.

Guideline H security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 describes the security concern about personal conduct as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \nAG \u00b6 16 includes one disqualifying condition that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nAG \u00b6 16(a) applies and will be addressed in the mitigating section, infra. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns as follows: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nThe Appeal Board has explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, \nstating: \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has \nthe burden of proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, \ndoes not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the\nomission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record evidence as \na whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence \nconcerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission\noccurred.

Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 \n(App. Bd. June 9, 2004)). In about November 2020 Applicant was terminated from his \nemployment with S for failing a random drug test by testing positive for marijuana and for \nattempting to falsify the results of a drug test. \nOn April 7, 2022, Applicant responded to the question on his SCA about why he \nleft employment that he held from August 2014 to November 2020 and stated he was laid \noff because of COVID. He deliberately failed to disclose the actual information about why \nhe was terminated from employment with S. On April 7, 2022, Applicant responded to the \nquestion on his SCA about illegal use of drugs and controlled substances in the previous \nseven years, and he stated, \u201cNo.\u201d He deliberately failed to disclose his marijuana use in \nNovember 2020. \nApplicant failed to honestly and candidly disclose negative information on his April \n7, 2022 SCA.

Personal conduct security concerns are not \nmitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines H and \nE are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 45-year-old senior analyst who is seeking employment with a DOD \ncontractor. In 2014, he was awarded an associate degree, and in 2017, he was awarded \na bachelor\u2019s degree. He did not disclose any arrests, abuse of alcohol, or security \nviolations on his SCA, and there is no evidence to the contrary. \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is more persuasive at this time. \nIn November 2020, Applicant unsuccessfully attempted to adulterate his urine sample, \nwhich subsequently tested positive for the presence of the THC metabolite. He lied on his \nApril 7, 2022 SCA and during his initial OPM PSI about why he was terminated from \nemployment with company S and about using marijuana in November 2020. I find that he \ndeliberately provided false information on his SCA and during his initial OPM PSI. \nAn honest and candid self-report of security-relevant personal information is an \nimportant indication that, if granted security clearance eligibility, the individual would \ndisclose any threats to national security, even if the disclosure involves an issue that \nmight damage his or her own career or personal reputation. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd.

The Government\u2019s documents \nidentified as Items 1 through 5 are admitted in evidence without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted both SOR allegations. He is 22 years old, \nunmarried, and he does not have any children. He graduated from high school in 2018, \nand he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2022. He has worked as an associate for his \nemployer, a DOD contractor, since June 2022. He has never held a security clearance. \n(Items 1-5) \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency from approximately October \n2017 to January 2022. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) He used it recreationally, and he estimated that he \nused it approximately 75 times. He obtained it from and used it with friends. (Items 1-5) \nApplicant also used nitrous oxide, with varying frequency from approximately \nFebruary 2020 to July 2021. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) He used the inhalant, also known as \n\u201cwhippets,\u201d recreationally approximately four to five times over the course of several \nmonths. He used it with his stepbrother, who purchased it. It made him feel semi-\neuphoric. (Items 1-5) \nApplicant stated in his SCA and indicated during his background interview that he \nmay use marijuana again if it becomes legal under federal law. He stated in his May \n2022 security clearance application (SCA), \u201cI do not find myself in a situation where I \nwould want to use this drug [nitrous oxide] in the future.\u201d He indicated during his \nbackground interview that he did not currently use illegal drugs or misuse prescription \ndrugs, but that he might use drugs again if they became legal. He indicated that he did \nnot socialize with individuals who use drugs illegally. (Items 4-5) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and \nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant \nor proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion \nto obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse as: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \u201c(a) any substance misuse . . . ,\u201d and \n\u201c(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.\u201d \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency between 2017 and 2022. He \nalso used nitrous oxide with varying frequency between 2020 and 2021. He stated in his \nSCA and indicated during his background interview that he would likely use marijuana \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand drugs again in the future if they became legal. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) are \nestablished. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides the following potentially relevant mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nApplicant indicated during his background interview that he no longer associated \nwith the individuals with whom he previously used drugs illegally. AG \u00b6 26(b)(1) is \nestablished. However, he did not provide a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse. He also kept open the possibility of using \ndrugs again in the future if they were legal. Further, Applicant last used nitrous oxide \nless than two years ago, and last used marijuana as recently as January 2022. His use \nis recent enough that I cannot find that it is unlikely to recur. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), \n26(b)(2), and 26(b)(3) are not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in this whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the drug involvement security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and \nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant \nor proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion \nto obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse as: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \u201c(a) any substance misuse . . . ;\u201d \u201c(c) \nillegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia;\u201d and \n\u201c(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, or failure to \nclearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse.\u201d \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency between 2014 and 2022. He \nused hallucinogens with varying frequency between 2014 and 2021. He also used \nstimulants, not prescribed to him, with varying frequency between 2017 and 2020. He \nstated in his SCA, during his background interview, and in his Answer that he intends to \ncontinue using marijuana and hallucinogens. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(g) are \nestablished. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides the following potentially relevant mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility; and \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant last used hallucinogens less than two years ago, and he last used \nmarijuana as recently as October 2022. His use is recent enough that I cannot find that \nit is unlikely to recur. He indicated during his background interview that he continues to \nassociate with individuals who use drugs. He did not provide a signed statement of \nintent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, and he intends to \ncontinue to use marijuana and hallucinogens. He used stimulants that were not \nprescribed to him. I find that none of the above mitigating conditions are established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in this whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the drug involvement security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

Applicant received \na bankruptcy discharge of her 2012 Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in August 2017. \n(Item 8) \nIn March 2020, Applicant petitioned again for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief. (Item \n9) In this petition, she claimed exempt property of $15,500 and scheduled secured \nclaims of $40,385. (Item 9) She scheduled unsecured non-priority claims of $22,083. \n(Item 9) Her scheduled monthly payments to the Chapter 13 trustee are $350 and are \nscheduled to continue for 60 months. (Item 9) \nIn her 2020 Chapter 13 petition, Applicant calculated her gross monthly income \nin 2020 to be $4,338, and her monthly expenses to be $2,945, which left her with a \nmonthly remainder of $350. (Item 9) For calendar year 2019, she reported her gross \nannual income to be $44,292. (Item 9) Whether or not she has been able to keep up \nwith her monthly payments cannot be determined without more financial information \nfrom Applicant. \nBetween 2006 and 2020, Applicant had four cars repossessed for failure to meet \nher scheduled monthly car payments, (Items 2-7) All but two of the deficiency balances \nassociated with the repossessions were included in her Chapter 13 bankruptcy \npetitions. (Items 8-9) Besides her vehicle repossessions, Applicant accrued a delinquent \nmedical account in the amount of $94 that remains unresolved and outstanding.

These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence.

See Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.1.14; \nMcCormick on Evidence \u00a7 262 (6th ed. 2006). Her admitted delinquent debt accruals are \nfully documented and create judgment issues as well over the management of her \nfinances. See ISCR Case No. 03-01059 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004). \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing delinquent accounts is critical to an \nassessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in following \nrules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified information or to \nholding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23. \n2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015); ISCR Case No. 14\u00ad\n00221 at 2-5 (App. Bd.

In the past, the Appeal \nBoard has consistently imposed evidentiary burdens on applicants to provide \ndocumentation corroborating actions taken to resolve financial problems, whether the \nissues relate to tax, consumer, medical, or other debts and accounts. See ISCR Case \nNo. 19-02593 at 4-5 (App. Bd.

While Applicant is entitled to credit \nfor her contributions to the defense industry, her efforts are not enough at this time to \novercome her repeated failures or inability to address her debts and accounts (inclusive \nof her small medical debt covered by SOR i\u00b6 1.c) in a timely and rprudent way over the \ncourse of many years. Overall trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment have not \nbeen established. \nBased on a consideration of all of the facts and circumstances considered in this \ncase, it is too soon to make safe predictions that Applicant will be able to undertake \nreasoned and timely good-faith efforts to mitigate the Government\u2019s financial concerns \n6 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n  \n \n \n                              \n \n \n                         \n                                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nwithin the foreseeable future.

She avers that these debts were \u201ccharged off,\u201d and submits tax \ndocuments showing that Applicant has paid taxes on the amount charged off. \n(Response.) However, this does not show a good-faith effort to satisfy her past-due debts. \nThese allegations are found against Applicant. \n1.c. and 1.d. Applicant admits that she has past-due debts to Creditor C totaling \nabout $15,950. Applicant offers nothing further in this regard. These allegations are found \nagainst Applicant. \n1.e. Applicant admits that she has a past-due debt to Creditor E in the amount of \nabout $2,261, and offers nothing further in this regard. This allegation is found against \nApplicant. \n1.f. Applicant admits that she has a past-due debt to Creditor F in the amount of \nabout $1,966, and offers nothing further in this regard. This allegation is found against \nApplicant. \n1.g. Applicant admits that she has a past-due debt to Creditor G in the amount of \nabout $1,812, and offers nothing further in this regard. This allegation is found against \nApplicant. \n1.h.

This allegation is found against \nApplicant. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of\nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider\nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order \nadverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by her credit reports, establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nNone of these are applicable. Apart from the charged-off debts of 1.a., 1.b. and \n1.j., which Applicant has only partially addressed by paying taxes on the charged-off \namounts, she has failed to address the remaining $23,263 of admitted past-due debts, \n1.c.~1.i. Applicant failed to meet her burden to mitigate the financial concerns set out in \nthe SOR. For these reasons, I find Financial Considerations against Applicant. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised \nby her financial indebtedness. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried her burden of \nshowing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.~1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \nRichard A.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on October 25, 2021. \nOn January 20, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudication Services (CAS) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guideline F. The CAS acted under Executive Order (Exec.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish two disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating conditions are \npotentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation,\nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n \n \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling\nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit\ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nNone of the above mitigating conditions are established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent \ndebts are numerous, recent, and there is no evidence that they were incurred under \ncircumstances making recurrence unlikely. The injury of Applicant\u2019s wife in an accident \nand the resulting loss of employment were conditions largely beyond his control, but he \nsubmitted no evidence of responsible behavior regarding the debts. He submitted no \nevidence of financial counseling, no evidence reflecting \u201cclear indications\u201d that his \nfinancial problems are under control, and no evidence of good-faith efforts to resolve his \ndelinquent debts. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \n5 \n\nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.s: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

On December 12, 2022, the \nDefense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF), now renamed the DCSA Consolidated Adjudications Services (DOD \nCAS) formerly known as the Department of Defense (DOD) CAF, issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to him under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; \nDoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the \nSecurity Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(December 10, 2016) (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand detailed reasons why the DOD CAS adjudicators were unable to find that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant.

A complete copy of the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on April 28, 2023, and he was afforded an \nopportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of \nthe Directive as well as the Adjudication Guidelines applicable to his case. Applicant \nreceived the FORM on May 5, 2023. His response was due on June 4, 2023. Applicant \nchose not to respond to the FORM, for as of June 21, 2023, no response had been \nreceived. The case was assigned to me on August 1, 2023, and there was still no \nresponse to the FORM. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, without comments, all the SOR \nallegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.f.). \nBackground \nApplicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor.

Since his move, he has made no effort to contact the creditor. \n(Item 4 at 2) The account has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. refers to a cellphone account with a delinquent balance of \napproximately $1,254 that was placed for collection in 2016. (Item 3 at 45-46; Item 4 at \n2; Item 6 at 2; Item 7 at 4) The account has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. refers to a storage unit account with a delinquent balance of \napproximately $245 that was placed for collection in 2016. Applicant contended that he \nfirst became aware of the delinquency in late 2016 or early 2017 when he received a \nletter informing him that the unit contents had been seized for non-payment. (Item 3 at \n44-45; Item 4 at 2; Item 6 at 2; Item 7 at 5) The account has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. refers to a bank-issued credit-card account with a delinquent balance \nof approximately $443 that was placed for collection in 2017. As of January 2022, \nApplicant was still receiving monthly collection letters from the collection agency. (Item 3 \nat 42-43; Item 4 at 2; Item 6 at 2; Item 7 at 5) The account has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e. refers to a telephone account with a delinquent balance of \napproximately $941 that was placed for collection in 2015. (Item 3 at 41-42; Item 4 at 2; \nItem 7 at 5) The account has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f. refers to an automobile loan account with a delinquent balance of \napproximately $15,334 after the vehicle was involuntarily repossessed in 2015 or 2016. \nApplicant failed to make any vehicle payments for about four months before waking up \none day to find that the vehicle was gone. While he did contact the creditor to retrieve \nhis possessions from the vehicle, he has made no efforts to arrange any form of \npayment. (Item 4 at 3; Item 6 at 3; Item 7 at 6) The account has not been resolved. \nApplicant explained that his ex-wife handled all financial matters and that he \nknew he had limited funds but was otherwise unaware of his financial status. However, \nmost of the accounts became delinquent before he was married. He noted that some of \nthe accounts became delinquent during periods when work was slow and he did not \nhave sufficient funds to address them. In May 2021, he wrote that he was \u201cjust getting \nthrough [his] financial struggle.\u201d (Item 3 at 42-44) He repeatedly stated that he has no \nintention of paying any of the aforementioned accounts.

(Item 4 at 4) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the \nrecord.\u201d  (ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.32.1)). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a \npreponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  \nCir. 1994).) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive and has the burden of establishing \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as \nwell. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to \nrepose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants \naccess to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nFurthermore, \u201csecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of \ndenials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have \nbased this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to \nApplicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has \nor has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those \nconclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the \nrecord. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nknown sources of income is also a security concern insofar as it may result \nfrom criminal activity, including espionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe SOR alleged six delinquent debts totaling approximately 22,637. Applicant \nacknowledged all of those accounts and did not dispute them; admitted that he had \ntaken no positive resolution actions regarding the accounts; and repeatedly stated that \nhe has no intention of paying any of those creditors. Instead, he said he was simply \nwaiting for the collections to be removed from his credit report due to their respective \nages. Based on those facts, as well as his comments regarding past financial struggles \nand current ability to pay those accounts, it is clear that AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c) \nhave been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant noted that there had been \nperiods when work was slow and funds were limited, but he also acknowledged that, at \nleast since May 2021, he has funds sufficient to pay his debts. His newer accounts are \nreportedly current. However, he has repeatedly refused to indicate any good-faith effort \nto resolve his delinquent accounts \u2013 none of which he disputed \u2013 and is simply waiting \nfor them to be removed from his credit report. There is no evidence of financial \ncounseling. \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent \nbecause \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct \nand, therefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating \nconditions.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \nBased on the evidence, it appears that Applicant has continued to ignore his \ndelinquent accounts for a substantial multi-year period. The overwhelming evidence \nleads to the conclusion that his financial problems are not under control or that he is not \ntruly interested in resolving them. His inaction indicates that he has not acted \nresponsibly. The Appeal Board has previously commented on such a situation: \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due \nto circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider \nwhether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing \nwith those financial difficulties. ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. \nJan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); \nISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his or her financial problems only after being \nplaced on notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the \njudgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is \nno immediate threat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at \n5 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018)) \nIn this instance, Applicant has clearly stated an intention to ignore his delinquent \naccounts and he is simply waiting for them to be removed from his credit report because \nof their age. His actions \u2013 or inaction in this regard \u2013 have complied with his stated \nintentions. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. \nAn applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant \nimmediately resolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, \nnor is there a requirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. \n7 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nRather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of \nsuch debts, or resolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in \nthe future, without further confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, Applicant \noffered specific statements regarding his refusal to address his delinquent accounts. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires a \nshowing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \nThere is clear evidence that while Applicant has a small monthly remainder \navailable for savings or spending, he has refused make any payments to the creditors of \nhis delinquent accounts. Applicant\u2019s position, under the circumstances, casts doubt on \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. See ISCR Case No. 09-\n08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, \n2006). \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial considerations. \nApplicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a \nproduction planning associate since March 2018. He was previously employed by other \nemployers in a variety of short-term (generally less than 12 months each) positions as \nan interior installer (October 2012 \u2013 March 2018). He was unemployed during brief \nperiods in 2012, 2014, and 2017. He is a 2011 high school graduate. He was granted a \nsecret clearance in 2011 and 2019. . \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. There are six delinquent debts totaling approximately \n22,637, including an involuntarily repossessed automobile. Those debts essentially \nbecame delinquent during the period 2014 \u2013 2017. Applicant acknowledged all of those \naccounts and did not dispute them; admitted that he had taken no positive resolution \nactions regarding the accounts; and repeatedly stated that he has no intention of paying \nany of those creditors. Instead, he was simply waiting for the collections to be removed \nfrom his credit report due to their respective ages. As of the date of this decision, he has \nfurnished no evidence to indicate any change in his position. Applicant\u2019s actions or \ninaction generate lingering questions if he is currently in a better position financially than \nhe had been, as well as continuing doubt about his current reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a plan \nprovide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a \nreasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of \nsuch debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nApplicant\u2019s track record of continued refusal to resolve his financial issues is \nnegative and disappointing. Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions \nand doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising \nfrom his financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) (1) through AG 2(d) (9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.f.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n10 \n",

He provided no character evidence for consideration under the whole-person \nconcept. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.

See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd.

Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are established for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.b. \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n     \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of \nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or government \nprotected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct in his workplace prior to having a security clearance reflects \nquestionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. It also \ncreated vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6 16(d) is therefore \napplicable. The general concerns about questionable judgment and an unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations contained in the general personal conduct security \nconcern of AG \u00b6 15 is established. \nIn order to mitigate SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, Applicant has the burden of establishing \none or more of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) may have \nsome applicability. They provide: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.a, Applicant acknowledges his use. He continued to use marijuana \nafter taking a position involving drug testing. He continued the behavior of using marijuana \nafter testing positive and after completing a drug treatment program. AG \u00b6 17(c) is not \napplicable. \nThe relevant issue under AG \u00b6 17(d) is whether Applicant\u2019s statement that he \nwould stop using marijuana to retain his job is supported by his actions. Applicant failed \na drug test after being placed in a treatment program. I conclude that the behavior is likely \nto recur. AG \u00b6 17(d) is not applicable. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment.

Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the record establish the following disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline, as detailed in AG \u00b6 25: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or    \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant admitted using marijuana from about June 2006 until May 2022. (SOR \u00b6 \n2.a). AG \u00b6 25(a) applies. \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges not only because Applicant used marijuana from July 2017 until \nMay 2022, but also because he did so while granted access to classified information. The \nportion of this allegation concerning marijuana possession (without regard to classified \naccess) is established but is also covered in SOR \u00b6 2.a. \nApplicant\u2019s answer did not address the status of his access to classified \ninformation at the time. He simply stated in his interrogatories that he held a clearance. \nFurther, eligibility for access to classified information and the granting of access to \nclassified information are not synonymous concepts. They are separate determinations. \nThe issuance of a security clearance is a determination that an individual is eligible for \naccess to classified national security information up to a certain level. Security clearance \neligibility alone does not grant an individual access to classified materials. In order to gain \naccess to specific classified materials, an individual must not only have eligibility (i.e., a \nsecurity clearance), but also must have signed a nondisclosure agreement and have a \n\u201cneed to know.\u201d See Executive Order 13526, dated December 29, 2009, at \u00a7 4.1.

AG \u00b6 25(f) does not \napply, and SOR \u00b6 2.b is concluded for Applicant. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable as detailed in AG \u00b6 \n26 to SOR \u00b6 2.a: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use from about June 2006 \nuntil May 2022 is recent. His actions cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is not established. Applicant admitted to using marijuana. His actions \nafter losing a job in 2015 for drug use and after being arrested for possession of marijuana \nare inconsistent with his statements that he intends to avoid future involvement with \nmarijuana to retain his position. The security concern regarding his drug involvement is \nnot mitigated. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern for criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n \nThe following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable as detailed in AG \u00b6 \n31: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nState law enforcement executed a consent search of Applicant\u2019s vehicle and \narrested him for possession of marijuana. The above disqualifying condition applies. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable as detailed in AG \u00b6 \n32: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to, \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6 32(a), (c), and (d) do not apply. Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct is serious. His \ncriminal conduct is unresolved and continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, good judgment, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. The above mitigating conditions, individually or collectively, are insufficient to \nalleviate those concerns given his history of using marijuana. He needs to establish the \ncharge has been resolved and a longer record of accomplishment of responsible behavior \nand compliance with rules, regulations, and the law before his criminal conduct can be \nconsidered mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                       \n \n \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines E, H, and J in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all allegations except the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.c. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 35-year-old systems technician employed by a defense contractor since October 2021. He served honorably in the active-duty U.S. Navy from 2010 until June 2021 when he was medically retired. Prior to discharge, he worked and lived in another state (S1) before being assigned to a position in the current state (S2), in about November 2018. Applicant was unemployed for about three months before acquiring his current position in October 2021. (Items 3 and 4) Applicant is a May 2006 high school graduate. In September 2021, he enrolled in a college program and continues to attend classes part-time towards his degree completion. He married in August 2016. He is father to three children ages 12, 6, and 4; and two stepchildren, ages 16 and 11. Four of the five children live with him and his wife in the family home. In August 2022, S2\u2019s child support services department sent a Wage Garnishment Order, or Income Withholding for Support (IWO) order to his employer for direct withdrawal of his wages for child support. He had previously informed his employer that the IWO order was forthcoming, explaining that his current resident state, S2, required him to pay child support pursuant to the IWO order, whereas his previous resident state, S1, did not have this requirement.

On \nDecember 1, 2022, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudication \nServices (CAS) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline F (financial considerations). The CAS acted under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on January 17, 2023, and elected to have his \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.

He received the FORM on February \n6, 2023, and did not respond. The case was assigned to me on May 15, 2023. Items 1 \nthrough 8 are admitted in evidence without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all allegations except the allegation \nin SOR \u00b6 1.c. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 35-year-old systems technician employed by a defense contractor \nsince October 2021. He served honorably in the active-duty U.S. Navy from 2010 until \nJune 2021 when he was medically retired. Prior to discharge, he worked and lived in \nanother state (S1) before being assigned to a position in the current state (S2), in about \nNovember 2018. Applicant was unemployed for about three months before acquiring his \ncurrent position in October 2021. (Items 3 and 4) \nApplicant is a May 2006 high school graduate. In September 2021, he enrolled in \na college program and continues to attend classes part-time towards his degree \ncompletion. He married in August 2016. He is father to three children ages 12, 6, and 4; \nand two stepchildren, ages 16 and 11. Four of the five children live with him and his wife \nin the family home. In August 2022, S2\u2019s child support services department sent a Wage \nGarnishment Order, or Income Withholding for Support (IWO) order to his employer for \ndirect withdrawal of his wages for child support. He had previously informed his employer \nthat the IWO order was forthcoming, explaining that his current resident state, S2, \nrequired him to pay child support pursuant to the IWO order, whereas his previous \nresident state, S1, did not have this requirement. (Items 4 and 8) \nThe SOR alleges eight financial issues, including seven delinquent debts totaling \nabout $28,700; and the IWO order discussed above. (Item 1) In his response, Applicant \nadmitted all allegations except SOR \u00b6 1.c. (Item 2) He attributed his financial problems to \nhis move in November 2018 to S2, a high cost of living state. He disclosed during his \ninterview that he was not financially savvy or [financially] smart and admitted to making \nfinancial mistakes, but stated he was addressing the problem. (Item 4 at 4). He hired a \ncredit repair company to help \u201cclean up\u201d his credit, confirmed by the company in a letter \ndated May 2, 2022 (Item 2 at 3) It reads: \nPlease be advised that [Applicant] has enrolled in our credit restoration \nservice to assist with the removal of any erroneous, inaccurate and obsolete \nderogatory credit information that has been reported to the three credit \nbureaus. Our restoration program also provides extensive credit education. \n(Item 2 at 3) He stated the company was assisting him with the removal of any erroneous, \ninaccurate, or obsolete derogatory credit information [from his credit reports]; and credit \neducation; but acknowledged the company was not a credit counseling service.

(Item 2 at 3; Item 3 at 34; and Item 4 at 2 and 6) At the close of the \ninterview, he told investigators he would provide documentation and more details on the \naccounts; and that he was living within his means and paying off debts and would have \nno future financial issues. (Item 4 at 4) He failed to provide any documentary proof \nshowing the terms of the contract including the effective date and obligations of the \nparties. \nIn May 2022, Applicant earned a monthly salary of about $6,284 ($75,000 \nannually). He also received monthly Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) non-taxable \ndisability pay of about $2,871 ($34,400 annually). His additional financial assets included \na savings account of about $11,300; a checking account of about $5,400; and a company \n401(k) account of about $25,000. Applicant\u2019s monthly discretionary income, after all bills \nand expenses were paid, totaled over $4,000. (Item 4 at pp. 5 through 6) \nThe evidence concerning the financial issues alleged in the SOR is summarized \nbelow. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: account charged off for $8,685. Applicant admits this debt. He \ndisclosed that he borrowed this money to catch up on bills before his discharge from the \nNavy. He states he was paying $325 monthly; and that he missed a few payments, but \nultimately \u201ccaught up\u201d in May 2022. (Item 4 at 3). He later stated in his SOR response \nthat he made payments until he lost his job due [to his] clearance. He stated he \u201c[has] \nbeen in touch with [the creditor] and making strides to get [his] account back to positive.\u201d \n(Item 2 at 1). No further information was disclosed in his SOR response concerning any \nloss of employment referenced here. This debt, opened in March 2021, appears in all \nthree credit bureau reports. In January 2022, it was 60 days past due with a balance of \n$7,758. (Item 7 at 6). The past-due balance became $8685 in about June 2022; and the \naccount was ultimately charged off to profit and loss. (Item 6 at 2 and Item 5 at 4) This \ndebt is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: account in collection for $4,653. Applicant admits this debt. He \ndisclosed that in about October 2020 he changed phone providers; and that, though he \npaid his bill in full and returned the leased devices, the company charged him for early \ntermination of services. (Item 4 at 3) He states he contacted the company and was waiting \nto hear back. (Item 3 at 39; and Item 4 at 3) His comments in his SOR response are \ninconsistent with previous factual comments about this debt. (See Item 2 at 1) This debt \nwas assigned in about January 2022 and remained in a collection status after he or his \ncredit repair company disputed it. (Item 6 at 2, and Item 7 at 3). This debt is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: account in collection for $192. Applicant denies this debt, stating he \nhas never associated with the company. This debt is identified as an individual account \nthat was placed for collection in July 2022. (Item 6 at 2) It does not appear in Item 5, the \nmost recent credit bureau report. This debt is resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: account charged off for $13,049. Applicant admits this debt. He \ndisclosed this was a voluntary repossession of a car he previously owned.

This debt is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: account past-due balance of $200 with a total balance of $475. \nApplicant admits this debt, and stated he is in contact with the creditor. He offers no \nadditional comments or documents on the current status of this debt. (Item 2 at 1) His last \npayment on the debt was in December 2021. It was ultimately charged off in about August \n2022. (Item 5 at 9) This debt is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: account in collection for $1,304. Applicant admits this debt. He \ndisclosed this debt was caused by a gap in insurance coverage after a car accident where \nhis car was a total loss. He agreed to pay $110 per month until resolved but he failed to \npay the debt. (Item 4 at 36) The record shows Applicant disputed the debt in about \nDecember 2021; but he offers no explanation, information, or documented proof \nindicating the reason or basis for the dispute. (Item 7 at 3) The debt does not appear in \nthe two later credit bureau reports. (Items 5 and 6) This debt is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: account in collection for $650. Applicant admits this debt. He \ndisclosed that he purchased a service for his parents and that they paid the account for \na few years but stopped paying the bill and failed to return the equipment. He stated he \nis in contact with the creditor but also working with his credit repair company to \u201cclear his \ncredit.\u201d (Item 2 at 1). The record shows he or his credit repair representative disputed the \ndebt but he offers no explanation, information, or documented proof indicating the reason \nor basis for the dispute. (Item 7 at 4) The debt does not appear in the two later credit \nbureau reports. (Items 5 and 6) This debt is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: wage garnishment for child support and child support arrears. \nApplicant admits this debt with explanation. He disclosed that he reported this \ngarnishment order for child support to his employer, explaining his previous state, S1, did \nnot require child support payments via direct garnishment or IWO orders, unlike S2. \n(Items 4 and 8) This statement is supported in Item 8. The issue is resolved. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d EO 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d EO 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988); see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems including multiple delinquent debts. \nHe initially experienced some financial hardship after moving to S2, a high cost of living \nstate in 2018; and during his brief unemployed period in 2021. In May 2022, he reported \nmonthly discretionary income exceeding $4,000, in addition to healthy savings, checking, \nand 401(k) account balances. He had the available means to pay delinquent debts, but \nfailed to do so. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), and 19(c) are applicable. \nApplicant denied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c, stating he never associated with the \ncompany. The debt initially appeared as an individual account placed for collection in July \n2022; however, it did not appear in the later credit bureau report. This debt is resolved in \nApplicant\u2019s favor.  \nApplicant admitted the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h, with explanation. He reported the \ngarnishment order for child support to his employer, explaining his previous state did not \nrequire child support payments by direct garnishment or IWO orders, unlike the current \nstate, a statement supported by the evidence.

Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous and \nongoing; his longstanding delinquent debts in the SOR remain largely unresolved. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant could have experienced financial \nstrain after moving to S2, a high cost of living state in 2018; and briefly during his three-\nmonth unemployment period, July through September 2021, prior to acquiring his current \nposition. However, he has not established he acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant admitted he was not financially savvy and that he made financial \nmistakes. Though he hired a credit repair company to help with financial issues, the \ncompany\u2019s primary purpose was to assist with the removal of \u201cerroneous, inaccurate, or \nobsolete derogatory credit information\u201d from reports of the three major credit bureau \nreporting services. There is no indication he took steps to substantively address his \ndelinquent debts. The fact a debt no longer appears on a credit report does not establish \nany meaningful independent evidence concerning the disposition of the debt. See ISCR \nCase No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd.

Though a few delinquent debts alleged in the SOR \nwere disputed, Applicant did not elaborate on this aspect, nor did he present independent \nevidence supporting a reasonable basis to dispute any such delinquent debts. \nIn sum, there is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. \nHis financial issues continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. I find that financial considerations security concerns remain despite the \npresence of some mitigation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d through 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

The case was assigned to me on June 1, 2023. The \nGovernment\u2019s documents, identified as Items 1 through 4, and AE A, are admitted in \nevidence without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations in his Answer. He is 25 years old. As \nof his May 2022 security clearance application (SCA), he was not married, and he did \nnot have any children. He graduated from high school in 2016 and earned a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in December 2021. He worked part time as a self-employed freelance web \ndeveloper from December 2020 to December 2021.

He has never held a security clearance. (Items 1-4) \nApplicant used and purchased marijuana with varying frequency from \napproximately May 2015 to March 2022. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 2.a) He first used marijuana \nout of curiosity during his junior year of high school in state A. He continued to use it \nsocially with friends, at his or a friend\u2019s residence, between five times daily and five \ntimes weekly. He also ate edible marijuana brownies once every three to six months. He \nalso purchased it for his personal use. After it was legalized in state A in approximately \nlate 2018, he purchased it from licensed marijuana dispensaries in state A. He also \npurchased it from such dispensaries when he visited state B. (Items 1-4) \nIn March 2022, Applicant stopped using marijuana. He wanted to focus on his job \nsearch and reduce his feelings of anxiety and lack of motivation that he associated with \nhis marijuana use. He stated in his SCA that he saw the negatives of continued \nmarijuana use once he was no longer in college or around the people with whom he \nused marijuana, and he had also become comfortable with the idea of using marijuana \nupon its legalization in state A. He realized it would have been beneficial for him to stop \nusing marijuana earlier. In his FORM Response, he stated that he highly values \nprogressing in his chosen profession, which is in contradiction with using drugs, and he \nreiterated his intention to abstain from marijuana use. He underwent pre-employment \ndrug screening by his employer in May 2022, and he has never been informed that he \ntested positive for drugs in a drug test. (Items 1-4; AE A) \nApplicant continues to associate with two friends with whom he previously used \nand purchased marijuana, and one of these friends has been his roommate since \nOctober 2022. Both friends continue to use marijuana. Although he requested that both \nfriends not use marijuana in his presence, he was aware, in November 2022 when he \nresponded to DOHA interrogatories, that his roommate used and stored marijuana-\nrelated paraphernalia somewhere in their residence and he had been around his \nroommate two to four times monthly while his roommate was under the influence of \nmarijuana.

He stated \nthat his other friend follows these conditions when he visits Applicant. He stated that \nboth friends respect his decision to focus on progressing in his career and abstaining \nfrom marijuana. His parents and sibling are aware of his marijuana involvement. (Items \n1-4) \nApplicant also used and purchased hallucinogens, including lysergic acid \ndiethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin mushrooms, with varying frequency and on various \noccasions, from approximately December 2015 to September 2016. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, \n2.a) He was introduced to hallucinogens in high school by friends with whom he no \nlonger associates. He used LSD approximately three times and psilocybin mushrooms \nonce, out of curiosity and social pressure. He contributed money so that his friends \ncould purchase these hallucinogens from dealers. He found that the hallucinogens \nmade him anxious, which he did not enjoy, so he decided to never use them again. He \nstated in his FORM Response that he has removed himself from the individuals with \nwhom he used hallucinogens, and that he remained in contact with one individual, who \n\u201cis rarely in my life, with only occasional text messages.\u201d (Items 1-4; AE A) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and \nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant \nor proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion \nto obtain a favorable security decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse as: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \u201c(a) any substance misuse . . . ;\u201d \u201c(c) \nillegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia;\u201d and \n\u201c(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, or failure to \nclearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse.\u201d \nApplicant used and purchased marijuana between 2015 and 2022. He also used \nand purchased hallucinogens between 2015 and 2016. He continues to associate with \ntwo friends with whom he previously used marijuana, one of whom is his roommate, and \nhe knows that his roommate keeps marijuana or marijuana-related paraphernalia in \ntheir residence. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(g) are established. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides the following potentially relevant mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nApplicant used and purchased hallucinogens four times between December 2015 \nand September 2016, nearly seven years ago. He removed himself from the individuals \nwith whom he used hallucinogens and has only rare text message contact with one \nsuch individual. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), 26(b)(1) and 26(b)(2) are established for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and \n1.d, and I find those allegations in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nApplicant used and purchased marijuana more extensively, between May 2015 \nand March 2022. His last use is recent enough that I cannot find that it is unlikely to \nrecur. He continues to associate with the individuals with whom he used marijuana, one \nof whom is his roommate. While he expressed his intent to continue to abstain from \nmarijuana, he did not provide a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse. I also have concerns about his willing awareness \nthat his roommate continues to use and store marijuana in their residence, despite him \ntelling his roommate to not do so. I find that none of the above mitigating conditions are \nestablished for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group.

AG \u00b6 16(e)(1) is \nnot established and I find SOR \u00b6 2.a in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H and Guideline E in this whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. I conclude Applicant mitigated the personal conduct security \nconcern, but he failed to mitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.d: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(TR at page 25 lines 9~13, PHXs B and F.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations \nApplicant had past-due indebtedness of about $39,561. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. He has a long history of \ndelinquencies. Applicant has yet to address admitted past-due debts totaling about \n$22,499. He has not demonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. Mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6 20 has not been established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial \nConsiderations security concerns. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c.~1.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g. and 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 5, 2023, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued to Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 6, 2023, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on March 20, \n2023.

The case was assigned to me on June 1, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted both SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 53 years old. He attended college but did not earn a degree. He \nmarried in 1997 and separated from his wife in 1999. He has no children. He has worked \nfor his present employer, a federal contractor, since December 2021. In his April 2022 \nsecurity clearance application (SCA), he did not disclose any periods of unemployment. \n(Item 3) \nThe SOR alleges a defaulted and charged-off mortgage (\u00b6 1.a - $39,289) and a \ncable bill (\u00b6 1.b - $131). Applicant disclosed the real estate debt in his SCA and stated: \nA second mortgage company purchased my mortgage so my automated \npayments were going to the wrong institution. When I realized the error I \nstarted making payments to the correct bank but they were rejecting \npayments. They added fees that almost doubled the mortgage so I let it go \ninto foreclosure.  \nThe case is closed and I have a check coming for the excess funds from \nthe sale. \nThe home was sold for more than I owed the bank. (Item 3) \nIn June 2022, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. Regarding \nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a, he said that he owned rental property that was foreclosed. The \nbank sold his mortgage, and his payments went to the company. He received a judgment \nletter from the county court stating the home was in foreclosure. He said that he sold the \nhouse in January 2022 because the property was not being properly maintained, and he \nwas going to receive a refund because it was sold for more than what was owed. (Item \n6) \nRegarding the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b, Applicant told the investigator that he closed the \ncable account and received a refund. The following month, he was told he had a balance \nowed of $131. He said he spoke with the creditor at the time he received the new bill and \nexplained that he received a refund. He said he had no intention of paying it. In his SOR \nanswer, he admitted the debt.

(Items 4, 5) \nApplicant did not respond to the FORM and did not provide any documents to show \nthe line of credit account is paid and the debt resolved. He did not provide evidence that \nhe has disputed or resolved the cable bill. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant admitted he owed the line of credit mortgage account and cable bill \nalleged in his SOR answer. He told the investigator he was going to receive a refund from \nthe sale of his rental property. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of \nthe above disqualifying conditions. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant disclosed that he owned rental property. His mortgage was sold, his \nautomatic payments were sent to the wrong bank causing him to default on the mortgage, \nand the property was foreclosed. Applicant said it was sold for more than the mortgage \nand he anticipated receiving a refund. Although initially the foreclosure may have been \nbeyond his control, he failed to provide any evidence that the mortgage debt or cable bill \nare resolved, despite being put on notice that he was required to provide supporting \ndocumentation. None of the mitigating conditions are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline, F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to his eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For \nall these reasons, I conclude he failed to mitigate the security concerns raised under \nGuideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs   1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He was afforded an \nopportunity to file objections and to submit material in refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation. He was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to do so. He received the \nFORM on February 28, 2023. He responded on March 1, 2023, and submitted comments. \nHe did not note any objections to the Government\u2019s proposed evidence.

After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 23-year-old contractor. (Item 3 at 3) He has never been married and \nhas no children. (Item 3 at 18-19) He earned his associate degree in May 2020 and \nbachelor\u2019s degree in May 2022. (Item 3 at 9-10) He has been employed as a contractor \nsince June 2021. (Item 3 at 11) He has not served in the military. (Item 3 at 16) \nThe allegations in the SOR concern Applicant\u2019s sporadic use of marijuana from \nabout June 2016 to about March 2022 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); his use of hallucinogenic mushrooms \non approximately three occasions between June 2020 and November 2021 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); \nand his use of cocaine on approximately two occasions between July 2020 and June \n2021 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). \nApplicant used marijuana recreationally with varying frequency while in high school \nand college, from about June 2016 to March 2022. Applicant believes he used marijuana \non no more than 40 occasions over that six-year period. While in college, he used \nhallucinogenic mushrooms on approximately three occasions between June 2020 and \nNovember 2021 and he used cocaine on approximately two occasions between July 2020 \nand June 2021. (Items 2-4 and Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM) \nApplicant admitted his use of drugs in his SCA, in his adopted subject interview of \nJuly 5, 2022, in his answer to the SOR, and in his response to the FORM.

His statements have remained consistent. He stated \nhe has not used hallucinogenic mushrooms for over 18 months, cocaine for almost two \nyears, and marijuana for over a year. He further stated he no longer associates with \nfriends who continue to use drugs. In his subject interview, he provided the names those \nwith whom he used drugs and contact information for the friends he still associated with \nbut whom, he said, also no longer use illegal drugs. He stated he regrets his former drug \nuse, it was foolish and immature, and he pledges to abstain from any future use. (Items \n3-4 and Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d 484 \nU.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship transcends \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnormal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government reposes a \nhigh degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the security concern regarding drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription drugs, and the use of other substances that can cause physical \nor mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended use can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant admitted his drug use in his May 2022 SCA, his July 2022 interview with \na government investigator, his answer to the SOR, and his March 2023 response to the \nFORM. His drug use has been relatively recent. \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 25 \nand the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nAG \u00b6 25(a) applies because the illegal use of marijuana, hallucinogenic \nmushrooms, and cocaine, all Schedule I controlled substances under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c), \nconstitute substance misuse. AG \u00b6 25(c) also applies. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited \nto:  \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nConsidering all the evidence, mitigating conditions AG \u00b6 26(a) and AG \u00b6 26(b)(1)-\n(3) are satisfied.  Applicant acknowledged his prior drug use in his SCA. He states he has \ndisassociated himself from his prior drug-using friends. His last drug use was in college, \nand he graduated in May 2022. He stated in his SCA and in his response to the FORM \nthat he intends to abstain from all drug involvement and understands any such \ninvolvement could affect his eligibility. He has established a pattern of abstinence and \nthough the time period has been relatively short, his statements appear to be sincere.  \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. \nThe use of illegal substances is incompatible with eligibility for a security clearance \nand can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. Applicant is \ncautioned that any future use of an illegal substance could render him ineligible to hold a \nsecurity clearance. \nI conclude Applicant provided sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns \nabout his drug involvement and substance misuse. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme satisfied as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is 63 years old. He is married and has three adult children. He graduated high school in 1978 and took some college courses through 1982 but did not receive a degree. He obtained his first security clearance in 1987 and has held a security clearance for most of his career. He has been with his current employer as a network engineer since 2018. (GX 2, 3) The SOR allegations concern a charged-off home equity loan of $89,482; five delinquent student loans totaling about $77,000; several years of unfiled federal and state income tax returns; about $25,000 in delinquent federal income taxes; and about $4,000 in delinquent state income taxes. The home equity and student loan debts are established by Applicant\u2019s credit reports from December 2019, April 2020, and May 2022, as well as his admissions. The tax allegations are established by Applicant\u2019s January 2020 SCA, April 2020 background interview summary, and his November 2022 Interrogatory Response.

He elected a decision on the written record by an administrative judge from \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), in lieu of a hearing. On December \n27, 2022, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material \n(FORM), including exhibits (GX) 1 through 7. Applicant received the FORM on January \n5, 2023.

He responded on January 20, 2023, and provided \na statement with additional information.

GX 2-7, AX 1-9, and the FORM Response are \nadmitted without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.f and denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.g-1.j with explanations. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After \na thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 63 years old. He is married and has three adult children. He \ngraduated high school in 1978 and took some college courses through 1982 but did not \nreceive a degree. He obtained his first security clearance in 1987 and has held a \nsecurity clearance for most of his career. He has been with his current employer as a \nnetwork engineer since 2018. (GX 2, 3) \nThe SOR allegations concern a charged-off home equity loan of $89,482; five \ndelinquent student loans totaling about $77,000; several years of unfiled federal and \nstate income tax returns; about $25,000 in delinquent federal income taxes; and about \n$4,000 in delinquent state income taxes. The home equity and student loan debts are \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s credit reports from December 2019, April 2020, and May \n2022, as well as his admissions. The tax allegations are established by Applicant\u2019s \nJanuary 2020 SCA, April 2020 background interview summary, and his November 2022 \nInterrogatory Response. (GX 1-7) \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues began in 2016 when he started a new job. Within a \nfew months, his company changed the status of his position from W-2 employee to \n1099 contractor. As a result, the company stopped taking income tax deductions out of \nhis paycheck, but he did not timely pay the taxes when due. Soon afterwards, his pay \nfrom the company became erratic. The company also failed to submit required tax forms \nfor 2016 and 2017. In early 2018, the company abruptly stopped issuing any paychecks. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant resigned in April 2018. In 2019, he sued the company for lost wages and \nreceived a settlement of $45,000, minus attorney fees. (GX 3; AX 3-4) \nAlso in 2016, Applicant\u2019s parents became ill and moved in with him. He began \nmanaging their finances and medical appointments. Later that year, his father passed \naway, and his mother passed away in 2017. Applicant stated that the inconsistent \nincome and time spent caring for his parents led to financial strain. (GX 1-3) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($89,482) is a charged-off home equity loan that became delinquent \nin 2018. Applicant claimed he made multiple attempts to contact the creditor and set up \na payment plan. Eventually, he was informed the debt had been sold. He did not specify \nwhen this occurred. However, in about October 2021, a collection agency sued him for \nthe debt. Later that month, he settled with the agency and agreed to make $800 \nmonthly payments toward the balance of $94,282. Records show that he made timely \npayments from November 2021 through October 2022, and he intends to continue to \nmake payments. (GX 1-3, 5-7; AX 1-2) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($21,128), 1.c ($19,637), 1.d ($17,399), 1.e ($15,907) and 1.f \n($2,884) are delinquent federal student loans in collection. From about 2010 through \n2015, Applicant cosigned on student loans for both of his daughters. His first daughter \nmade payments on her loans. His second daughter did not. Applicant knew that his \nsecond daughter\u2019s student loans were in collection. However, he claimed he was not \nresponsible for the loans because his second daughter had agreed to pay them. (GX 3, \n5-7) \nIn his Answer, Applicant claimed his second daughter was working on a payment \nplan under which he would be removed from the loans after one year of timely \npayments. He was not aware of the status of his second daughter\u2019s payment plan but \nclaimed the loans had been removed from his credit report. The student loans still show \nas collection accounts attributable to Applicant in all the credit reports in the record. (GX \n1, 5-7) \nSua sponte I take administrative notice that, as of this writing, the repayment of \nseveral federal student loans has been in forbearance status due to the COVID-19 \npandemic under multiple Presidential Executive Orders since March 2020. Federal \nstudent loan payments remain paused until at least June 30, 2023. See \nhttps://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges that Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax \nreturns for tax years 2016, 2017 and 2018. He denied the allegation but admitted that \nhe did not timely file his tax returns for those years, as alleged. Applicant attributed the \nfiling delay to his company\u2019s failure to issue tax forms in 2016 and 2017 and his own \nlack of funds to deal with the unexpected tax liability. (GX 1) \nDuring his April 2020 background interview, Applicant also attributed the delayed \nfilings to his own \u201cprocrastination.\u201d He stated his first daughter was an accountant and \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhad assisted him with his taxes. He claimed he had filed his 2018 tax return in spring \n2020, but did not provide any evidence of the filing. He intended on filing his 2016 and \n2017 tax returns by May 2020. (GX 3) \nIn his November 2022 Interrogatory Response, Applicant asserted that he filed \nhis 2016, 2017, and 2018 income tax returns in January and February 2022 and \nincluded an unsigned copy of his 2017 tax return. He also disclosed that his 2015 tax \nreturn was filed in July 2018 and his 2019, 2020, and 2021 income tax returns were filed \nin November 2022. These additional years of late tax filings are not alleged in the SOR. \n(GX 3) \nIn a November 2022 letter, Applicant\u2019s first daughter, the accountant, stated she \nhad been assisting him with his taxes since 2014. She first worked with a large \naccounting firm and opened her own firm in 2021. She detailed that Applicant brought \nhis 2016, 2017, and 2018 tax documents to her in May 2020. She claimed that the tax \nreturns for those three years were submitted to the IRS in January 2022. She blamed \ndifficulties within her own office for the additional filing delays. (GX 3) \nApplicant\u2019s daughter also stated that she helped him file his 2019, 2020 and \n2021 federal income tax returns in September 2022. She provided a summary of the \nfilings on her company\u2019s letterhead but did not include any documentation from the IRS \nconfirming these later filings. (GX 3) \nIRS account transcripts confirm that Applicant\u2019s 2016 tax return was filed in \nJanuary 2022. As of February 2022, account transcripts reflect that his 2017 and 2018 \ntax returns had not been filed. However, in a November 2022 correspondence, the IRS \nnotified Applicant that his 2017 tax return had been received, but could not be \nprocessed without the submission of additional information. The record does not contain \nconfirmation from the IRS that his 2017 and 2018 tax returns were filed. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i ($25,534) alleges Applicant owes delinquent federal taxes for 2017, \n2019, and 2020. He denied the allegation but admitted that he initially had a balance of \nabout $28,500 in delinquent taxes, of which he had paid $3,500. He asserted that he \nhad filed an Installment Agreement with his 2021 tax return and was paying $500 per \nmonth toward his delinquent taxes. \nAn undated and unsigned Federal Installment Agreement Request shows that \nApplicant proposed a payment plan of $395 per month. IRS account transcripts and a \npayment activity summary show that, in November and December 2022, Applicant paid \nabout $20,000 toward his delinquent taxes. Most of these payments were directed \ntoward his 2016 tax debt that now shows as paid. (GX 3-4; AX 6-7) \nIn the FORM Response, Applicant\u2019s daughter the accountant stated that \nApplicant had submitted his 2021 tax return and that he was current with his tax \nobligations.

He denied the allegation but admitted that he did not timely \nfile his tax returns for those years, as alleged. Applicant asserted that his state income \ntax returns had been filed and the timing of those filings mirrored his federal filings. \nState tax documents from August through November 2022 support Applicant\u2019s assertion \nthat the state tax returns were received and processed. These include a Notice of State \nTax Computation, Notices of Intercepted Refunds, and the issuance of a refund. (GX 1, \n3; AX 5, 8-9) \nSOR \u00b6 1.j ($3,797) alleges Applicant owes delinquent state taxes for 2016 and \n2017. He admitted that he previously owed the state delinquent taxes, but claims he has \nsince paid the taxes in full. Applicant claimed that refunds for tax years 2019, 2020 and \n2021 were partially intercepted to satisfy his state tax debt. State tax documents confirm \nthat the tax debt for 2016 and 2017 was paid through intercepted refunds. The \nremaining funds were released to him. (GX 1, 3; AX 5, 8-9) \nApplicant asserted that he was \u201casset heavy\u201d with about $5,000,000 in assets. \nHis daughter the accountant stated that he continues to pay over the agreed monthly \ninstallment toward his tax debt and he will continue to be current on his future tax \nliabilities. She also provided character evidence in which she described him as having \ngreat judgment and self-discipline and was of high character, integrity and credibility. \n(GX 3; FORM Response) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThe financial security concern is broader than the possibility that an individual \nmight knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money.

May 1, \n2012) \nWhile difficulty in meeting financial obligations may force an applicant to choose \nthe order in which he or she addresses unpaid debts, they do not provide a plausible \nexcuse for failing to meet an important legal requirement, such as filing returns when \ndue. ISCR Case No. 15-03019 at 6 (App. Bd. Jul. 5, 2017) Failure to file tax returns \nsuggests that an applicant has a problem complying with well-established governmental \nrules and systems.

Dec. 20, \n2002) \nThe adjudicative guideline notes several conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income taxes as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for 2016, \n2017 and 2018 as required. He owed delinquent taxes for several years. He also had a \nsubstantial home equity loan charged off for failure to pay. Despite having the apparent \nfinancial means to do so, he refused to pay the delinquent student loans that he \ncosigned for his second daughter. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThere are five conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security concerns \narising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties:  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nIn 2016, Applicant was not prepared to navigate the change of his employment \nstatus from W-2 company employee to 1099 contractor. He also experienced erratic pay \nthat ultimately led to his resignation and the filing of a lawsuit against the company for \nlost wages. At the same time, Applicant took on the responsibility of caring for both of \nhis parents until their passing. These were circumstances beyond his control. \nApplicant also took some steps toward addressing his financial situation. Over \nthe last two years, he established and maintained a payment plan to resolve his \ncharged-off home equity loan. In addition, he recently made significant payments toward \nhis federal tax debt and is maintaining a payment plan for the remaining balance. He \nalso resolved his state tax debt through payment. \nHowever, Applicant has not taken responsibility for the $77,000 in cosigned \nstudent loan debt. These loans were already delinquent for years prior to the COVID-\nrelated moratorium on payments, and the credit reports in the record show the loans are \nstill in collection status. He remains obligated to pay the loans. By selectively \ndisregarding substantial debts, he has not shown responsible action under the \ncircumstances. Neither AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) or 20(d) fully apply. \nApplicant has also made some progress toward addressing his tax issues. \nRecently, he made significant payments toward his federal tax debt and is issuing \nmonthly payments for the remainder under an installment agreement. He has also \nresolved his state tax debt. \nHowever, Applicant failed to file his 2016, 2017 and 2018 federal and state \nincome tax returns on time as required. While he described his company\u2019s inability to \nprovide necessary tax forms as the primary reason for the delay, other contributing \nfactors included his own lack of funds and admitted procrastination. He did not begin to \naddress the filings until 2020, when he submitted paperwork to his daughter the \naccountant. Her office then took nearly two years to submit the tax returns. While she \nattempted to take responsibility for the delay, this is not an isolated event for Applicant. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe record reflects that Applicant additionally failed to timely file his 2015, 2019, \n2020 and 2021 federal and state income tax returns. These late-filed returns are not \nalleged in the SOR, but they undercut assertions of mitigation and changed \ncircumstances because his tax filing problems are ongoing. Even with the assistance of \nhis daughter, Applicant has not established that he is able to meet his tax obligations as \nrequired. His payment efforts do not mitigate his failures to file his tax returns in a timely \nmanner for several years. AG \u00b6 20(g) does not fully apply. \nApplicant has entered into a payment agreement on his charged-off home equity \nloan and made significant payments toward his tax debt. He also received some \nassistance from his daughter, the accountant, to bring his tax obligations current. \nHowever, the delinquent student loans for which he cosigned remain ongoing and \nunresolved. He has not yet shown he can consistently meet his tax obligations. He has \nnot established that his delinquent debts or tax issues are due to circumstances that are \nunlikely to recur or no longer cast doubt on his judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. \nNeither AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) or 20(c) fully apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant first obtained a security clearance in 1987 and has held a clearance for \nmost of his career. His financial issues began in 2016 when his company failed to meet \ntheir pay schedule or issue necessary tax documents. At the same time, he had to \nmanage the care of both of his parents who passed away just over a year apart from \neach other. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nSince obtaining his current employment in 2018, Applicant has made some \nprogress in addressing his debts, including entering into a payment plan for his home \nequity loan and paying a majority of his delinquent taxes. However, he refused to \naddress the student loan debt that he cosigned for because he believes it is solely his \ndaughter\u2019s responsibility. Additionally, instead of addressing his delayed tax filings \ncloser in time to when they occurred, he allowed his tax situation to cascade over the \nnext five years. While he has made some progress in bringing his tax situation current, \nhe has not shown that he is able to remain in compliance with his tax obligations. His \nactions are insufficient to overcome the ongoing security concerns. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the financial security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i and 1.j:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

Applicant claimed that, during this time, her financial \nsituation improved. However, in 2013, Applicant resigned from this position because of \nwhat she described as an \u201cunprofessional relationship\u201d with a coworker. After about six \nmonths, Applicant was able to secure new employment, but with a significant pay cut, \nearning about $24,000 annually. From 2013 through 2020, she maintained full-time \nemployment, but at continually low salaries. (GX 2-3; FORM Response) \nIn 2016, Applicant\u2019s husband, who remained in the military at the time, deployed \nfor a year. Applicant described experiencing marital difficulties during this period and \nfacing a \u201chuge financial burden.\u201d Paying her expenses was not a priority and she \nallowed another vehicle to be repossessed (\u00b6 1.a) because she was not using it at the \ntime. (GX 2-4) \nApplicant\u2019s husband began experiencing health issues a few months after his \nreturn from the deployment. In 2019, he underwent heart surgery and received a \nmedical discharge from the military. In May 2020, Applicant and her husband moved \nfrom State A to State B to be close to his son (her stepson). At the time of their move, \nApplicant secured a new offer of employment. However, the offer was later withdrawn \nbecause of work shutdowns related to COVID-19. Applicant was able to secure new \nemployment, beginning in June 2020. Still, she described experiencing further financial \nstrain during this period following the move. (GX 2-3; AX B; FORM Response) \nSince starting with her current employer in April 2021, Applicant has received two \nsignificant pay raises. She now earns an annual salary of approximately $80,500. She \nand her husband also receive military disability payments. Applicant stated that their \ncombined earnings are just under $200,000 per year. (GX 2-3; AX D; FORM Response) \nIn December 2022, following her receipt of the SOR, Applicant contracted with a \ndebt resolution company to settle her debts. She submitted a total debt of $41,640 for \ninclusion in the company\u2019s program. This included the accounts referenced in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a, 1.m, 1.r, 1.t \u2013 1.v, and 1.x \u2013 1.z. She also included one $666 debt not alleged in the \nSOR. She was to make biweekly payments of $318 into the program over 48 months. \nThe company would then use those funds to negotiate the settlement of Applicant\u2019s \ndebts.

(GX 2; FORM Response) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe financial security concern is broader than the possibility that an individual \nmight knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money. It \nencompasses concerns about an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities \nessential to protecting classified information. An individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012) \nThe adjudicative guideline notes two conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 19 and are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has a long history of financial difficulties. The delinquent debts in the \nSOR, including two charged-off vehicle loans, federal student loans, multiple credit \ncards, payday loans as well as phone and utility accounts are established by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and the credit report in the record. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThere are four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security concerns \narising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nIn 2008, Applicant purchased a vehicle that she quickly realized she could not \nafford. Over the next year, she was honorably discharged from the Army, got married, \nhad a child and returned to school. A few years later, she experienced income loss \nwhen she left her employment. She also experienced marital issues following her \nhusband\u2019s deployment. More recently, her husband had heart surgery and was \nmedically discharged from the military. These events were largely beyond Applicant\u2019s \ncontrol and caused significant stress to her financial circumstances. In December 2022, \nshe hired a debt resolution company to assist her in addressing her delinquent \naccounts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) have some application. \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts remained unresolved for years. Although \nshe started her current position in April 2021, there is no evidence in the record that she \ntook responsible action to address the debts prior to receiving the SOR. Even after \nentering into a debt resolution agreement, Applicant did not provide evidence that she \nmade any payments toward the plan. Meanwhile, Applicant\u2019s federal student loans were \ndelinquent before COVID-19 and are not included in her debt resolution agreement. She \nhas not established any plan to resolve these delinquent loans. Her recent promises to \npay within the debt resolution agreement do not establish responsible action under the \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncircumstances. She has not shown a track record of steady payments towards her \ndebts to establish good faith. Neither AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) or 20(d) fully apply. \nWith the assistance of the debt resolution company, Applicant formulated a \nbudget and devised a plan to resolve her delinquent accounts. However, given the \nlength of time and extent of her delinquent debts, these recent efforts are insufficient to \nestablish that her financial problems are being resolved or are under control. AG \u00b6 20 \n(c) does not fully apply. \nApplicant began experiencing financial difficulties in 2008. In the years that \nfollowed, her financial difficulties extended to include new delinquencies that occurred \nas recently as 2020. Although Applicant recently contracted with a debt resolution \ncompany, she has not established a sufficient track record of payments to conclude that \nthe accounts are being resolved responsibly. Her financial difficulties are recent and \nongoing. Applicant\u2019s financial circumstances continue to cast doubt on her current \nreliability, judgment and trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant served in the Army and received an honorable discharge. She \npreviously held a security clearance without incident. Beginning in 2008, she \nexperienced several events that caused significant financial stress. She also \nacknowledged that some of her decisions over time increased her financial stress. \nRecently, she has taken steps to budget and address her financial concerns. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nHowever, even after securing new employment in April 2021, Applicant did not \ntake proximate action to resolve her long-delinquent accounts. Finally, after receipt of \nthe SOR, Applicant formulated a plan to address some of her debts through a debt \nresolution company. Applicant did not include any record of payments into the plan. \nAdditionally, she did not present any plan regarding the resolution of her delinquent \nstudent loans. Her actions are insufficient to overcome the ongoing security concerns. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant did not \nprovide sufficient evidence to mitigate the financial security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.z: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant owed $80,535 for two delinquent federally guaranteed student loan accounts (SOR 1.a and 1.b); and that he owed $7,330 for two delinquent commercial credit accounts (SOR 1.c and 1.d). In response, Applicant admitted each allegation, with explanations, and he provided documents in support of his responses. (Answer) Under Guideline E, SOR 2.a alleged that Applicant intentionally made a false official statement in his March 2022 e-QIP. Specifically, it was alleged that he deliberately omitted from his e-QIP the debts alleged at SOR 1.a \u2013 1.d by answering \u201cNo\u201d to questions under Section 26 (Financial Record) that required him to disclose whether, in the preceding seven years, he had debts more than 120 days past due. Applicant admitted SOR 2.a, with explanation. However, in reviewing the pleadings at hearing, Applicant denied that he intentionally made a false statement through his e- QIP answers. Accordingly, I entered his response as a denial, thus making the question 2 of his intent to falsify a controverted question of fact. (Tr. 13 \u2013 15; see also Directive, Section E3.1.14) In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of relevant fact.

Based on the results of the ensuing background \ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DCSA CAF) could not affirmatively determine that it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn December 12, 2022, DCSA CAF issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns under the adjudicative guidelines for \nfinancial considerations (Guideline F) and personal conduct (Guideline E). The DOD CAF \nissued the SOR pursuant to Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960); Department of Defense (DOD) Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, \nestablishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and asked for a hearing before \nan administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). I was \nassigned this case on April 27, 2023. On June 5, 2023, I convened a hearing by video \nteleconferencing. The parties appeared as scheduled, and I received a transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on June 14, 2023. \nDepartment Counsel proffered Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 6, as well as a list of \nGovernment exhibits and a copy of a discovery letter dated March 17, 2023, which are \nincluded as Hearing Exhibits (HX) 1 and 2, respectively. \nApplicant testified in his own behalf, but he did not present any documentary \nevidence. I held the record open after the hearing to receive additional relevant \ninformation. Applicant timely submitted three exhibits identified as AX A - C. No objections \nto admissibility were raised by either party and all proffered exhibits were admitted. The \nrecord closed on June 13, 2023, when Department Counsel waived objections to \nApplicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant owed $80,535 for two \ndelinquent federally guaranteed student loan accounts (SOR 1.a and 1.b); and that he \nowed $7,330 for two delinquent commercial credit accounts (SOR 1.c and 1.d). In \nresponse, Applicant admitted each allegation, with explanations, and he provided \ndocuments in support of his responses. (Answer) \nUnder Guideline E, SOR 2.a alleged that Applicant intentionally made a false \nofficial statement in his March 2022 e-QIP. Specifically, it was alleged that he deliberately \nomitted from his e-QIP the debts alleged at SOR 1.a \u2013 1.d by answering \u201cNo\u201d to questions \nunder Section 26 (Financial Record) that required him to disclose whether, in the \npreceding seven years, he had debts more than 120 days past due. \nApplicant admitted SOR 2.a, with explanation. However, in reviewing the pleadings \nat hearing, Applicant denied that he intentionally made a false statement through his e-\nQIP answers.

(Tr. 13 \u2013 15; see also Directive, \nSection E3.1.14) In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make \nthe following findings of relevant fact. \nApplicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor, for whom he has \nworked since March 2021. He previously held a security clearance while working for a \nfederal contractor between September 2008 and September 2016. He applied for that \nclearance through an e-QIP he submitted on June 3, 2010. (GX 1; GX 2) \nApplicant graduated from college in August 2008. He funded his tuition through the \nstudent loans addressed in SOR 1.a and 1.b. Thereafter, he moved to State A, where, as \nnoted above, he worked as a federal contractor. His annual salary ranged between \n$35,000 and $55,000. In his 2010 e-QIP, Applicant disclosed that he was or had been \ndelinquent on three commercial credit accounts (not alleged in the SOR), and that he was \ndelinquent or past due on his student loans, which then totaled about $51,000. The \ncommercial accounts appear to have been paid off. As to his student loans, after \nApplicant\u2019s income tax refund was diverted toward those accounts in 2009, he set up a \nrepayment plan and made monthly payments of $387. He managed to make those \npayments for about a year, and he has not made a regular payment on his student loans \nsince 2010. (GX 2; GX 6; Tr. 49 \u2013 52, 55 \u2013 56, 61 \u2013 64) \nApplicant next acted on his student loans in January 2023, when he contacted a \ncredit repair and debt negotiation company. With his Answer, he provided information that \nshows the credit repair firm has contacted his creditors. That information does not show \nthat he is making any payments on his student loans or other debts. Applicant testified \nthat he pays that firm $100 monthly for their services. On June 5, 2023, Applicant enrolled \nin a debt repayment plan that requires him to make bi-weekly payments of $135 to satisfy \nthe debts at SOR 1.c and 1.d, as well as three other debts not alleged in the SOR, totaling \n$17,081. The plan would resolve those debts in four years. (Answer; AX A; AX B; Tr. 56 \n\u2013 59) \nOn June 9, 2023, Applicant enrolled in a student loan rehabilitation program \n(\u201cFresh Start Transfer\u201d) to resolve five student loan accounts totaling $82,242. Available \ninformation reflects that he has asked for his payments to be based on his income; \nhowever, the record does not reflect a monthly payment or schedule of payments. (AX C) \nApplicant attributes his current financial problems to an extended period of \nunemployment. In 2016, he left his federal contractor employment in State A and moved \nto State B to assist his sister and her children. His sister was seriously ill and could not \nafford in-home care. After Applicant used up his savings to support himself, he opened \nthe credit card accounts alleged at SOR 1.c and 1.d. Additionally, his sister and parents \nhelped him financially from time to time. Applicant returned to the workforce in October \n2019, when he took an information technology (IT) position at a local hospital. He earned \nabout $17 hourly before taking a job with the contractor sponsoring his current request \nfor clearance in March 2021. In February 2023, Applicant was suspended without pay \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfrom his current employment pending the outcome of this adjudication. (Answer; GX 1; \nGX 2; Tr. 38 \u2013 47, 61 \u2013 64) \nApplicant did not disclose any of his delinquent debts when he submitted his e-\nQIP in March 2022. He discussed his financial problems, including his student loans, with \na government investigator in an April 2022 personal subject interview (PSI). He initially \ndenied that he had any delinquent debts until the investigator confronted him with credit \nreport information about those debts. In his hearing testimony, he acknowledged that he \nwas familiar with the information required in response to e-QIP questions by virtue of the \nfact that he had submitted a similar questionnaire in 2010. He further admitted that he \nintentionally answered \u201cNo\u201d to the e-QIP because he did not have current information \nabout his student loans and other debts. (GX 1; GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 48 \u2013 49, 61 \u2013 64, 68 \u2013 \n69) \nApplicant and his wife have been married since June 2022. They have no children \ntogether; however, Applicant has a young child from a previous relationship for whom he \npays about $425 monthly in child support. His wife earns about $70,000 annually, and his \nbrother has been covering the aforementioned child support payments since November \n2022. Additionally, Applicant\u2019s parents have been paying his half of their rent. Applicant \nand his wife do not manage their monthly finances according to a structured budget, and \nbecause Applicant\u2019s income tax refunds are diverted to his student loan accounts, they \nfile their taxes separately. Applicant is current on all of his income tax reporting and \npayment obligations. (Tr. 37, 66 \u2013 68, 74 \u2013 76) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 \n(1988)) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(Egan at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Government met its burden of producing sufficient, reliable information to \nsupport the SOR allegations that Applicant accrued significant past-due or delinquent \ndebts. This information reasonably raises a security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances \nthat is articulated at AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAvailable information also requires consideration of the AG \u00b6 20 mitigating \nconditions that pertain to these facts and circumstances: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s debts are multiple, and by virtue of the fact \nnone of them are resolved, they are recent and ongoing. \nAs to AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d), Applicant asserts his financial troubles stem from his \nextended unemployment between 2016 and 2019. Standing by itself, that circumstance \nwould require application of the first prong of this mitigating condition. However, as \ndocumented in his first e-QIP, Applicant has had financial problems since he graduated \nfrom college in 2008. He only made regular student loan payments for about a year in \n2009 and 2010 through a repayment plan he established after his income tax refund was \ndiverted in 2009. Between 2010 and 2023, he took no identifiable action to address any \nof his debts, and it was only after his hearing that he established a repayment plan for his \ncommercial debts and entered a student loan rehabilitation program for those debts. \nThese are admirable steps and should be encouraged; however, he did not timely act to \naddress any of his debts, even after discussing them with an investigator as a security \nissue in April 2022. The foregoing does not support a finding that he acted responsibly in \nthe face of any unforeseen circumstances or that he has engaged in a good-faith effort to \nrepay his debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) do not apply. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) applies, but only in a limited way. At a cost of $100 a month, Applicant \nengaged the services of a firm that offers to challenge entries in one\u2019s credit history. It \nmay also be that this firm provides credit and financial counseling services, but he did not \npresent any information to that effect. On balance, Applicant did not establish any track \nrecord of payment or other efforts to resolve his debts. Nor did he show how his personal \nfinances are now being managed in a way that would preclude a recurrence of the security \nconcerns identified in the Government\u2019s information. Those concerns remain unresolved. \nPersonal Conduct \nThe security concern addressed under this guideline is stated at AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nApplicant did not disclose in his e-QIP, as required by the questions in Section 26 \n(Financial Record), the debts alleged at SOR 1.a \u2013 1.d. To be disqualifying, such an \nomission must be an intentional attempt to deceive the government about information \nrelevant and material to its interest in ensuring the suitability of persons with security \nclearances. A simple mistake or misunderstanding resulting in an incorrect answer is not \nsufficient. In response to SOR 2.a, Applicant denied having such intent. Thus, it fell to the \nGovernment to provide sufficient information to support the allegation and prove intent. \nSpecifically, at issue is whether the record supports application of the disqualifying \ncondition at AG \u00b6 16(a): \ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nI conclude it does. Applicant\u2019s completion of an in e-QIP in 2010, in which he \nanswered \u201cyes\u201d to the same questions and provided information about the same student \nloan delinquencies at issue here, shows that he understood what information was \nrequired of him. Further, at his hearing, he testified that he knew he should have disclosed \nhis debts but deliberately answered \u201cNo\u201d because he did not have detailed information \nabout his debts. Although it was not alleged in the SOR, I also note that Applicant may \nhave tried to conceal his debts during his April 2022 PSI. Available information shows he \nhad to be confronted with the information about his debts before he acknowledged he \nowed them. All of the information in this record probative of his state of mind when he \nsubmitted his 2022 e-QIP supports application of AG \u00b6 16(a). \nI also considered the following AG \u00b6 17 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant did not try to correct his omissions before being confronted with the \ninformation about his debts in his PSI. He also did not establish that he omitted his debts \npursuant to any qualified advice. Finally, this recent instance of deliberate omission \nundermines confidence that Applicant will act in the best interests of the government in \nprotecting sensitive information. Accordingly, it cannot be viewed as minor and it reflects \nadversely on Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness and judgment. All of the foregoing precludes \napplication of AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a), 16(b), and 16(c). Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns about his personal conduct. \nI also have considered the potential application of the whole-person factors at \u00b6 \n2(d). The record evidence as a whole leaves unresolved the doubts about Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for a clearance that have been raised by the Government\u2019s information. \nBecause protection of the national interest is the principal focus of these adjudications, \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \nthose remaining doubts must be resolved against the granting of access to classified \ninformation. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations with explanations. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 32-year-old security officer employed by a federal contractor since February 2022. He was employed as a security officer by a non-federal employer from April 2012 until June 2014, when he was fired for flashing his company-issued firearm at a driver who had been tailgating him. The tailgating driver notified the police, who arrested Applicant, confiscated his firearm, and charged him with assault with a dangerous weapon. Applicant was placed on ankle monitoring for six months, after which the charge was dismissed. He was unemployed from June 2014 to March 2016. He was employed as a security officer by several non-federal employers from March 2016 until he was hired by his current employer. He has never held a security clearance. Applicant attended university classes from June 2009 to June 2015 but did not receive a degree. He incurred the delinquent student loans alleged in the SOR during this time. He has resided with a cohabitant since November 2021. He has no children.

(FORM \nItem 3) He did not submit any information showing his income and expenses at the time \nthe student loan payments became due, nor did he submit any current financial \ninformation. \nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act \n(CARES Act) became law, and it provided for relief measures on Department of \nEducation-owned federal student loans. This student-loan debt relief received several \nextensions. The CARES Act was followed by a DOE debt-relief program that was \nstalled by litigation, and the pause in student-loan payments remains in effect. (See \nwww.studentaid.gov.) \n. \nA credit report from May 2022 reflects that all of Applicant\u2019s student loans were \nassigned to the U.S. Government for collection between February 2012 and September \n2015. (FORM Item 4) Notwithstanding the pause in student loan payments Appellant\u2019s \nstudent loans were delinquent before the CARES Act and subsequent COVID payment \npause went into effect. Accordingly, there is a concern that Appellant will not make \npayments on his student loans if collection of payments is resumed. \nA recent credit report dated March 2, 2023, reflects that the credit-card account \nhas been paid in full, and payments on another car loan that is not alleged in the SOR \nare current. However, it also reflects that payments on the charged-off car loan are still \npast due in the amount alleged in the SOR, and it reflects a telecommunications bill, not \nalleged in the SOR, that became delinquent in May 2020 has been referred for \ncollection of $145. (FORM Item 6) I have considered the unalleged charge of assault \nwith a dangerous weapon and the unalleged telecommunications bill for the limited \npurpose of evaluating Applicant's evidence of extenuation and mitigation. See ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in\nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).\n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd.

The following mitigating conditions are \npotentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent,\nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely.\n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant\u2019s unemployment from June 2014 to \nMarch 2016 was due to his misconduct. His underemployment and reduced work hours \ndue to COVID were conditions beyond his control, but he has not acted responsibly.

He stated in his \nanswer to the SOR that he had made a payment agreement for the delinquent car loan, \nbut he submitted no documentation of an agreement. His single payment on the car \nloan falls short of a track record of timely payments. He submitted no evidence of \ncontacts with his other creditors or efforts to make payment plans that were affordable \nwith his reduced income. He provided no evidence of his living expenses or income \nhistory. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant submitted evidence that he resolved a \ndelinquent credit-card account and made one payment on his delinquent car loan, but \nhe did not do so until he received the SOR and realized that his delinquent debts could \nprevent him from obtaining a security clearance. Evidence of past irresponsibility is not \nmitigated by payment of debts under pressure of qualifying for a security clearance. \nApplicants who begin to address their security-significant conduct only when their \npersonal interests are at stake may be lacking in judgment and reliability. ISCR Case \nNo. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested \na determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent \ndebts. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

She said this was an isolated incident, and in the \nfuture, she would not consume alcohol and drive, or go to work after consuming alcohol. \n(Item 2) \nPolicies \nThe national security eligibility action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG), which became effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process.

The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of variables \nknown as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable, and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination \nunder this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 describes the security concerns pertaining to alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 22 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case.

She was subsequently arrested and charged with DUI, after failing \nsobriety and blood tests. In January 2022, she pleaded guilty to the DUI. The evidence \nraised the above disqualifying conditions, thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to rebut, \nextenuate, or mitigate those concerns. \nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns under this \nguideline. Four may potentially apply in this case: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant was arrested for DUI in July 2021, less than two years ago.

She did not present documentation that she \nsuccessfully completed the court-ordered alcohol education classes or provide the results \nof her alcohol evaluation. There is insufficient evidence to establish any of the above \nmitigating conditions. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 describes the security concerns related to criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. Two may potentially apply: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation. \nIn July 2021, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. In January 2022, she \npleaded guilty to DUI, and was placed on probation for a year and ordered to undergo an \nalcohol evaluation and attend AA. After receiving the FORM on January 13, 2023, she \ndid not submit evidence that she had been released from probation or completed the \nother requirements of her sentence. The evidence establishes the above disqualifying \nconditions. \nAG \u00b6 32 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised under \nthis guideline. Two may potentially apply: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nThere is insufficient evidence to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 32(a) for the same \nreasons set forth above, under AG \u00b6 23(a). There is no evidence that Applicant \nsuccessfully complied with the terms of her probation and was released from it. She did \nnot provide evidence that she completed the other terms of her sentence. She did not \nsubmit evidence of a good employment record since July 2021, or other evidence of \nsuccessful rehabilitation. There is insufficient evidence to establish mitigation under AG \n\u00b6 32(d). \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains the security concerns relating to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. Two may potentially apply: \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing; \n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to \nthe employer as a condition of employment. \nWhen Applicant came to work inebriated on July 22, 2022, she exhibited \nintoxicated and inappropriate conduct that created a vulnerability to duress because it \nwould predictably affect her personal and professional standing. It was also in violation of \nseveral conditions of her employment. The evidence establishes both disqualifying \nconditions. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised under this \nguideline.

Applicant acknowledged her \nmisconduct, but did not provide proof that she has participated in counseling, or took other \nsteps to address the underlying factors contributing to her unreliable conduct. She did not \npresent credible evidence to indicate that similar conduct will not recur in her personal life \nor in her work environment. There is insufficient evidence to establish mitigation under \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), or 17(d). Applicant said her family and friends are aware of the situation, \nwhich may reduce her vulnerability to exploitation or duress, so AG \u00b6 17(e) minimally \napplies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \na security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult, who \nis accountable for her decisions and actions. In July 2021, Applicant went to work \ninebriated. She then declined an offered ride, tried to drive home, and was arrested and \ncharged with DUI. In January 2022, she was convicted of DUI and placed on a year-long \nprobation with several court-ordered requirements pertinent to alcohol abuse. She \nsubmitted no evidence confirming that she successfully completed probation or alcohol \ntreatment, and now recognizes the significance of her past behavior. There is no evidence \npertinent her court-ordered alcohol evaluation. The absence of credible evidence of \nrehabilitation precludes a conclusion that she could be relied upon to comply with \nsecurity-related requirements for the protection of classified and sensitive information. \nShe did not meet her burden to mitigate the security concerns arising under the guidelines \nfor alcohol consumption, criminal conduct, and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nConsidering all circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in \nthe SOR. \nApplicant began working for his current employer in May 2015. He provided no \nreal excuse for failing to file his Federal income tax returns, except that he lacked the \nknowledge. He explained that while in the military, on the Naval base in Japan, up until \n2010, he had access to a volunteer service that prepared his income tax returns. In \n2010, they left, and he filed on his own. There were problems and it was returned to \nhim to be corrected and sent back to the IRS. He lost confidence in doing it himself, \nthings snowballed, and he stopped filing his returns. Applicant stated that all of his \nunfiled income tax returns are in the process of being filed. (Applicant\u2019s Answer to \nSOR.) \nNot relevant to this issue, but noted by the Applicant, is the fact that as an \nAmerican living abroad he is entitled to special benefits such as the Foreign Earned \nIncome Exclusion and Foreign Tax Credit.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely file his Federal income tax returns for tax years 2012 \nthrough 2020. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20; \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nDelinquent income tax returns are inconsistent with being cleared for access to \nclassified information. Applicant failed to file his Federal income tax returns as required \nby law, for at least 8 years, from 2012 to 2020. Also, there is no evidence in the record \nregarding whether he filed his 2021 income tax returns. Applicant is aware of the legal \nrequirement to file annual Federal income tax returns in a timely fashion. He stated that \nhis Federal income tax returns in question are in the process of being filed. However, \nthere is no documentary evidence in the record to show that he has taken any steps to \nensure that his tax returns are being filed, or whether they will be filed in a timely basis \ngoing forward. \nApplicant\u2019s inaction for so long reflects a pattern of unreliability, \nuntrustworthiness, and poor judgment. \nAccordingly, Applicant does not meet the \nrequirements to access classified information. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

(Items 6 and 7) He opened \nthis account with the creditor in June 2021, and by June 2022, the account was in a \ncollection status. (Item 6 at 7) In 2023, the creditor assigned the account to a debt \ncollector to continue collection efforts. The collection balance increased from $10,884 to \n$11,066, and the account remains in a collection status. (Item 7 at 8) This debt is \nunresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.k is also an individual account that appears in two credit bureau reports. \n(Items 5 and 6) Applicant opened the account in August 2018.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d EO 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish two disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6  20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control;  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(c) are not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are \nrecent and ongoing, and most of them remain unresolved. He did not provide \ndocumentary evidence to support his case, nor did he explain the circumstances that led \nto his financial problems. He presented no evidence to show his financial problems were \nincurred due to circumstances beyond his control. He did not provide information or \nevidence about his income, expenses, or other financial resources at his disposal. Nor \ndid he provide information or evidence he received or is receiving financial counseling, \nand his financial problems are not under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not fully established. There is evidence Applicant took steps to \naddress his delinquent debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i. In his response to the SOR, he \ncommented, regarding these two debts, that the amount owed on each was \u201cnot that \nmuch,\u201d without explaining or providing context to the comment. Credit bureau reports \nshow the total amount of these debts decreased over time. He gets some credit for taking \nsteps to address these two debts. However, his denial of debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.k is \nnot persuasive. He denied these debts because, as he stated, he did not recognize the \ncreditors. These debts, both individual accounts, were clearly established through credit \nbureau reports. It is well settled that adverse information in credit bureau reports is \nsufficient to establish the Government\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant had delinquent \ndebts that are of security concern. See generally ISCR Case No. 19-02993 (App. Bd. \nNov. 23, 2021). Once established, it is the Applicant\u2019s burden to mitigate the security \nconcern. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. Applicant has not met his burden here. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant failed to establish he disputed any debt \nand that he supported any such dispute with evidence of his actions to resolve it. \nOverall, there is insufficient evidence to determine that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable time. I am unable to find he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. \nHis financial issues continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. Financial considerations security concerns remain in this case. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns.  \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h \u2013 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j \u2013 1.l: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had over $52,000 of admitted past-due debts. \nThe evidence is \nsufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAlthough Applicant can attribute his financial difficulties to the death of a partner \nand to two minor heart attacks, these occurred five to six years ago. Only recently has \nhe begun to address his significant past-due indebtedness. Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems are ongoing, as he still owes in excess of $42,000 to 15 different creditors that \nhe has yet to address. He has not demonstrated that future financial problems are \nunlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has not been established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant has a \ndistinguished history of working in the defense industry. He performs well at his job. \n(AppX A.) Overall, however, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts \nas to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, \nI conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial Considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.~1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.e.~1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.l. and 1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.n: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.p: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.q. and 1.r: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.s:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.u: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

The IRS confirmed receipt of the 2019 federal tax return. Applicant \nworked for years to resolve the debts of his failed business venture. He entered an \nagreement to settle the $78,085 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a for $10,000. The amount of \nthe debt to be resolved is approximately $7,132. (Response to FORM) \nThe current status of the SOR allegations are: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a:  $78,085 debt placed for collection: Applicant states this is a business \nloan. He was a co-signer on the loan. He mentions he has learned that the lender is \nknown as a predatory lender. He and his lawyer worked for years to settle this debt. On \nApril 18, 2023, the case was settled for $10,000. Applicant paid two $2,500 payments to \nthe creditor, for a total of $5,000. Applicant agreed to pay $500 a month starting on July \n1, 2023 for a total of ten months. The final payment is due on April 1, 2024. The debt is \nbeing resolved. (AE A) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: Delinquent bank loan, amount is unknown: Applicant states this is a \nloan for the business. He signed as co-signer. His lawyer is in discussions with the bank \nto arrange an achievable payment plan. I note this debt does not show up on Applicant\u2019s \ncredit reports.  Applicant disclosed this debt during his background investigation. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: Delinquent line of credit from a bank, amount is unknown: Applicant \nstates this is a line of credit for the business. He signed as co-signer. His lawyer is in \ndiscussions with the bank to arrange payment plan. I note this debt does not show up on \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports. Applicant disclosed this debt during his background \ninvestigation. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: Failure to timely file his 2019 Federal income tax return for tax year \n2019. Applicant admits he did not timely file his 2019 federal income tax return. He \ntypically files an extension because his business returns are not completed on time by his \naccountant. The business returns came back later than normal, and he did not promptly \ncomplete his personal return. Applicant and his attorney, provided proof that the 2019 \nfederal income tax return was filed.

(Item 2, Response to FORM; Item 4 at 17, \n20) \nApplicant provided a Personal Financial Statement on June 20, 2022. His total net \nmonthly income is $5,450.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns. \nThe disqualifying conditions that are relevant to Applicant\u2019s case include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nAG \u00b6 19(a) and AG \u00b6 19(c) apply to Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b and 1.c. AG \u00b6 19(f) applies to Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file and pay his \nfederal and state taxes for tax year 2019 as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies to the debts Applicant co-signed in order to keep his failing \nbusiness running. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a -1.c) The business downturn was a circumstance beyond \nhis control. Applicant hired an attorney to help him with resolving the debts of the \nbusiness. He was able to enter into a settlement agreement for the largest debt and \nintends to resolve the two remaining business debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applies to the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant and his attorney \nsuccessfully negotiated a settlement agreement regarding the largest debt on April 18, \n2023. Applicant made two $2,500 payments on April 15, 2023, and June 1, 2023. He is \nto make $500 monthly payments starting on July 1, 2023 for a period of ten months.

His budget \nand assets indicate he is capable of paying this settlement agreement. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) applies with regard to Applicant\u2019s 2019 federal and state income tax \nreturns. He provided proof that he filed his 2019 federal income tax return. He is receiving \na refund for that year. Although no documentary proof was provided, Applicant and his \nlawyer claim he filed his 2019 state income tax return. I conclude Applicant more than \nlikely filed his state income tax return for tax year 2019. \nApplicant bears the burden of production and persuasion in mitigation. He \ndemonstrated that with the help of his lawyer, he is attempting to resolve the debts related \nto his failed business. Applicant overlooked filing his federal and state income tax returns \nfor 2019 because his business returns were not completed in time by his accountant. The \nbusiness returns were provided to him later than normal and he did not promptly complete \nhis 2019 income tax returns. In a letter dated June 14, 2022, the IRS acknowledged he \nfiled his federal income tax return for 2019. It is likely he filed his state tax return for 2019 \nas well. Applicant states he is current on all of his other state and federal tax returns. Tax \nyear 2019 was an oversight on his part. He is financially capable of resolving the \nremaining debts. Applicant mitigated the concerns raised under Financial Considerations. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised \nunder financial considerations. Accordingly, Applicant has carried his burden of showing \nthat it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant him eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

She has never had a security clearance before. (GE \n1 at 6-25, 38) \nAs Applicant explained in her June 2022 PSI, she acknowledged her delinquent \ndebts, and planned to pay off the smaller delinquent accounts within the year and then \nhandle the larger accounts. She believes that she is living within her means. Before she \nlanded her current job in May 2022, she was living paycheck-to-paycheck, but she has \nalways tried to handle her own financial problems. She predicted the smaller accounts \nshould be paid within a year, whereas the larger delinquent accounts will take longer. She \nprovided documentary evidence in her December 2022 answer to the SOR of paying off \nfive unalleged debts.

Her boyfriend at the time told her that \nthey could not afford the payments and decided to have the car repossessed. The car \nwas sold at auction, leaving a deficiency balance that Applicant has not been able to pay. \n(GE 4 at 6; GE 5 at 3) The account has not been paid. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a \u2013 In April 2017, Applicant\u2019s former husband purchased a car without \nher knowledge. He furtively had her sign the paperwork as primary account holder. In May \n2017, Applicant decided to stay at home to provide day-care for her children. In the same \nmonth, her husband suddenly left her, and the car was repossessed within months \nbecause she could not afford the payments. (GE 4 at 6; GE 5 at 8) The account is \nunresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c \u2013 This is an account for delinquent rent. The account became \ndelinquent in May 2022. Before her rental lease ended, Applicant moved out of her \napartment. She agreed to pay for breaking the lease.

The accounts became delinquent between July 2021 and \nJanuary 2022. On May 11, 2023, Applicant provided documentation confirming that she \npaid the five listed medical accounts. (GE 5 at 8-9; May 2023 response to FORM at 2-3) \nThe five accounts are resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare flexible rules of law, apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14., the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15., the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision.  \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect sensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or \nexacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other trust issues \nof personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \n4 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nA security clearance holder occupies a fiduciary relationship with the Government \nthat requires compliance with all security regulations at all times and in all locations. An \nimportant way to ascertain whether an applicant possesses the requisite judgment to \nsafeguard classified information is to examine how she manages her personal matters. \nFor example, if the applicant shows irresponsibility with her financial obligations, then \nthere is a probability she may adopt the same kind of irresponsible attitude toward security \nrules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 19. The disqualifying conditions relevant in this case are: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant has ten delinquent commercial accounts totaling $21,125. Her May \n2022 e-QIP, her June 2022 PSI, the Government May 2022 CBR (Item 5), and her \nDecember 2022 answer to the SOR, establish the Government\u2019s case under the financial \nconsiderations guideline. It is well settled that negative information within credit bureau \nreports can establish allegations of debt delinquencies. See ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at \n7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010) The accounts became delinquent between December 2019 and \nMay 2022. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. Based on Applicant\u2019s documented resolution of \nten alleged and unalleged delinquent debts in the past nine months, I conclude that AG \n\u00b6 19(b) does not apply to the circumstances of this case. \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion by producing evidence that \nrebuts or mitigates the Government\u2019s case and meets her burden of demonstrating she \nwarrants eligibility for security clearance. \nAG \u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n5 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identify theft, and the \nindividual has acted responsibly under the circumstances.  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a nonprofit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAll of the mitigating conditions identified above apply to mitigate the security \nconcerns in this case. In her professional career, she encountered a significant period of \nunemployment between 2014 and 2017. Before the SOR was issued in November 2022, \nApplicant informed OPM in June 2022 of her plan to satisfy all her delinquent accounts \nby addressing the smaller bills first, then moving to the larger ones. In her December 2022 \nanswer to the SOR, she provided documentation of paying off five unalleged creditors. In \nMay 2023, she provided additional evidence of satisfying five listed medical accounts. \nThough she has provided no evidence of counseling, there are clear indications she is \nmaking a good-faith effort to repay the past-due debts. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the guideline for financial considerations in \nthe context of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n6 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________ \nI have carefully evaluated the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \ncontext of the entire record. Applicant is 34 years old and is raising two young children. In \n2012, she received a certificate and collected some college credits. She had pregnancy-\nrelated problems in 2012 followed by unemployment for a three-year period between 2014 \nand 2017. \nHowever, she has produced documentary proof of eliminating ten delinquent \ndebts in a nine-month period between June 2022 and May 2023. In Guideline F cases, \nthe DOHA Appeal Board has repeatedly held that, to establish her case in mitigation, an \napplicant must present a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt repayments that result in debt \nreduction. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007) While an \napplicant is not required to show that every debt listed in the SOR is paid, the applicant \nmust show that she has a plan aimed at debt resolution and has taken significant action \nto implement the plan. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006) \nFrom the record presented, Applicant has demonstrated that she has a plan in place and \nhas furnished documented evidence of paying off debts pursuant to that plan. After a full \nreview of the entire record from an overall common-sense point of view, Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns stemming from the guideline for financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j: \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant access to \nclassified information.

Applicant provided an undated response to the SOR (Answer). He \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nJune 20, 2023. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on September 20, 2023. At the hearing, \nI admitted Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 and Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through \nC without objection. Applicant also testified at the hearing. I left the record open after \nthe hearing to provide Applicant an opportunity to provide post-hearing documents, and \nhe timely provided AE D, which I admitted without objection. I received a transcript (Tr.) \nof the hearing on September 27, 2023. \n1 \n\nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 43-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom he has \nworked, on and off, since December 2018. He was married from July 2007 until \nSeptember 2016. He currently has a girlfriend with whom he cohabitates. He has one \n15-year-old child with whom he shares custody with his ex-wife. His girlfriend\u2019s two \nchildren also reside with him. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2015. He served on \nactive duty with the Navy from 1999 until 2007, when he earned an honorable \ndischarge. (Tr. 22-23, 28-37, 43-44, 63-64; GE 1, 4) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s 18 delinquent federal student \nloans and one delinquent tuition account totaling approximately $71,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nthrough 1.s). He denied all the SOR allegations. Despite his denials, the SOR \nallegations are established by the Government\u2019s 2021 and 2022 credit reports. (SOR; \nAnswer, GE 2, 3, AE D) \nNone of the SOR debts were being resolved prior to the hearing. Applicant and \nhis ex-wife opened these federal student loan and tuition accounts with the Department \nof Education (DOE) and the online college beginning in about 2011, to finance their \nhigher education expenses. Applicant claimed that his ex-wife took care of the family \nfinances, while he worked. He recalls signing a packet of documents that was an \napplication for student loans, but he did not look at the packet closely and cannot recall \nthe specifics, such as loan amounts. He claimed that his ex-wife led him to believe that \nshe was only borrowing money to pay for Christmas presents and to upgrade his \ngaming personal computer. However, he acknowledged that when he signed the loan \npacket, he knew he was applying for a student loan and may have authorized the full \nstudent loan and tuition balance alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 22-27, 38- 44, 58-59; GE 1-4; \nAE A, C, D) \nAppellant suspects that his ex-wife opened additional federal student loans in his \nname without his knowledge and consent. However, he provided no corroborating \nevidence to this effect. He provided printouts of a selection of text messages between \nhim and his wife over several years, but those text messages are inconclusive as to \nwhether she did so. In those text messages, he blames her for taking out the loans and \ntuition and she disagrees and claims they both applied for them. He also acknowledged \nthat the loan package he signed may have been for the full loan and tuition amount \nbecause he did not read the documents. He claimed that he and his wife both had G.I. \nBill benefits and therefore did not need to apply for student loans. However, he did not \nexplain why he agreed to apply for federal student loans that he allegedly did not need. \n(Tr. 22-27, 38-44, 58-59; GE 1-4; AE A, C, D) \nApplicant claimed that he first became aware of the full extent of his student loan \nand tuition indebtedness in about July 2015, when he happened to look at his account \ninformation online. Based upon his ex-wife\u2019s representation to him, he believed for \nsome time that she could get all the indebtedness forgiven if she received a higher \ndisability rating from Veterans Affairs (VA). He claimed that from the time repayment \nwas required until about 2016, his ex-wife deferred the federal student loans with the \n2 \n\n \n \nservice provider. She stopped these deferral requests in about 2016 when they \ndivorced. Applicant claimed they divorced because he caught her cheating on him. (Tr. \n22-25, 42-49; GE 1, 4; AE A, C, D) \nAfter Applicant and his ex-wife divorced in 2016, the deferments on the federal \nstudent loans ended, and all the SOR debts became delinquent. He began receiving \nnotices that he was late with his payments on his federal student loans. Other than \narguing with his ex-wife as to who was responsible for repayment, he took no action to \naddress the SOR debts until about February 2020. He did not attempt to negotiate her \nresponsibility for the debts as part of the divorce proceeding. He did not dispute the \ndebts with the DOE or its loan service provider. He did not dispute the debt with the \ncredit reporting agencies. He did not bring criminal charges against his ex-wife, and he \ndid not bring a civil suit against her. (Tr. 22-25, 44-58; GE 1, 4; AE C, D) \nIn about February 2020, he contacted the loan service provider for the federal \nstudent loans and arranged to automatically pay $5 per month. He made no more than \ntwo monthly payments pursuant to this agreement before, at the end of March 2020, \nPresident Biden ordered that all federal student loans were placed in a deferment status \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic, and those payments stopped. He provided no evidence \nto show that any of the SOR debts were not delinquent prior to being placed in a \ndeferment status. The Government\u2019s 2021 and 2022 credit reports show that the SOR \ndebts were in collections. Therefore, I find that Applicant\u2019s federal student loans were \ndelinquent before the COVID-19 deferment began. (Tr. 24-25, 50-58; GE 1, 4; AE B, D) \nThe COVID-19 deferment on federal student loans has ended. As Applicant\u2019s \nfederal student loans were deferred because of COVID-19, he stopped making his $5 \nmonthly payment after March 2020. He did not make any payments from then until after \nthe hearing. He does not know how much his monthly payment on his loans will be. As \nof the hearing, he had not contacted the DOE or the loan service provider to determine \nthis information. He is unsure whether he will have the available funds to pay his \nminimum monthly payment when it becomes due as he does not follow a written \nbudget. After the hearing, he made a $110 payment towards some portion of the \nstudent loans listed in the SOR. He provided no evidence that he has attempted to \nresolve the online college tuition account. He claimed that he has about $1,600 in a \nchecking account and $6,400 invested in cryptocurrency. (Tr. 24-25, 50-68, 70-71; AE \nB, D) \nWhile the federal student loans are listed as \u201cpays as agreed\u201d in one portion of \nthe Government\u2019s 2023 credit report, there is no evidence that this status is a result of \nApplicant\u2019s resolution efforts. He testified that he does not know why the credit report \nreflects that change. Moreover, the student loans are also listed as \u201cat least 120 days or \nmore than four payments past due\u201d elsewhere in that credit report. There is also no \nevidence of a favorable resolution of the tuition account. While they are not alleged in \nthe SOR, the Government\u2019s 2023 credit report reflects that he is also no more than two \npayments behind on a mortgage and an auto loan. The same credit report reflects that \nhe took out a loan for $6,000 in 2022 to go on vacation. (Tr. 56-57, 62-63; GE 5; AE B) \n3 \n\n \n \n \nThere were several reasons that Applicant was unable to pay the SOR debts. \nInitially, the cause was that he failed to keep track of his own finances and let his ex-\nwife take care of his financial obligations. While she may have made it difficult for him to \ndetermine how much money he had borrowed, he was still responsible for reading the \nloan documents he signed and for monitoring his financial accounts. He ultimately \nlearned of the total amount of his federal student loans and tuition by simply logging on \nto his online account. There is no evidence in the record to indicate that he was unable \nto make that determination any time between 2011 and 2015. (Tr. 22-25, 28-35, 37-49; \nGE 1, 4; AE A) \nOnce Applicant did his due diligence and became aware of the SOR debts in \n2015, his failure to address these accounts was caused partly by his own inaction and \npartly by a divorce, unemployment, and underemployment. He was unemployed from \nsometime in 2017 until December 2018, then worked part time for his current employer \nuntil December 2019. Beginning in December 2019, he worked full time with his current \nemployer and then another employer until the spring of 2023. Since the spring of 2023 \nhe has been back with the same employer for whom he worked beginning in December \n2018 but is only working part time. He has also worked part time as an insurance \nsalesman and a photographer. (Tr. 22-25, 28-35, 42-49, 65-70; GE 1, 4; AE D) \nApplicant submitted numerous character letters from family, friends, and co-\nworkers, some of whom were members of law enforcement or the military. All reference \nhis integrity, honesty, reliability, and strong work ethic. They also write that he is an \nexcellent father to his son and a positive role model in the community. Some note his \ndifficult relationship with his ex-wife and blame her for his financial issues. (AE A) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s federal student loans totaling about $71,000 were in default beginning \nin 2016 until the March 2020 COVID-19 deferment. A security clearance represents an \nobligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national secrets. Accordingly, \nfailure to honor other obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an \napplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. ISCR \nCase No. 14-03358 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015). While his student loans were no longer \nconsidered delinquent in March 2020 because of the COVID-19 deferment, that action \ndoes not excuse previously delinquent student loans such as these. See ISCR Case \nNo. 20-01527 at 2 (App. Bd. June 7, 2021). He also had a delinquent tuition account. \nThe above listed conditions are made applicable by these debts, thereby shifting the \nburden to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nBeginning in March 2020, Applicant\u2019s student loans were in a deferment status \nbecause of the pandemic. However, he defaulted on these loans in 2016 prior to this \ndeferment. When student loans are automatically placed in a deferment status after \nthey are in default, Applicant\u2019s past inactions are not excused in the context of security \nclearance eligibility. He did not take any action to prepare to pay his student loans when \nthe deferment period ends in October until after the hearing and acknowledged that he \nmay not have the requisite funds to make his payments. He has not provided any \nevidence of resolution efforts with respect to his tuition account. He is also behind on \n6 \n\ntwo other financial accounts not listed in the SOR. His financial issues are ongoing, and \nhe has not established a track record of financial responsibility. He has not provided \nsufficient evidence that the behavior that led to his financial issues is unlikely to recur. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquency on his federal student loans and college tuition was \ncaused by conditions both within his control and beyond his control. The existence and \ncreation of the student loan and tuition accounts was within his control because he \nsigned a student loan application without reading it and did not keep track of his own \nfinances. To the extent that these delinquencies were caused by his divorce, \nunemployment, and underemployment, for AG \u00b6 20(b) to be applicable, he must also \nprovide sufficient evidence that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. He has \nnot done so. He did not attempt to contact the DOE or the loan service provider \nbetween 2016 and February 2020. \nApplicant also did not contact either the DOE or the loan service provider to \narrange to make his payments despite the imminent end of the COVID-19 deferment \nperiod until after the hearing. There is no evidence that he ever contacted the creditor \nfor the tuition account. Despite believing that his ex-wife may have opened these \naccounts without his consent (the evidence is equivocal on this issue), he did not \ndispute the account with the creditor or the credit reporting agencies. He also has not \ntaken any legal action against his ex-wife and did not attempt to have the loans \nassigned to her during his divorce proceeding. Finally, he further indebted himself in \n2022 by taking out a $6,000 loan to go on vacation. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s 2020 attempt to address his federal student loans with a rehabilitation \nagreement and two $5 per month payments prior to the COVID-19 deferral is of some \nmitigative value under AG \u00b6 20(d). However, he did nothing to attempt to resolve these \nstudent loans prior to then and did nothing else until after the hearing. He has also not \nprovided any evidence of his attempt to resolve the college tuition debt. AG \u00b6 20(d) \nminimally applies. \nApplicant claimed that he does not believe he owes some of the SOR debts \nbecause he assumes his ex-wife opened those accounts without his consent. If true, \nthis lack of consent could be a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of these \naccounts. However, the underlying evidence of this alleged fraud is equivocal, and he \ndoes not meet his burden of persuasion to prove it. He acknowledged that he signed \nloan documents that could have constituted his authorization to open those accounts. \nHe also acknowledged that he did not read what he signed and that he did not keep \ntrack of his finances because he allowed his ex-wife to do so. \nMoreover, for AG \u00b6 20(e) to apply, Applicant must either provide documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provide evidence of actions to resolve \nthe issue. The text messages he provided did not do so because they show that he \nclaimed his ex-wife opened the student loan accounts without his consent, but she \ndenied this and claimed they both authorized the loans. Other than arguing with his ex-\nwife to no avail, he has not provided evidence of actions to resolve the issue. He did not \n7 \n\n \n \n \ndispute the account with the creditor or the credit reporting agencies. He did not provide \nevidence that he contacted the police, filed a civil suit, or raised the issue as part of his \ndivorce proceeding. Finally, while the SOR accounts no longer show being delinquent in \none portion of the Government\u2019s 2023 credit report, there is no evidence that this \nchange reflects a positive resolution of those accounts. On the contrary, he did not \nknow why they are listed as no longer being in collections. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nHe has not provided sufficient mitigating evidence. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered \nApplicant\u2019s honorable military service and his positive character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.s: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBenjamin R. Dorsey \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

On \nOctober 31, 2022, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudication Service (DCSA CAS) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guideline H.1 The CAS acted under Executive Order (Exec. \nOr.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \n1  The letterhead for the Statement of Reasons incorrectly reflects that it was sent by the Department of \nDefense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF).

On February 6, 2023, a complete copy \nof the file of relevant material (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was given an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on February 13, 2023, and submitted a \ntimely response.

(FORM Item 4) The summary was not authenticated as required by \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.20. Department Counsel informed Applicant that he was entitled to \ncomment on the accuracy of the summary; make any corrections, additions, deletions or \nupdates; or object to consideration of the summary on the ground that it was not \nauthenticated. Applicant submitted a response to the FORM but did not comment on the \naccuracy or completeness of the summary, nor did he object to it. I conclude that he \nwaived any objections to the summary. Although pro se applicants are not expected to \nact like lawyers, they are expected to take timely and reasonable steps to protect their \nrights under the Directive. ISCR Case No. 12-10810 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2016). \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a (using \nmarijuana with varying frequency from about November 2016 to about May 2022). He \nalso admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b (intending to continue to use marijuana in the \nfuture), but with an explanation. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nexplanation: \nApplicant is a 24-year-old test engineer employed by a defense contractor since \nMarch 2022. At the time he submitted his SCA, he was unmarried and lived with his \nparents. He graduated from college with a bachelor\u2019s degree in December 2021 and \nworked in various non-federal jobs until he was hired for his current position. \nWhen Applicant submitted his SCA, he answered \u201cYes\u201d to the question whether \nhe had illegally used any drugs or controlled substances within the last seven years. He \nestimated that he used marijuana from November 2016 through May 2022. He stated \nthat his use was \u201crecreational not too often from time to time.\u201d He stated that he \nintended to use marijuana in the future, explaining, \u201cI have friends who will be living in \nstates where the drug is legal for recreational use and will possibly use it while visiting.\u201d \n(FORM Item 3 at 35-36) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDuring a PSI on August 2, 2022, Applicant told an investigator that he uses \nmarijuana about once a month with his brother or with friends. He told the investigator \nthat he does not illegally purchase marijuana but that he obtains it from dispensaries in \nadjoining states where it is legal. He also told the investigator that he has not had any \ndrug counseling or treatment. (FORM Item 4 at 4) \nWhen Applicant responded to the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b, he admitted the \nallegation with the following explanation: \nI admit to 1.b of claiming to continue use of marijuana in the future during \ninitial interviews for security clearance. I would like to add that as of now I \ndo intend to stop the use of marijuana consumption. After speaking with \nsomeone more knowledgeable of the process for [obtaining a] security \nclearance I am aware that use of marijuana will affect me being granted a \nsecurity clearance. Not being granted clearance will affect my livelihood \nand the use of marijuana is not worth the overall problems it may cause in \nmy life.   \nIn the FORM, Department Counsel argued, \u201cIn his SOR Response, Applicant \nadmits his marijuana use and states that he intends to stop using marijuana. It does not \nappear as though Applicant has in fact ceased marijuana use, which is not compatible \nwith holding a clearance.\u201d Applicant responded to Department Counsel\u2019s argument as \nfollows: \nThis letter is to make a correction to the argument that I have not stopped \nuse of marijuana. My early statement of intention to stop was to never use \nmarijuana again. I have not had any association with marijuana since \nOctober 2022 and will not have any association again. If needed I can \ntake and provide a drug screening to show proof that I have ceased use. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.

The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ncommonsense decision.

This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in\nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia; and \nAG \u00b6 25(g): expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such \nmisuse. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana was recent, frequent, \nand did not happen under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is not fully established. Applicant acknowledged his drug involvement \nin his SCA, and he stated that he last used marijuana in May 2022, shortly after he was \nhired by for his current employer and before he submitted his SCA. In his response to \nthe FORM, he stated that his last association with marijuana was in October 2022, after \nhe submitted his SCA. He has not claimed that he has disassociated from drug-using \nassociates, including his brother. He has not changed or avoided the environment \nwhere he used drugs. Although he declared in his answer to the SOR and response to \nthe FORM that he will not use marijuana again, he has not provided the signed \nstatement of intent described in AG \u00b6 26(b(3). \nApplicant did not disavow his answers to drug-related questions in the SCA until \nhe received the SOR and realized that his marijuana use was an impediment to \nobtaining a clearance. It is not clear from the limited record whether he sincerely \ndecided that obtaining a clearance was more important to him than his recreational use \nof marijuana, or whether he simply readjusted his statement of intent in an attempt to \novercome the impact of his admission in the SCA. Because he requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but \nsome warrant additional comment. \nThe inconsistency between Applicant\u2019s answers in the SCA and his responses to \nthe SOR and the FORM raises doubt about his true intent. Once a concern arises \nregarding an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information, there is a strong \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \npresumption against granting eligibility.

She submitted a signed \nstatement of intent stating that the future use of illegal drugs is grounds for revocation of \nher security clearance. (Applicant Exhibit A; Tr. 26-28.) \nMitigation \nApplicant is a successful performer as shown in her initial year-end review. Her \nsupervisor states, \u201c[Applicant] has good values and a high work ethic, and she \nunderstands and adheres to company standards, conduct policies and procedures. \n[Applicant] demonstrates a great can-do attitude and drive to be a key player and bring \nmore value to the . . . team.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit B.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe security concern relating to Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse is set \nforth in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted \nin this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nI have examined the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 and especially \nconsidered the following: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana in edible form from 2010 until June 2022. She purchased \nmarijuana from state-approved stores from 2020 through 2022. She also used \nhallucinogenic mushrooms about five times from 2020 through 2021. Both of the stated \ndisqualifying conditions apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 have also been considered: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug-involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nIn my analysis, I have taken administrative notice of the Security Executive Agent \n(SecEA) \u201cClarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Individuals Eligible to Access \nClassified Information or Eligible to Hold a Sensitive Position,\u201d dated December 21, 2021. \n(Guidance.) In her Guidance, the SecEA noted the increased number of states that have \nlegalized or decriminalized the use of marijuana (including State One) and sought to \n\u201cprovide clarifying guidance.\u201d She reaffirmed SecEA\u2019s 2014 memorandum regarding the \nimportance of compliance with Federal law on the illegality of the use of marijuana by \nholders of security clearances. She provided further clarification of Federal marijuana \npolicy, writing that this policy remains relevant to security clearance adjudications \u201cbut [is] \nnot determinative.\u201d She noted that the adjudicative guidelines provided various \nopportunities for a clearance applicant to mitigate security concerns raised by his or her \npast use of marijuana. \nApplicant used marijuana in edible form over several years as a sleep aid and to \ncontrol anxiety. She only purchased and used it in State One, where such purchase and \nuse are legal under state law. She used hallucinogenic mushrooms about five times. This \nconduct was in the past and she stated convincingly that it will not be repeated. She \nthoroughly understands the consequences of any future drug use or exposure.

Paragraph 1 is found for \nApplicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has mitigated her drug \nuse. Her forthright disclosures on her e-QIP, during an interview with an OPM \ninvestigator, in DOHA interrogatories, and at her hearing minimized or eliminated the \npotential for pressure, coercion, or duress, and demonstrated her trustworthiness. \nContinuation or recurrence of substance misuse is unlikely. Overall, the record evidence \ndoes not create any doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national security \neligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nWILFORD H. ROSS \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",
