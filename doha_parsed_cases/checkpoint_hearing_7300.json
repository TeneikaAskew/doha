Finnerty, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\n\nThe Judge found in favor of Applicant regarding Guideline E.  That portion of the case is not at issue on appeal.\n1\nclearance.  On May 30, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On October 29, 2008, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Elizabeth M. Matchinski denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: (a) whether the Judge failed to consider\nrecord evidence; (b) whether the Judge\u2019s application of the Guideline H mitigating conditions is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law; and (c) whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis is\narbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.   For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s\n1\nunfavorable decision. \nA recurring theme in Applicant\u2019s brief is his assertion that the Judge either overlooked or\nignored facts in the evidentiary record when reaching her conclusions in the case.  Applicant proffers\nthis argument in the context of the Judge\u2019s application of the Guideline H mitigating factors and in\nthe context of the Judge\u2019s application of the whole-person analysis.  Some of the specific facts that\nApplicant maintains the Judge did not consider include Applicant\u2019s decision to stop attending yearly\nreunions of his college friends where marijuana was smoked, some arguably less aggrevating aspects\nof his marijuana use, such as the facts that he never became dependent upon it and his use never\naffected his work, his substantial security industry experience, his professional accomplishments,\nhis community involvement, and the testimony of Applicant\u2019s Facility Security Officer that\nApplicant is an extremely reliable individual who takes his security duties seriously.    \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that an administrative judge has considered all the record\nevidence unless he or she specifically states otherwise.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 96-0608 at 3 (App.\nBd. Aug. 28, 1997).  Also, there is no requirement that a judge discuss or cite every piece of record\nevidence in a decision.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-00305 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 12, 2003).  After a\nreview of the record and the Judge\u2019s decision, the Board concludes that Applicant has failed to\novercome the presumption that the Judge considered the entire record.\nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s arguments go to the weight the Judge assigned various portions\nof the record evidence and to the manner in which the Judge interpreted specific pieces of evidence\nwhen evaluating both the applicability of mitigating factors and when conducting a whole-person\nanalysis.  Applicant discusses evidence such as Applicant\u2019s actions during social gatherings with\ncollege friends and the pattern of Applicant\u2019s recent efforts to abstain from involvement with\nmarijuana.  The gravamen of Applicant\u2019s arguments is that the Judge\u2019s decision not to apply the\nGuideline H mitigating factors in Applicant\u2019s favor is arbitrary and capricious.  Applicant has not\ndemonstrated that the Judge has committed error.\nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\n\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with\nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3\n(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).  \nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  While citing specific Guideline H mitigating factors, the Judge reasonably\nexplained why the mitigating evidence was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.  Specifically, the Judge\u2019s concluded that, given all of the circumstances indicated by the\nrecord, Applicant\u2019s abstinence from marijuana use since October 2006 was not sufficient to\nguarantee against recurrence.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence\ncited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing\nthe record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a\nsatisfactory explanation for her decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.\nCo., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact DOHA alleged under Guideline H, drug involvement, that Applicant used marijuana approximately twice a year from June 1999 through at least October 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), including after he had been granted a secret security clearance on June 18, 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Under Guideline E, personal conduct, DOHA alleged that Applicant admitted he falsified his February 1995 security clearance application by denying any illegal drug use (SOR \u00b6 2.b). When he initially responded to the SOR, 1 Applicant admitted the Guideline H allegations and denied the Guideline E allegation. Before any evidence was introduced at the hearing, Applicant amended his answer by admitting SOR \u00b6 2.b. After considering the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 44-year-old chief executive officer (CEO), president, and chairman of the board of an imaging technologies company that he cofounded with four others in January 2003 (Ex. 1, Tr. 28, 80). As president/CEO, Applicant works directly with the 2 firm\u2019s customers, including the Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security, on understanding security threats and developing the technologies to address those threats (Tr. 28-29). He has held a security clearance at the secret level since about September 1995 (Ex. 1), with the possible exception of a brief period in 2002 3 when he was starting up his company (Tr. 51).

Sullivan, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on April 28, 2006. On May 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security\nconcerns under Guideline H and Guideline E that provided the basis for its decision to\ndeny him a security clearance. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense as of September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 21, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 12,\n2008, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\nOctober 29, 2008\n\nDOHA alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.b that Applicant admitted during an August 31, 1995, interview that he had\n1\nlied on his February 6, 1995, EPSQ. Department Counsel clarified that the concern was that Applicant had\nfalsified his February 1995 security clearance application (Tr. 13).\nApplicant testified that he has been at the company since its inception in 2002 (Tr. 28). His e-QIP\n2\nindicates he has been employed there since January 2003 (Ex. 1). Applicant later clarified that he founded\nthe company in October 2002, but that he and four others formally established the company in January 2003\n(Tr.  28-29).\nAt his hearing, Applicant testified he was granted his initial clearance in 1996 (Tr. 30, 51), although\n3\nhe gave a date of September 1995 on his e-QIP (Ex. 1). \n2\ncontinue a security clearance for him. On September 4, 2008, I scheduled a hearing for\nOctober 2, 2008. Due to scheduling issues, I moved the hearing to October 7, 2008,\nneither party having any objections.\nAt the hearing held on October 7, 2008, the government withdrew SOR \u00b6 2.a\nunder Guideline E, and submitted four exhibits (Ex. 1-4), which were entered without\nany objections. Applicant and his company\u2019s executive vice president/facility security\nofficer (FSO) testified on his behalf, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on October\n20, 2008. Applicant submitted no documents.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline H, drug involvement, that Applicant used\nmarijuana approximately twice a year from June 1999 through at least October 2006\n(SOR \u00b6 1.a), including after he had been granted a secret security clearance on June\n18, 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Under Guideline E, personal conduct, DOHA alleged that\nApplicant admitted he falsified his February 1995 security clearance application by\ndenying any illegal drug use (SOR \u00b6 2.b).  When he initially responded to the SOR,\n1\nApplicant admitted the Guideline H allegations and denied the Guideline E allegation.\nBefore any evidence was introduced at the hearing, Applicant amended his answer by\nadmitting SOR \u00b6 2.b. After considering the evidence of record, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 44-year-old chief executive officer (CEO), president, and chairman\nof the board of an imaging technologies company that he cofounded with four others in\nJanuary 2003 (Ex. 1, Tr. 28, 80).  As president/CEO, Applicant works directly with the\n2\nfirm\u2019s customers, including the Department of Defense and Department of Homeland\nSecurity, on understanding security threats and developing the technologies to address\nthose threats (Tr. 28-29). He has held a security clearance at the secret level since\nabout September 1995 (Ex. 1),  with the possible exception of a brief period in 2002\n3\nwhen he was starting up his company (Tr. 51).\nAfter graduating from high school, Applicant attended college from 1982 to 1986\n(Tr. 30). He first tried marijuana in 1982 when someone passed him a marijuana\ncigarette at a social function. Applicant continued to smoke marijuana out of enjoyment\n\nApplicant testified he went to work for the semiconductor right out of college (Tr. 30). On his February\n4\n1995 DD Form 398-2, he listed his employment with the company from March 1987 to September 1994 (Ex.\n4). It is unclear whether he had held previous employment with the company that was not reflected on the 398-\n2.\nThe form was identified in the SOR as an \u201cEPSQ.\u201d The form signed by Applicant on February 6,\n5\n1995, was a National Agency Questionnaire (Form 398-2) (see Ex. 4).\nApplicant could not recall for how long he abstained from marijuana after his August 1995 interview\n6\nother than to state that his use was \u201cvery infrequent\u201d and it was 13 years ago (Tr. 56).\n3\nabout monthly throughout college. He purchased the drug from street dealers at a cost\nof less than $50 about once or twice a year for his own consumption and also to share\nwith his friends who had provided him marijuana (Ex. 3, Tr. 62). Applicant also used\ncocaine once to twice a year while in college. The drug was provided by others (Ex. 3).\nIn December 1986, he was awarded his bachelor of science degree in physics (Ex. 1,\nTr. 30).\nAfter college, he worked as a marketing engineer with a semiconductor company\n(Tr. 30).  He continued to smoke marijuana from 1987 until spring 1994, about three to\n4\nsix times a year (Ex. 3).\nIn October 1994, Applicant went to work as director of marketing for a new\ncompany founded by his father that developed technology to detect explosive devices in\nbaggage (Ex.1, Tr. 39). Applicant executed a National Agency Questionnaire (DD Form\n398-2) on February 6, 1995.  He was asked about use or possession of any narcotic,\n5\ndepressant, stimulant, hallucinogen or cannabis, \u201ceven one-time or on an experimental\nbasis except as prescribed by a licensed physician.\u201d Applicant responded \u201cNo.\u201d He also\ndenied that he had ever been involved in the \u201cillegal purchase, manufacture, trafficking,\nproduction, or sale of any narcotic depressant, stimulant, hallucinogen, or cannabis.\u201d\n(Ex. 4, Tr. 35). Applicant feared he would not obtain a security clearance if he admitted\nto illegal drug use, and he did not want to tell his father the reason should his clearance\nbe denied (Tr. 39).\nApplicant was interviewed about his history of illegal drug use by a government\ninvestigator on August 31, 1995. Applicant discussed his involvement with marijuana\nand cocaine in college, and his continued use of marijuana until spring 1994. He\nexplained that he had stopped using marijuana because he had been prescribed\nmedication, and cocaine because he lost interest in it. Applicant denied any use of other\nillicit substances and any intention of using any illegal drug, including marijuana or\ncocaine, in the future. Applicant admitted that he had deliberately not disclosed his past\ndrug use on his security clearance application because he felt an affirmative response\nto the drug usage inquiry would prevent him from obtaining a security clearance (Ex. 5).\nApplicant was granted his secret clearance shortly thereafter (Ex. 1, Tr. 30).\nApplicant resumed his involvement with marijuana sometime after his interview.6\nHe had a roommate who smoked marijuana, and Applicant used the drug on average\n\n4\nfour to six times per year to 1999 (Tr. 54-55). Following his marriage in October 1999\n(Ex. 1), Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana was limited to once or twice yearly on average until\nOctober 2006 while socializing with friends from college. He did not purchase any\nmarijuana during that time and the drug was always provided to him by others (Ex. 1,\nEx. 2, Tr. 35, 41, 44, 54-55, 63, 68). Applicant knew that using marijuana was illegal (Tr.\n64).\nApplicant\u2019s employer was acquired in 2000, and he stayed on with the new\ncompany for the next two years as a vice president of product and business\ndevelopment (Ex. 1, Tr. 31). During that time, he and his spouse moved to their present\nresidence in January 2001 (Ex. 1, Tr. 27), and they started a family. Their first child, a\nson, was born in October 2001 (Ex. 1). They have two other children who were born in\nApril 2004 (Ex. 1) and in March 2007 (Tr. 76).\nIn June 2002, his division at work was sold to a security and detections company.\nApplicant and his new employer did not agree on plans for the company, and in August\n2002, he left its employ. That October, he started his own imaging technology business\n(Ex. 1, Ex. 2, Tr. 28-29, 61).\nApplicant\u2019s company prospered into a business that now employs about 100,\nwith about 22 of its employees holding a security clearance (Tr. 103-04). To update his\nsecurity clearance, Applicant executed an e-QIP on April 28, 2006. Applicant responded\n\u201cYes\u201d to question 24.a: \u201cSince the age of 16, or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter,\nhave you illegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine,\ncrack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.),\namphetamines, \ndepressants \n(barbiturates, \nmethaqualone, \ntranquilizers, \netc.),\nhallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs?.\u201d He also answered \u201cYes\u201d to\nquestion 24.b: \u201cHave you ever illegally used a controlled substance while employed as a\nlaw enforcement officer, prosecutor, or courtroom official; while possessing a security\nclearance; or while in a position directly and immediately affecting the public safety?.\u201d\nApplicant indicated that he used marijuana two times per year from about June 1999 to\npresent (Ex. 1, Tr. 37).\nOn April 3, 2007, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator about\nhis use of marijuana. Focusing on the preceding seven years (Tr. 58-60), Applicant\nstated that he used marijuana two times per year from June 1999 to October 2006 in\nsocial settings with a group of friends when he took two or three puffs off a marijuana\ncigarette passed to him. Applicant indicated that he had stopped using marijuana, and\nthat he did not intend any future use. He denied ever using it during work hours and\nmaintained it never hindered his ability to handle classified information (Ex. 2).\nOn one occasion in summer 2007, Applicant was offered marijuana during a\nreunion with his friends from college. One of his companions passed a joint around and\nApplicant \u201clet it pass\u201d without smoking it (Tr. 45, 66). Applicant told those friends present\nthat he could no longer use marijuana due to security clearance issues (Tr. 67). He\ndidn\u2019t think to leave while the others smoked, although he now realizes that he should\n\n5\nhave (Tr. 68-69). After that incident, Applicant resolved to avoid the situations conducive\nto marijuana use, and he did not attend a similar gathering of his college friends that\ntook place in summer 2008 (Tr. 46). Applicant denies any interest in using marijuana\n(Tr. 46). In the event Applicant finds himself in a situation where marijuana is offered or\nbeing used, he plans to walk away without participating (Tr. 47). Applicant still\nassociates with the college friends with whom he used marijuana in the past, about\nonce or twice per year individually (Tr. 77), but there is no marijuana involved in their\nvisits.\nThe company\u2019s executive vice president, who has had additional duties as the\nFSO for the last two to three years (Tr. 93), met Applicant in 1994 at a trade show (Tr.\n85). After becoming coworkers for the first time in 1996, they developed a close\nfriendship (Tr. 87). The FSO joined Applicant as a cofounder of their present company\nin January 2003 (Tr. 81). He and Applicant interact daily at work and multiple times\nduring the course of a month outside of work. He has never seen Applicant use\nmarijuana (Tr. 88, 94). He became aware that Applicant had used marijuana back in\n1995 or 1996 when he learned from Applicant that he had admitted to a government\ninvestigator that he had used marijuana. The FSO assumed Applicant had not used it\nafter that (Tr. 92) until he reviewed Applicant\u2019s e-QIP in April 2006 and noted Applicant\u2019s\ndisclosure of marijuana use since June 1999 (Tr. 92). Disappointed in Applicant, the\nFSO told Applicant that he needed \u201cto grow up,\u201d that it was a serious offense, and he\nshould never use it again. Applicant gave the FSO the impression that he understood\nthat (Tr. 104-06). Before Applicant\u2019s security clearance hearing, the FSO again\ndiscussed with him the matter of any future drug use. Applicant made it clear to him\n\u201cthat he understood the seriousness of the situation and that he was making a\ncommitment to both the company and most importantly to the U.S. government not to\never do it again.\u201d (Tr. 90-91). The FSO did not ask Applicant whether he had used\nmarijuana after he completed his e-QIP in April 2006, and Applicant did not volunteer\nthat he had used marijuana in October 2006 (Tr. 103). The FSO does not have any\nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s ability to handle classified information. Applicant has shown\nhimself to be \u201cextremely reliable\u201d and has taken his duty to protect classified information\n\u201cvery seriously\u201d (Tr. 89).\nApplicant works long hours, generally 50 to 60 hours per week. He is an inventor\nor co-inventor on several U.S. patents, and has testified before Congress about his area\nof expertise. Applicant is aware that his company has a drug policy, but he does not\nknow the specifics of it. He was not involved in formulating the policy (Tr. 50). He is\ninvolved in the parent-teacher association in his community, serves as an assistant\ncoach for his son\u2019s soccer team, and is involved with some charitable and\nentrepreneurial organizations (Tr. 34).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\n\n6\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nThe security concern for drug involvement is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \u201cUse of an illegal\ndrug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability\n\nThe government did not allege Applicant\u2019s marijuana abuse that occurred before June 1999. His\n7\nentire history is relevant to assessing the likelihood of continuation or recurrence and cannot be ignored.\n7\nand trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it raises\nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and\nregulations.\u201d Applicant, who had a history of marijuana use since college, continued to\nsmoke the drug as he pursued his career in security and explosives detection\ntechnologies. He resumed marijuana use after he had told a government investigator\nthat he did not intend to use any illegal drug in the future, and after he was granted a\nsecret clearance.  AG \u00b6 25(a) (\u201cany drug abuse\u201d) and \u00b6 25(g) (\u201cany illegal drug use after\nbeing granted a security clearance\u201d), apply.\nApplicant bears a substantial burden of demonstrating mitigation, given his\ninvolvement with marijuana spanned over 20 years.  He continued using marijuana in\n7\nviolation of his fiduciary obligations as a cleared employee. Even if Applicant was\nunaware of a specific drug policy, he knew that marijuana use was illegal (Tr. 64). AG \u00b6\n26(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) cannot reasonably be applied. He\nused marijuana in October 2006, after he had been told by his good friend, a cofounder\nof the company and its current FSO, that he had to cease his involvement. As recently\nas summer 2007, Applicant was still associating with those college friends with whom\nhe used marijuana in the past. Although he turned down the drug when it was offered to\nhim on that occasion, he did not leave the premises while his friends smoked the drug.\nBoth incidents raise considerable concerns about his judgment and reliability, and about\nhis commitment to abstain from illegal drug use in the future.\nApplicant acknowledges that he did not take his commitment to the Department\nof Defense seriously enough (Tr. 52) and that he should have left when his friends\nbegan smoking in summer 2007 (Tr. 68-69). He asserts that the situation is different\nnow, in that he has too much to lose by using illegal drugs (Tr. 65-66). Given that he\ncontinued to smoke marijuana after he started his own company, and after two of his\nthree children were born, one has to question what has changed about his personal\nsituation. Certainly the cofounders and those employees with him from the beginning\nhad every right to count on him to act in the firm\u2019s interest, which included not\njeopardizing his clearance and potential government contracts by abusing illegal drugs.\nA credible argument can be made that the importance of setting an example for his\nchildren increases as they reach school age and gain in awareness and reason. At the\nsame time, he had the responsibilities of fatherhood when he used marijuana from 2001\nto 2006, and any illegal conduct is inconsistent with those responsibilities.\nAG \u00b6 26(b) (\u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future\u201d) applies\nin part. He did not attend the gathering of his college friends this past summer (see AG\n\u00b6 26(b)(2) (\u201cchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used\u201d)). However,\nsince he continues to see his college friends on an individual basis, Applicant cannot\n\n8\nsatisfy AG \u00b6 26(b)(1) (\u201cdisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts\u201d), even\nthough there have been no drugs involved on those occasions.\nApplicant has also abstained from marijuana since October 2006. Concerning\npossible mitigation under AG \u00b6 26(b)(3) (\u201can appropriate period of abstinence\u201d), the\nDOHA Appeal Board has declined to articulate a \u201c\u2018bright-line rule\u2019\u201d for how long an\napplicant is required to abstain (see, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-03596 (App. Bd. Mar. 7,\n2008)). The duration and frequency of abuse, the circumstances of the abuse, and the\npassage of time since last involvement are all relevant considerations in determining a\nsufficient period of abstinence. The particular circumstances under which Applicant\nused marijuana since 1999 confirm that marijuana was not a big part of his life. On the\nother hand, recreational smoking appears to have been an expected activity during the\nannual to twice annual weekends with his college friends. He declined marijuana when it\nwas offered to him in summer 2007, before the SOR was issued. But he did not remove\nhimself from the situation and his companions smoked marijuana in his presence. It was\nnot until after the SOR was issued that he conformed his behavior to what is expected\nof persons with a clearance. Under the circumstances, his abstinence since October\n2006 is not sufficient to guarantee against recurrence.\nA demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs may also be shown by a \u201csigned\nstatement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation\u201d (see AG \u00b6\n26(b)(4)). Applicant testified he does not intend to use any illegal drug in the future. Yet,\nhe also signed a statement in August 1995 in which he indicated that he had no intent to\nuse any illegal drug in the future (Ex. 3), and he subsequently resumed use of\nmarijuana. His past failure to abide by his stated intent undermines his case for\nmitigation under AG \u00b6 26(b)(4) now. More is required in reform given his abuse of\nmarijuana on repeated occasions while he held a security clearance. Applicant was\ngranted his initial clearance in 1995 or 1996 after he had made the government aware\nof his earlier drug use. One would expect that Applicant would have understood the\nimportance of abstaining from illegal drugs at that point, and that he would not have to\nbe reminded by a government interview in April 2007 of the seriousness with which he\nneeded to take this commitment.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern related to the guideline for personal conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\n\n9\nWhen Applicant applied for a secret-level clearance in February 1995, he\ndeliberately denied any use of illegal drugs and did not report his abuse of marijuana\nand cocaine in college or his continuing abuse of marijuana after college. AG \u00b6 16(a)\n(\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities\u201d) applies.\nHowever, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.b, Applicant detailed his involvement with illegal\ndrugs when he was interviewed in August 1995. While Applicant\u2019s admissions at that\ntime appear to have been in response to questions from the investigator (Tr. 40), there\nis no indication that he had to be confronted with the facts. AG \u00b6 17(a) applies in\nmitigation where \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification, before being confronted with the facts.\u201d The five-month\ndelay in setting the record straight is viewed as sufficiently prompt in this case, given it\noccurred at his first opportunity. Applicant was not asked at his hearing whether he\nknew he could have contacted the government directly to correct the record.\nHis February 1995 falsification also falls under AG \u00b6 17(c) (\u201cthe offense is so\nminor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened\nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d). To be sure, falsification of\na security clearance application is a very serious offense. Applicant was placed on\nnotice when he signed his security clearance application that a knowing and willful false\nstatement could be punished by fine or imprisonment or both under Title 18, Section\n1001 of the  United States Code. However, since the initial falsification 13 years ago,\nApplicant has been candid with the government about his illegal drug abuse. In addition\nto the admissions during his August 1995 interview, he listed his marijuana use from\nJune 1999 to then present when he completed his e-QIP in April 2006. He responded\n\u201cyes\u201d as well to having illegally used a controlled substance while possessing a security\nclearance. When contacted in April 2007 to discuss his use of marijuana, Applicant\nrevealed his use of marijuana to October 2006, admitting that he had smoked the drug\nat least once after he had submitted his April 2006 e-QIP. Furthermore, at his hearing,\nhe amended his response to SOR \u00b6 2.b to admit that he had lied on his February 1995\nclearance application (see AG \u00b6 17(b) (\u201cthe individual has acknowledged the behavior\nand obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to\nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur\u201d).\nConcerns were raised at the hearing that Applicant may not have been open with\nhis FSO about his last use of marijuana because the FSO was unaware of any drug use\nby Applicant after April 2006. The FSO did not ask Applicant whether or not he used\nany illegal drugs after April 2006. Applicant\u2019s failure to inform his FSO about his October\n2006 marijuana use does not warrant a denial under Guideline E. There is no evidence\n\n10\nthat Applicant lied to the FSO, and he disclosed his October 2006 drug involvement\nduring his April 2007 interview with the government investigator.\nAs discussed under Guideline H, supra, Applicant exercised poor judgment that\nwould fall within the general concerns underlying Guideline E (see AG \u00b6 15) when he\nused marijuana while he held a security clearance, including after he had completed his\nApril 2006 security clearance application. This exercise of poor judgment was not\nalleged as raising personal conduct concerns, and therefore cannot provide an\nindependent basis for denial under Guideline E. However, it is appropriate to consider\nwhen evaluating Applicant\u2019s suitability for continued access to classified information\nunder the whole-person concept, infra.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed\nat AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nApplicant was granted a security clearance after he told a government\ninvestigator he had stopped using marijuana in 1994. As his career progressed and he\nstarted his own defense contracting company, he continued to smoke marijuana\nknowing it was illegal and in violation of his fiduciary obligations to the Department of\nDefense. The doubts about his judgment and reliability are not lessened by the\ninfrequency of his involvement, or that it occurred outside of work in circumstances not\nlikely to come to the attention of law enforcement. His disclosure of his drug use when\nhe updated his security clearance does not mitigate the drug involvement concerns. His\nuse of marijuana in October 2006 is especially troubling, because it occurred after he\nhad assured his FSO that he understood he had to stop using drugs. While he has\ntaken some steps to prevent a recurrence, most notably not putting himself in a situation\nconducive to drug use, doubts persist whether he can be counted on to fulfill his\nfiduciary obligations, including that of abiding by the law and DoD policy prohibiting\ninvolvement with illegal drugs under any circumstances.\n\n11\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the\namended SOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nWithdrawn\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

On February 29, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nfor Applicant under Guidelines F, E, and J. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006.\nSeptember 16, 2008\n\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 16, 2008 and requested a hearing\nbefore an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on May \n20, 2008. I received the case assignment on May 27, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of\nhearing on June 3, 2008, for a hearing on June 20, 2008. I convened the hearing on\nthat date. \nAt the hearing, the government offered four exhibits (Exhs 1-4) that were\nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant submitted two exhibits in addition to\nthe one attached to his answer (Exhs. A-C) which were admitted without objection. He\ntestified on his own behalf and three witnesses testified as character witnesses. DOHA\nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on June 30, 2008. I granted Applicant\u2019s\nrequest to keep the record open until August 15, 2008, to submit additional evidence. A\nset of documents (Exhs. D Items 1-14) was received August 18, 2008, and admitted in\nevidence without objection. I requested a supplemental submission that was received\non September 5, 2008, and admitted without objection (Exh. E, one page). \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 49-year-old employee of a government contractor for the\nDepartment of State. He has been employed as a program analyst since 1989. He has\nheld a top secret clearance since he began to work for the Department of State in 1989.\nThe work involves diplomatic security. \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted with explanation 14 of the 16 financial\nallegations in the SOR relating to approximately $45,000 in delinquent debts. He denied\ntwo of the financial allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e. and 1.m.). He also denied the two\nallegations under personal conduct and the single allegation under criminal conduct. \nApplicant filed his SF 86 almost three years ago in December 2005 after a\ndivorce from his second wife. All but one of his debts were from credit cards used during\nthat marriage. There was still an outstanding controversy over responsibility for jointly\nincurred debts. His initial approach was to attempt to have a division of responsibility for\nthe debts with his former wife. He continued on an unproductive course in that effort\nuntil the security clearance issues arose. \nA major reason Applicant did not take effective action to resolve the marital debt\nissues because he was pre-occupied with caring for the woman who is now his wife\nafter she received multiple injuries in an equestrian accident in July 2005 when a horse\nfell on top of her. The accident required her to have extensive hospitalization for over a\nyear to learn to walk again. In addition to causing Applicant to take proper care of other\nresponsibilities, he took extensive leave without pay and borrowed on his 401k to help\npay for her nursing care.(Tr. 50-51).\nApplicant decided this year to pay his delinquent accounts by withdrawal of\nsufficient funds from his 401k account with his former employer. The account had over\n$100,000 in it before the withdrawal. He communicated by telephone and mail with all\n\n3\nthe creditors without much success and this year wrote a formal letter to each one (Exh.\nB). He provided evidence of the withdrawal of funds from the 401k (Exh. E), and has\nnow resolved all of the debts. He has settled two of debts for slightly less than the claim\n(SOR\u00b6\u00b6 1. k. and 1.l.) and paid all others in full (Exh. D). The one remaining debt (SOR\n\u00b6 1.b.) that amounted to over half of the total delinquent debts alleged in the SOR was\ndropped by the creditor who notified Applicant and three credit reporting agencies that\nthey were unable to verify the debt and that it should be deleted (Exh. D, Item 2). He\nlearned that he did owe the two debts he denied in his answer and has paid both of\nthem. While he was late in taking care of the debts, they are all now resolved. \nWhen Applicant submitted his SF86 in 2005, he was in the midst of the divorce\nand knew there were some debts outstanding, but he was not fully aware of the extent\nof them. He was attempting to divide responsibility for joint accounts with his wife. He\ninquired of his security officer how to answer Question 28 regarding delinquent debts of\n90 and 180 days duration. He was advised he could answer \u201cyes\u201d and describe them as\nbest he could or \u201cno\u201d and then tell the investigator who would interview him about the\ndebts. He opted for the second choice and told the investigator of the debts when he\nwas asked about them. Applicant sought to find the security officer to corroborate his\nclaim relating to her advice, but she had moved to another company and could not be\nlocated.\nApplicant is highly regarded by his employer (Exh. A) and his supervisors. Three\nof his colleagues and supervisors testified for him regarding the quality of his work and\nethic (Tr. 20-40). His salary is approximately $4,500 a month and he has approximately\n$600 remaining each month after his mortgage payment of $1,600 and other bills are\npaid (Tr. 100-101). His wife recently has recovered from her accident and is now\nemployed with a monthly salary of between $1,600 and $2,000 (Tr. 119). He has no\nother financial difficulties. He has three credit cards which he regularly pays. He has\none grown son for whom he has no financial responsibility. \nApplicant served honorably in the Navy from 1982 until 1989 when he took his\npresent position. He left the service as a 3  Class Petty Officer. He joined the National\nrd\nGuard in 1993 and left in 1996 as a Specialist 4  class. \nth\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n\n4\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\n\u201cthe whole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nif the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) listing multiple prerequisites for\naccess to classified or sensitive information. \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18: \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n\n5\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated some delinquent debt and was unable to pay\nsome obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially\ndisqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. These include:\nEvidence that \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control(loss of employment, ....unexpected medical emergency, or\ndivorce), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances \u201c, or under AG\n\u00b620 (b), \u201cthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol@ under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts.@ Applicant\u2019s problems in resolving the debts arose from the divorce and was\naggravated by loss of income and pre-occupation by problems in the recovery of his\ncurrent wife. He has resolved all of the delinquent debts, either by payment, settlement,\nbeing dropped by the creditor because the debt could not be verified. He is now on\nfinancially sound footing and prepared for future contingencies. Despite delays in\nresolving the debts, he has now done so. I conclude that the mitigating conditions apply\nsince the matters have been resolved and that he acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances which he encountered. \nGuideline E Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG & 15:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, and\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout and an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information (AG \u00b6 15).\nConditions that could raise a security concern and be disqualifying include the\ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire (AG \u00b6 16 (a)). Applicant\u2019s failure to report certain\nfinancial delinquencies (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a.-n.) at Question 28 a (Delinquent debts of over 180\ndays), and at Question 28 b (Delinquent debts of over 90 days) on his SF 86, prompted\nsecurity concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct).\nThe requirement of the guideline is that the omissions be deliberately false. I\nconclude that they were not in view of the circumstances surrounding the situation that\nprevailed with Applicant in 2005. \n\n6\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in\nAG\u00b6 30:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns for an\napplicant. One of them that may be a disqualifying condition (DC) is a single serious\ncrime or multiple lesser offenses (AG \u00b6 31 (a). The allegation relates to 18 U.S.C. 1001\nwhich provides a penalty of a $10,000 fine and five years of imprisonment for falsification\nof material facts on a security clearance application. I concluded that the omissions were\nnot deliberate under the circumstances of the case. Thus, Applicant has mitigated the\nallegation. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I considered the\npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding this case.\nApplicant presented evidence of the circumstances surrounding his delinquent\ndebts, his divorce, the medical problems of his current wife, the submission of this SF 86,\nand the resolution of the debts. I found he has mitigated the security concerns arising\nfrom the financial problems and the omissions on his SF 86. His current financial\nsituation is good and the financial problems are unlikely to be repeated. There is no\npotential for pressure or exploitation and I believe he has learned from this experience.\nHis work record is steady and continuous for almost 20 years since he left two periods of\n\n7\nactive military service. He has strong recommendations from his supervisors for his\nwork, conduct, and reputation. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:  For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:  For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:  For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:  For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:  For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.:   For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.:  For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.:  For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.:   For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.:   For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k.:  For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l.:   For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n.:  For Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E: FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:  For Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.:  For Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a.:  For Applicant\nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Access to classified information is granted. \n____________________\nCHARLES D. ABLARD \nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, dated July 7, 2008, Applicant admits to all of the SOR allegations. Applicant is a 29-year-old driver employed by a Department of Defense contractor seeking a security clearance. He has worked for his current employer since 2004. He has held a security clearance since 1998. On August 25, 1998, he was briefed for Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) access on August 25, 1998. He served on active duty in the United States Air Force from January 1998 to September 2002. He separated as a Senior Airman (E-4) with an Honorable discharge. He has an associates degree.

Michael Lyles, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP), on July 27, 2006. On June 10, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline E, Personal Conduct, and Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, for Applicant. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn July 7, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on August 22, \n2008. The case was assigned to me on September 2, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on October 20, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on November 5, \n2008. The government offered Exhibits (Gov) 1 through 5, which were admitted without \nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and offered two documents which were \nmarked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \u2013 B and admitted without objection. The record \nDecember 11, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nwas held open until November 19, 2008, to allow Applicant to submit some additional \ndocuments. He timely submitted an eleven-page document which was admitted as AE \nC without objection.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on November 12, \n2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated July 7, 2008, Applicant admits to all of the SOR  \nallegations.   \n \nApplicant is a 29-year-old driver employed by a Department of Defense \ncontractor seeking a security clearance.  He has worked for his current employer since \n2004. He has held a security clearance since 1998. On August 25, 1998, he was briefed \nfor Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) access on August 25, \n1998. He served on active duty in the United States Air Force from January 1998 to \nSeptember 2002. He separated as a Senior Airman (E-4) with an Honorable discharge. \nHe has an associates degree. He is married and has two sons, ages 3 \u00bd and 1 \u00bd.  His \nwife is pregnant and is expected to deliver in March 2009. (Tr at 5-6, 31, 33, 46; Gov 1; \nGov 5 at AE A.)   \n \nOn February 24, 1998, Applicant completed a security clearance application, SF \n86, shortly after enlisting in the United States Air Force. He answered, \u201cNo\u201d in response \nto question \u201c27. Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity \u2013 Illegal Use of Drugs. \nSince the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used \nany controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, \nnarcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or \nprescription drugs?\u201d He did not disclose his prior marijuana use beginning in 1995, \ncrank in 1995, prescription medications that were not prescribed to him from 1995 to \n1997 and nitrous oxide in 1994/1995, and 1997. He admits that he deliberately withheld \ninformation about his past drug usage on the security clearance application completed \nin February 1998 because he was afraid of what would happen to him if he told the Air \nForce about his prior drug use. (Tr at 37-38.)  \n \nApplicant continued to occasionally use illegal drugs during the years he served \non active duty in the Air Force and after being granted a TS/SCI security clearance. He \nused marijuana with his childhood friends while on leave in his hometown. He used \necstasy in 1999. He used prescription medications that were not prescribed to him. On \none occasion, he and another airman used nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide is not a \ncontrolled substance. It is a legal substance which can be purchased over the counter \nbut can be abused if not used for its intended purpose. (Tr at 26, 34-35; Gov 2, section \n23(a); Gov 3; Gov 5.) \n \nOn November 9, 2001, Applicant was punished under Article 15, UCMJ, for \nviolating Article 134 of the UCMJ, Adultery. His punishment consisted of a reduction to \nthe grade of E-3, suspended until May 2002. After that time the punishment was to be \n\n \n3 \n \n \nremitted without further action unless sooner vacated. (Gov 4.) He was romantically \ninvolved with another airman who was married to another military member. She became \npregnant. Applicant believed the child was his. They eventually lived together, married \nand divorced. At some point, Applicant discovered that he was not the father of the \nchild. (Tr at 44.)  \n \nAfter separating from active duty in September 2002, Applicant was hired by a \ndefense contractor. He worked for the contractor until December 2002 when he \naccepted a job with another defense contractor. (Gov 5.) On December 17, 2002, he \nsubmitted a questionnaire for national security position. In \u201cSection 23. Your Police \nRecord,\u201d he listed a June 1997 arrest for possession of alcohol by a minor and his \nNovember 2001 Article 15 for adultery. He answered, \u201cYes,\u201d in response to \u201cSection \n23(a) Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally \nused any controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, \nhashish, \nnarcotics \n(opium, \nmorphine, \ncodeine, \nheroin, \netc.), \namphetamines, \ndepressants (barbituates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogen, or cannabis \nfor your own intended profit or that of another?\u201d He listed that he used marijuana from \nJune 1996 to December 2000 approximately 30 times, he used ecstacy in July 1999; he \nused crank on one occasion in November 1995; from 1995-1996, he used various \nprescription medications such as valium, Percocet, and yellow jackets that were not \nprescribed to him on five occasions between 1995 to 1996. (Gov 2.) \n \nThe SOR alleges, Applicant falsified his December 17, 2002, security clearance \nquestionnaire by failing to disclose the use of prescription medications not prescribed to \nhim in 1997, 1999, 2000, and 2001; and not disclosing his use of nitrous oxide in 1997, \n1998, 1999, and 2001.   \n \nApplicant summarized his history of illegal drug use during subsequent interviews \nwith investigators conducting his background investigation in August 2002 and January \n2003.  From 1994-1995, he used crank on one occasion, nitrous oxide on one occasion, \nand prescription muscle relaxants or anti-depressants on two to three occasions. He \nused marijuana on approximately 20 occasions from 1995 to 1996. He used marijuana \non five to seven occasions from 1997 to September/October 2000. He used valium and \nClonipen on approximately six occasions in 1996-1997. He used nitrous oxide on five \noccasions during 1997. He used ecstasy once in 1999. He used one Darvocet pill in \n1999. He used crank on occasion in 1994. (Gov 5.) \n \nIn 2000, his mother provided him ten Percocet tablets that were prescribed to her  \nwhen he complained of back pain. In December 2000, he and a friend each ingested \none Percocet pill with alcohol on three occasions. He took another Percocet pill for back \npain and lost the remaining Percocet pills. He gave a friend four of the Percocet pills. He \ningested five Bentyl pills that were prescribed to his mother. In the January 2003 \ninterview, he indicated he began inhaling nitrous oxide in 1995, using it on 20 occasions \nin 1997 and once in 1998, 1999 and 2001. (Gov 5.)   \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nOn March 13, 2003, Applicant was found ineligible for access to NS/CSS SCI. \nThe basis for the denial was his drug involvement while possessing a security clearance \nand his violation of the established NSA/CSS drug policies wherein \u201cimproper use of \ndrugs is strictly prohibited.\u201d (Gov 5 at 6.)  \n \nOn July 27, 2006, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP).  His current job requires him to have a SECRET \nclearance. He answered, \u201cNo,\u201d in response to Section 23(e) which asks, \u201cIn the last 7 \nyears, have you been subject to court martial or other disciplinary proceedings under \nthe Uniform Code of Military Justice? (include non-judicial, Captain\u2019s mast, etc.)\u201d He did \nnot list the Article 15 nonjudicial punishment he received in November 2001.  Applicant \nstates that he was told that he was issued a conditional Article 15 that would be \nremoved from his record after six months. He received a suspended reduction in grade \nthat could be vacated over a six month period if he committed further misconduct. He \nlisted the Article 15 nonjudicial punishment on his previous security clearance \napplication dated December 17, 2002. (Tr at 28-29, 45-46; Gov 1; Gov 2; Gov 4.)  \n \nApplicant answered \u201cNo\u201d in response to Section 26(b) on the July 27, 2006 e-QIP \napplication. The question asks, \u201cTo your knowledge, have you ever had a clearance or \naccess authorization denied, suspended, or revoked, or have you ever been debarred \nfrom government employment? (An administrative downgrade or termination of a \nsecurity clearance is not a revocation.)\u201d He did not list that his access to SCI was \ndenied on March 13, 2003. (Gov 1; Gov 5.)  \n \nApplicant answered \u201cYes\u201d in response to Section 24(a) on the July 27, 2006 e-\nQIP application. The question asks, \u201cSince the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, \nwhichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled substance, for example, \nmarijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, \nheroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants (barbituates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, \netc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs?\u201d  He listed his use of \nmarijuana once in July 2000. He did not list his marijuana use from 1999 to 2000, or his \nuse of prescription medication without a prescription in 1999, 2000, and 2001. (Gov 1.)  \n \nOn February 17, 2007, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator pertaining to \nhis security clearance background investigation. The purpose of the interview was his \nfailure to list his denial of SCI access in March 2003. He indicated that he did not \nintentionally falsify any documentation.  He stated he did not list the denial of SCI \naccess in March 2003 because he was not aware that his access was denied. He said \nthat when he was hired by his current employer in 2004, he was told that his clearance \nwas still active. He admitted using marijuana 4 - 5 times from 1998 to July 2000. He has \nnot used marijuana since July 2000. He also used prescription pain killers that were not \nprescribed to him on 3 - 4 occasions over that same period. (Gov 3.)  \n \nDuring the hearing, Applicant testified that he did not list that he was denied \naccess to SCI on July 27, 2006, security clearance questionnaire because he was trying \nto hide from it.  He thought that since his clearance was still active over the past four \n\n \n5 \n \n \nyears that his denial of his SCI access \u201csomehow maybe it got swept under the table. \nMaybe it was never really adjudicated, but just basically, I was dishonest and did not \nadmit to it. You know, I have a family, and I was scared to death. I didn\u2019t know \u2013 you \nknow, I just wasn\u2019t forthright and honest about it.\u201d (Tr. at 39-41.) He admits that he knew \nhis SCI access was denied and that he should have listed it on the security clearance \nquestionnaire.  He admits that he initially tried to \u201cdodge\u201d the issue of his denial of SCI \naccess during the February 2007 interview with the investigator conducting his \nbackground investigation by claiming that he was not aware that he was technically \ndenied the security clearance. (Tr at 42-43.)  \n \nRegarding his failure to fully disclose the extent of his drug use on his security \nclearance applications dated December 17, 2002, and July 27, 2006, Applicant admits \nthat he did not provide the full extent of his drug use. He thought that he was to cover \ndrug use that occurred within the past seven years or just did not remember the full \nextent of his illegal drug use. His failure to disclose the full extent of his drug use was \nnot intentional. (Tr at 22 - 23, 36-39; Gov 3; Answer to SOR.) \n \nIf Applicant completes future security clearance applications, he intends to \nanswer every question in its entirety and to be as truthful as possible. He no longer \nassociates with his former friends who used illegal drugs. He married in 2004. He is a \nfamily man who works full-time and takes college courses. His father-in-law is a pastor. \nHe and his wife are active in the church. (Tr at 31-33, 46.)   \n \nThe Chief Information Officer of Applicant\u2019s employer wrote a letter on his behalf. \nHe states that \u201cthe very nature of [Applicant\u2019s] position requires a commitment of \nintegrity and much responsibility due to the investment of training and multitude of \nrequirements that is required for this position.\u201d He notes that Applicant has \u201cmaintained \nreliability, flexibility with scheduling, dependability, and a solid commitment in his \nposition.\u201d  He has worked for the company for over four years without a single infraction. \nHis work and work ethic has been exemplary.  He has been rewarded with bonus \nacknowledgments and numerous raises because of his contributions. (AE C at 2-3.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law, who is also the pastor of his church, wrote that \nApplicant has been a member of the church for four years. He is an active participant. \nHe is involved in weekly bible study, the choir, and works in the children\u2019s ministry. He \nalso serves as an usher and is on the committee for campus maintenance and building \nimprovements. He has known Applicant for over 20 years.  He knows he was an \nexcellent student and athlete. He is married to his oldest daughter. He describes \nApplicant as \u201cconscientious and a hard worker\u201d and \u201cresponsible and dependable.\u201d He \nis studying to complete a bachelor of science degree. (AE C at 4.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife states that she and Applicant have been married for four years. \nHe is a wonderful father who is very devoted to his children.  He is trying to improve his \nlife by completing his education. He has about a year and half left to complete his \nbachelor\u2019s degree. They are active in their church. She requests that her husband not \nbe evaluated by the poor choices he made as a young teenager/adult but by the man he \n\n \n6 \n \n \nis today. (AE C at 7.) Two other members of Applicant\u2019s church wrote letters stating \nfavorable attributes. (AE C at 5-10.) During his military service, he received numerous \nletters of appreciation for his service. (AE A; AE B.)    \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n\n \n7 \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n \n \nThe Personal Conduct guideline lists several specific disqualifying conditions.  \nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) potentially applies with \nrespect to Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose the full extent of his illegal drug use on his \nsecurity clearance questionnaires dated February 24, 1998, December 17, 2002, and \nJuly 27, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s omission of illegal drug use on his February 24, 1998, security \nclearance questionnaire was deliberate. He admits that he deliberately withheld all \ninformation about his prior drug use because he was concerned about what action the \nAir Force would take if he disclosed it. He was on active duty at the time and apparently \naware of the Air Force policy against illegal drug use. \n \n \nAlthough Applicant did not disclose the full extent of his illegal drug use on his \nDecember 17, 2002 and July 27, 2006, security clearance applications, his omissions \nwere not material. On both applications, Applicant disclosed that he used illegal drugs. \nOn the December 2002 security clearance application, he listed marijuana use from \n1996 to December 2000, ecstasy in 1999, crank in 1995 and prescription medications \nwithout a prescription from 1995 -1996.  Subsequent interviews revealed that Applicant \nused prescription medications on various occasions from 1997-2001 and nitrous oxide \nfrom 1997 to 2001. His omission of the prescription drug use from 1997 \u2013 2001 appears \nto be the result of a faulty memory as opposed to a deliberate intent to deceive. Nitrous \noxide is not a controlled substance. Applicant was not required to list this in response to \nthe drug use question on either application because the question asks about controlled \nsubstances.  Applicant only disclosed a one-time marijuana use on his July 27, 2006 \nsecurity clearance questionnaire. He thought he had to disclose illegal drug use in the \n\n \n8 \n \n \npast 7 years. While his math may have been questionable calculating the seven year \nperiod (the seven year period would go back to 1999), his omission was not material \nconsidering his prior disclosures of his drug abuse history. I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, and 1.e for \nApplicant.    \n \n \nPC DC \u00b6 16(a) potentially applies pertaining to Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose his \nNovember 2001 Article 15 nonjudicial punishment in response to section 23(e) on his \nJuly 27, 2006 security clearance questionnaire. I find Applicant\u2019s omission was not \nintentional or material. Applicant thought that he did not have to list the Article 15 \nbecause he was told that it was a conditional Article 15 that would be removed from his \nrecords after six months. While this is not accurate, it is plausible to assume that \nApplicant misunderstood the advice given pertaining to his Article 15 since he is not well \nversed in military justice issues. (His punishment was remitted after six months not the \nArticle 15.) Regardless, Applicant listed the Article 15 on his previous security clearance \nquestionnaire in December 2002. I do not find the omission to be material because he \npreviously put the government on notice in his previous security clearance \nquestionnaire. SOR \u00b6 1.d is found for Applicant.  \n \n \nPC DC \u00b6 16(a) applies pertaining to Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose that his SCI \naccess was suspended in March 2003 in response to section 26(b) on his July 27, \n2006, security clearance application. He admits that he intentionally answered \u201cNo\u201d to \nthis question. He also admits to telling the investigator during his February 12, 2007, \nbackground investigation interview that he was never informed that his SCI access was \ndenied. He admitted at hearing that he was aware that his SCI access was denied and \nthat he should have listed it on his security clearance questionnaire.  He deliberately \nomitted this information in hopes that it had been \u201cswept under the table.\u201d  \n \n \nPC DC \u00b6 16(b) (deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority, \nor other official government representative) potentially applies with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.a \nwhich alleges Applicant falsified material facts during a February 12, 2007 background \ninvestigation interview by not disclosing the full history of his drug use.  Applicant \nthought that they were discussing illegal drug use that occurred within the past seven \nyears. The record contains no information as to what the investigator specifically asked \nApplicant during the interview. I find Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose the full extent of his \nhistory of illegal drug use was not with the intent to deceive. He previously disclosed his \nillegal drug use in previous interviews and security clearance questionnaires. I find for \nApplicant with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.a. \n  \n \nPC DC 16(c) (credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient under any other single guideline, but which when considered as a \nwhole, \nsupports \na \nwhole-person \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly \nsafeguard protected information) applies with respect to Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use \nwhile on active duty and while possessing a TS/SCI security clearance. While Applicant \n\n \n9 \n \n \nhas not used illegal drugs in over seven years, his conduct raises questions about his \njudgment, trustworthiness, and willingness to comply with rules and regulations. \n \n \nPC DC 16(e) (personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) \nengaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or \ncommunity standing) applies to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant lied about his illegal drug \nuse on his 1998 security clearance application because he was concerned what action \nthe Air Force would take if they were aware of his drug use. Despite these concerns, he \ncontinued to use illegal drugs while on active duty and while having a valid security \nclearance and access to SCI. His past conduct led to the denial of his SCI access which \nhe lied about on his most recent security clearance questionnaire. His lies and his past \nillegal drug use made him vulnerable to exploitation or manipulation.  \n \n \nI find for Applicant with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.g which alleges that he was denied \nSCI access by another governmental agency in March 2003.  This allegation essentially \npleads a fact. The underlying conduct which is the basis for the denial of SCI access is \nsufficiently addressed in other SOR allegations.   \n \n \nThe government established a prima facie case for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.f, and 1.h.  The \nburden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nthe security concerns. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.) The Directive lists several mitigating \nconditions under personal conduct. The following Personal Conduct Mitigating \nConditions (PC MC) potentially apply: \n \n \nPC MC \u00b6 17(a) (the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts) does not \napply because Applicant did not promptly disclose the omission of his prior drug use on \nhis 1998 security clearance questionnaire until after he separated from active duty. His \nsubsequent disclosure was not prompt. He also did not promptly disclose his deliberate \nomission of his March 2003 denial of SCI access on his July 27, 2006, security \nclearance questionnaire in response to section 26(b). He admits to dodging the issue \nfurther during his February 12, 2007, interview with the investigator conducting his \nbackground investigation.     \n \n \nPC MC \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment) does not apply.  While Applicant is given credit for admitting to his \ndeliberate falsifications during the hearing, questions remain about his trustworthiness \nand judgment due to his history of violating the trust placed in him when given a security \nclearance and SCI access. He lied about his drug use on his 1998 security clearance \napplication, knowing that the Air Force could potentially take action against him if they \nwere aware of the illegal drug use. He continued to use illegal drugs while on active \nduty in the military and while possessing a TS/SCI security clearance. To his credit, \nApplicant fully disclosed his illegal drug use on his 2002 security clearance \n\n \n10 \n \n \nquestionnaire which resulted in the denial of his SCI access in March 2003. But he lied \nabout the denial of his SCI access on his most recent security clearance questionnaire \nand during a February 12, 2007 background investigation interview. While Applicant \nappeared to be straight forward during the hearing, he has a pattern of deception that \ngoes back more than ten years. Questions remain about his trustworthiness and good \njudgment.  \n \n \nPC MC \u00b6 17(e) (the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress) applies. At hearing, Applicant \nadmitted to his deliberate omission of his drug use on his 1998 security clearance \nquestionnaire and his deliberate omission that he was denied SCI access on his July \n27, 2006, security clearance application.  He provided full disclosure about his past \nillegal drug use. He has taken positive steps to reduce vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation or duress. However, Applicant\u2019s full disclosure during the hearing does not \noutweigh his history of deception pertaining to his illegal drug use and his deliberate \nfalsifications on his 1998 and 2006 security clearance questionnaires.    \n \n \nNone of the other PC MCs are relevant to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. He has \nnot mitigated the concerns raised under personal conduct.  \n \n \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern raised under the criminal conduct guideline is set forth in \u00b6 \n30 of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines: \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \n \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \n \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nThere are two Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) which apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case. CC DC \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) and \nCC DC \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted) apply with respect to \nApplicant\u2019s deliberate omissions on his February 24, 1998, security clearance \nquestionnaire (SOR \u00b6 1.f) and his deliberate omission on his July 27, 2006 security \nclearance questionnaire (SOR \u00b6 1.c.) His falsification of his security clearance \napplication violates Title 18, United States Code, \u00a7 1001, a felony.  \n \nThe following Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (CC MC) potentially apply \nto Applicant\u2019s case: \n \nCC MC \u00b6 32(a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not \napply with respect to Applicant\u2019s deliberate falsifications due to his history of providing \nfalse information on his security clearance applications. The government expects \n\n \n11 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s to be truthful at all times when completing their security clearance \napplications. Applicant intentionally provided false information on his first security \nclearance application on February 24, 1998. He intentionally provided false information \non his most recent security clearance questionnaire on July 27, 2006. While he \nacknowledged his behavior at hearing, not enough time has elapsed to mitigate the \nconcerns raised due to his lack of truthfulness on his security clearance questionnaires.  \n \nCC MC \u00b6 33(d) (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not \nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive \ncommunity involvement) applies. Applicant expressed remorse about his past \nfalsifications during the hearing. He is married, has two children with another child on \nthe way. He attends college and volunteers with his church.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility at hearing is the first step towards \nrehabilitation.  The criminal conduct concerns are mitigated. \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s favorable \ndocuments received while on active duty in the Air Force. I considered his honorable \ndischarge from the Air Force, however, had the Air Force discovered his illegal drug use \nwhile he was on active duty, it is not very likely his service characterization would be \nhonorable. I considered the favorable comments by his superior at work as well as his \nwife, father-in-law and fellow church members. While he should be given credit for \naccepting responsibility at hearing for his past deliberate falsifications, he initially misled \nthe government by omitting his denial of SCI access on his most recent security \nclearance questionnaire and during a background investigation in February 2007. While \nApplicant appears to have matured, his recent admissions are not sufficient to \novercome the concerns raised by his deliberate falsifications during his most recent \nbackground investigation and considering his past history of untrustworthy behavior. \n\n \n12 \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed \nto mitigate the security concerns arising under personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2.

His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 46-year-old senior engineer working for a defense contractor.3 He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from March 1986 to July 1992. He was a member of a Special Forces unit and participated in combat operations in Panama. He achieved the rank of staff sergeant, and his service was characterized as honorable. After his discharge, he joined his state National Guard unit where he served until August 1995. While on active duty, Applicant had access to classified information at the secret level. There is no evidence that he ever compromised or caused others to compromise classified information. From August 1992 to December 1998, he attended college and received a master\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering (Item 5). He married his wife in May 1998, and they have a daughter, apparently of this marriage. Applicant failed to disclose any children in his security clearance application. However, in his response to DOHA interrogatories, he stated that one of his delinquent accounts could have been opened by his daughter.

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 20, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP).1 On November 7, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant \nto Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \n \n1  FORM Item 5. \n \nApril 14, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.2 The SOR alleges security \nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The SOR detailed reasons why \nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nhim, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be denied or revoked. \n \nOn November 19, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and \nelected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing (Item 4). A \ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated January 8, 2009, was \nprovided to him by letter dated January 13, 2009. Applicant signed the receipt for the \nDOHA transmittal letter on January 19, 2009. He was afforded a period of 30 days to file \nobjections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He failed to \nsubmit any materials, comments, or objections in response to the FORM. The case was \nassigned to me on March 24, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, 1.g-1.m, and \n1.o, with explanations. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.f, and 1.n. His admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence of \nrecord, I make the following additional findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 46-year-old senior engineer working for a defense contractor.3 He \nserved on active duty in the U.S. Army from March 1986 to July 1992. He was a \nmember of a Special Forces unit and participated in combat operations in Panama. He \nachieved the rank of staff sergeant, and his service was characterized as honorable. \nAfter his discharge, he joined his state National Guard unit where he served until August \n1995. While on active duty, Applicant had access to classified information at the secret \nlevel. There is no evidence that he ever compromised or caused others to compromise \nclassified information. \n \nFrom August 1992 to December 1998, he attended college and received a \nmaster\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering (Item 5). He married his wife in May 1998, \nand they have a daughter, apparently of this marriage. Applicant failed to disclose any \nchildren in his security clearance application. However, in his response to DOHA \ninterrogatories, he stated that one of his delinquent accounts could have been opened \nby his daughter. He disclosed no felony convictions and no use of illegal drugs in the \nlast seven years.  \n \n \n2  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006.  \n \n3  Item 5 (2006 e-QIP) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless stated otherwise. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nHis work history is summarized as follows (Item 5): he was employed form \nDecember 1998 to March 2001; unemployed from March 2001 to May 2001; he was \nemployed from May 2001 to November 2002; unemployed from November 2002 to \nJanuary 2003; and from January 2003 to the present, he has been consistently \nemployed. In August 2006, he started working for his current employer, a government \ncontractor, as a senior engineer (Item 5). Applicant provided no explanations about his \n2001 three month period of unemployment, or his 2003 two month period of \nunemployment. It is not apparent why he was unemployed or whether these periods of \nunemployment (the last one over five years ago) impacted his current financial situation. \n \nIn his October 2006, security clearance application, Applicant disclosed having \nan April 2006 unpaid judgment that had been charged off, and that he was over 90 days \ndelinquent on a secured loan. His background investigation addressed his financial \nproblems, and included the review of three sets of answers to DOHA interrogatories \n(Items 6, 7, and 8), and three credit bureau reports (CBR) from 2008 (Item 9), 2007 \n(Item 10), and 2006 (Item 11).  \n \nThe SOR alleges 15 delinquent/charged off accounts totaling approximately \n$35,945. He admitted 11 SOR allegations totaling approximately $32,749. Applicant \ndenied SOR \u00b6 1.a. He admitted, however, filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in \n1997, and that he was discharged in 1998 of approximately $20,000 of delinquent debt \n(Item 6). While in college he opened numerous credit card accounts and used them to \npay for his college education. He did not have the income to pay for his debts and \nbecame financially overextended. He filed for bankruptcy to get a fresh start (Item 6).  \n \nHe denied SOR \u00b6 1.c, because he believed it was the same debt alleged under \nSOR \u00b6 1.b (Item 4). I find SOR \u00b6 1.c alleged the same debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He \ndenied SOR \u00b6 1.f, because he believed the creditor (a power company) secured a \ngarnishment of wages against him in 2007. His evidence failed to establish that he paid \nthe debt through this garnishment of wages or otherwise. He denied SOR \u00b6 1.n (a traffic \nticket from another state), because he was told he could have the ticket dismissed if he \nshowed he was from out of state. He presented no evidence showing that either the \nticket or the debt were dismissed or paid. I find this debt unresolved. \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, and to the three DOHA interrogatories, Applicant \nexplained his financial problems were the result of his two periods of unemployment and \nhis wife and daughter opening numerous credit card accounts without his knowledge. \nSome of the alleged debts he failed to pay because either he did not receive the bill \nafter he moved, or he forgot about them.  \n \nApplicant claimed that prior to the start of his background investigation he and his \nwife had contacted some of their creditors and established payment plans. However, \nthey were not able to follow through with their payment plans. In January 2007, he again \npromised to contact his creditors to settle or resolve his delinquent debts (Item 6). In \nDecember 2007, he explained he was unable to contact his creditors because he was in \na \u201cdire\u201d financial situation as a result of a recent Internal Revenue System (IRS) audit \n\n \n4 \n \n \n(Item 7). His plans are to pay the IRS debt first before addressing any other delinquent \ndebts. As of January 2007, Applicant\u2019s gross monthly salary was $6,916, his monthly \nexpenses totaled $4,880, and after other deductions he had a monthly net remainder of \n$380 (Item 6). \n \nAccording to Applicant\u2019s June 2008 IRS monthly statement (Item 8), he owes a \ntotal of $22,695 to the IRS ($4,667 for tax year 2004, $8,957 for tax year 2005, and \n$9,071 for tax year 2006). He is paying the IRS $100 a month pursuant to a payment \nplan he established in 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.o).  \n \nIn the adjudication of his security clearance, Applicant requested the \nadministrative judge consider not only his financial problems, but also his past behavior \nand circumstances. He indicated his wife contributed to his current financial problems. \nMoreover, he asked that his patriotism, candor, and selflessness be considered in the \nsecurity clearance decision making process (Item 4). He highlighted his years of selfless \nservice to the nation while in the U.S. Army, which included a one-year tour in a combat \nzone.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                           \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d4 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).5 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the security concern is that an Applicant\u2019s failure or inability to \nlive within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor \nself-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of \nwhich can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of \nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \n \n4  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n5  \u201cThe administrative judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n6 \n \n \nIn 1997, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection and was discharged \nof \napproximately \n$20,000 \nin \nbad \ndebts. \nThereafter, \nhe \naccumulated \n12 \ndelinquent/charged off accounts totaling approximately $11,697 (not counting SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.c and 1.o), which have been outstanding for a number of years. Outside of his \npayment plan with the IRS, he presented no evidence (other than his uncorroborated \nstatement) of efforts to pay or resolve his financial obligations. He also claimed that he \nand his wife were in the process of contacting creditors to resolve his delinquent \nobligations. However, he presented no corroborating evidence to support his claim.  \n \nApplicant stated he did not have the financial means to pay his family\u2019s day-to-\nday living expenses and his IRS debt and at the same time pay his delinquent debts. \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts and, AG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations, apply in this case.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sparse favorable evidence fails to fully raise the applicability of any \nmitigating condition. His financial problems are ongoing and his evidence fails to show \nthey occurred under such circumstances that they are unlikely to recur and do not cast \ndoubt on Applicant's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) \ndoes not apply. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nApplicant presented some evidence that established circumstances beyond his \ncontrol contributing to his inability to pay his debts, i.e., he was unemployed for three \nmonths in 2001 and two months in 2003. AG \u00b6 20(b) applies, but only partially. \nApplicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to show: 1) why was he unemployed; 2) how these \ntwo periods of unemployment (the last one in 2003) affected his current financial \nsituation; 3) whether he acted responsibly and with judgment under the circumstances.  \n \n \nOther than his statements in his answers to the SOR and DOHA interrogatories, \nhe presented no evidence of effort to contact creditors, or to resolve his debts by \nentering into settlement agreements, or payment plans with any creditors, except the \nIRS. Other than the above mentioned periods of unemployment, he has been \nconsistently employed since July 2003. He presented no corroborated evidence of \nefforts to resolve any of his delinquent debts from 2003 to the day he received the \nFORM. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply because, there are no clear indications that his \nfinancial problem is being resolved or is under control. His inability to pay his debts \nshows he is financially overextended. He also failed to present any evidence that he \nreceived financial counseling, and that his financial problems are not likely to recur. The \nremaining mitigating conditions are not reasonably raised by the facts in this case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant seems to be a mature, \nwell educated man and a good father and husband. He has been successful working for \na defense contractor since August 2006. Applicant receives substantial credit for his six \n\n \n8 \n \n \nyears of service on active duty in a U.S. Army Special Forces unit and for his \nparticipation in combat operations. His honorable service shows loyalty and patriotism \nto the United States. After his release from active duty, he joined his state National \nGuard unit for four years. There is no evidence of any security violation, or that he ever \ncompromised classified information. Applicant appears to be a good, reliable and \ncompetent professional. These factors show some responsibility and mitigation. \n \nNotwithstanding Applicant\u2019s military service, security concerns remain about \nApplicant\u2019s current financial responsibility, reliability, and judgment. The sparse record \nevidence fails to convince me of Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from his financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.d - 1.n: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c and 1.o: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Those\n1\nfindings and conclusions are not at issue here.\n2\n \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a\ntrustworthiness designation.  On January 3, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR)\nadvising Applicant of the basis for that decision\u2014trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline\nF (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On May\n12, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Mary E. Henry granted Applicant\u2019s request for a\ntrustworthiness designation.  Department Counsel timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s application\nof Guideline F Mitigating Conditions (MC) 20(b)-(d) is unsupported by the record evidence and\ntherefore arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis\nis unsupported by the record evidence and therefore arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.1\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA. Facts\n \nThe Judge made the following relevant factual findings: Applicant is a 44-year-old man who\nhas been married twice and divorced twice.  Applicant attended college for several years, but did not\ngraduate.  Applicant earns $12.82 per hour; with shift differential, overtime, and various awards,\nApplicant\u2019s net pay for 2007 was $18,750.  Decision at 4.  Applicant cannot afford to live on his\nown; he lives with his niece and her family, sharing a room and paying $400 a month in rent.\nApplicant has two children aged 24 and 21 from his first marriage and a 21-year-old child\nfrom a relationship.  At one time, Applicant owed approximately $42,000 in child support\narrearages\u2013about $30,000 for the first two children and over $12,000 for the other child.  Id.  At the\ntime of the hearing, Applicant had three garnishments against his salary, totaling $627 per month.\nTwo of those are for child support arrearages, and one is for federal income tax.  Another\ngarnishment for a child support arrearage was paid off in August 2007.  Id.  The current\ngarnishments will be paid off in 2008.  Id. at 4-5.    \nAmong Applicant\u2019s other debts are deficiencies from two car repossessions, and student\nloans from his years in college.  Applicant will not be able to address the student loans and other\nobligations until after he has paid off the child support arrearages.  The debts related to the car\nrepossessions are uncollectible due to the state statute of limitations.  Id. at 5.\nApplicant enjoys his job.  He is able to perform his job well despite a hearing loss.  He is\nrated highly by his employer and has received two performance awards.  He cannot afford to live on\nhis own and will not be able to do so for some time.  \n\nThe standards for security clearance decisions and trustworthiness determinations are the same.\n2\n3\nB. Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2014\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give\ndeference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.      \nTo the extent that the Judge\u2019s factual findings are relevant to the assigned error, they will be\ndiscussed below.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nThe Appeal Board may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a\ntrustworthiness determination if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.32.3 and \u00b6 E3.1.33.3.  Once the government presents evidence raising trustworthiness concerns,\nthe burden shifts to the applicant to establish any appropriate mitigating conditions.  See Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors\ndoes not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.\nRather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as\na whole.\u201d  See ADP Case No. 05-12037 at 3 (App. Bd. May 10, 2007).  A trustworthiness\ndetermination must be guided by common sense in light of the record as a whole.   See Directive \u00b6\n2\nE2.2(c). \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ADP Case No. 06-12901 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 31,\n2003).\n\nMC 20(b) is found at Directive \u00b6 E2.20(b): \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\n3\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances[.]\u201d\nMC 20(c) is found at Directive \u00b6 E2.20(c): \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\n4\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control[.]\u201d\nMC 20(d) is found at Directive \u00b6 E2.20(d): \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\n5\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts[.]\u201d\n4\nDepartment Counsel contends that the Judge\u2019s application of Guideline F Mitigating\nConditions (MC) 20(b),  20(c),  and 20(d)  are unsupported by the record evidence and therefore\n3\n4\n5\narbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  Department Counsel\u2019s contention has merit.\nThe Judge applied MC 20(b) regarding Applicant\u2019s two voluntary car repossessions, which\noccurred after his 1998 divorce.  Prior to their divorce, Applicant and his wife co-signed each other\u2019s\ncar loan, and Applicant\u2019s wife stopped making payments on her car.  Unable to afford two car\npayments after his divorce, Applicant turned his wife\u2019s car over to the credit company in 1998.\nApplicant testified that he believed that the credit company would sell the car and he would have no\nfurther liability.  When he did not hear anything further from the credit company at that time,\nApplicant also turned the other car over to them in 1999.  Applicant learned in 2000 or 2001 that he\nstill owed balances on both cars.  Decision at 3-4; Transcript at 28-32, 73-80.  The Judge concluded\nthat the car debts as well as some rent-related debts were beyond Applicant\u2019s control.  Decision at\n7-8.  Even if it is assumed that the first voluntary repossession was a result of the divorce and\ntherefore beyond Applicant\u2019s control, there is no evidence that the second voluntary repossession\nwas beyond his control.  Applicant testified that he did not want to take a car with him when he\nmoved.  Transcript at 78-79.  Moreover, MC 20(b) also requires that an applicant act responsibly\nunder the circumstances.  Applicant did not verify that the two debts were satisfied by the sale of the\ncars.  More significantly, Applicant took no steps to resolve the two debts after he was contacted by\nthe creditor in 2000 or 2001 and has been waiting for the debts to disappear from his record due to\nthe operation of the statute of limitations.  Transcript at 30.    \nThe Judge found that MC 20(c) applied only in part.  Although Applicant had not sought\nfinancial counseling, the Judge found some mitigation in the fact that Applicant\u2019s financial situation\nis improving.  The situation is improving only to the extent that the debts which were being paid by\ngarnishment were soon to be paid in full.  Applicant has other significant debts, such as student loans\nin excess of $17,000, which he has not addressed at all. \nWith regard to MC 20(d), the Judge concluded that Applicant had \u201cinitiated a good-faith\neffort to repay creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d  It should be noted that Applicant\u2019s arrearages\nin child support payments at one time totaled over $42,000, and there is no indication that Applicant\nwas addressing those debts until involuntary garnishments were executed.  With the exception of one\nfederal and one state income tax debt, Applicant has not addressed his other overdue obligations.\nApplicant expects some of those debts to become uncollectible due to the statute of limitations.  He\n\n5\ntestified that he would make arrangements to pay the others as soon as his garnishments are paid off.\nThe Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts in the future are not a substitute\nfor a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially responsible\nmanner.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999).  Moreover, it appears that\nApplicant relies on overtime and bonuses to make ends meet even while he lives with his niece, and\nhe is not receiving any overtime at present.  The record indicates that Applicant is behind in his rent\npayments to his niece in the amount of $1,000.  Transcript at 102-103.  \nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis is unsupported by the\nrecord evidence and is therefore arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  Department Counsel\u2019s\nargument has merit.  The Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis relies in large part on the MCs she applied.\nSpecifically, the Judge again discussed Applicant\u2019s taking of responsibility in the payment of his\nchild support arrearages.  As discussed above, the arrearages at one time amounted to over $42,000.\nThere is no evidence in the record that Applicant took any action to pay child support until he was\nforced to do so by garnishment.  With the exception of the two tax debts, Applicant has taken no\naction to pay the other debts listed in the SOR.  The Judge also reiterated the circumstances\nsurrounding the voluntary repossession of the two cars.  The circumstances are discussed above,\nincluding Applicant\u2019s failure to take any steps to satisfy the resulting debts.\nAs noted above, Applicant was waiting for the two car debts to drop off his credit report due\nto the operation of the statute of limitations.  Transcript at 30.  The Judge stated that she gave \u201csome\ncredit\u201d to Applicant under her whole-person analysis for the fact that the car debt were now time-\nbarred.  Decision at 8.  The Judge\u2019s reliance on the unenforceability of those debts in analyzing\nApplicant\u2019s situation is error.  The Board has held that merely waiting for a debt to drop off a credit\nreport by the passage of time is not a factor in an applicant\u2019s favor.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-\n9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001).  Even if a delinquent debt is legally unenforceable under state\nlaw, the federal government is entitled to consider the facts and circumstances surrounding an\napplicant\u2019s conduct in incurring and failing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 01-09691 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2003).  Given the record in this case, the Judge has not\narticulated a sustainable rationale for her favorable application of the whole-person factors.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision granting Applicant a trustworthiness designation is REVERSED.  \n                 \nSigned: Jean E.

On January 3, 2008, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\ndetailing the trustworthiness concerns under Guidelines F and E for Applicant. The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R,\nPersonnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as amended (Regulation), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \nMay 12, 2008\n\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on January 10, 2008.  He answered\nthe SOR in writing on January 31, 2008, and requested a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. DOHA received the request on February 5, 2008. Department\nCounsel was prepared to proceed on February 27, 2008. The case was assigned to\nanother administrative judge on February 28, 2008, who transferred the case to me\nbecause of workload adjustments on March 4, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing\non March 19, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 9, 2008. The\ngovernment offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 5, which were admitted without objection.\nApplicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through F, which were\nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on April\n17, 2008. I held the record open until April 30, 2008, for Applicant to submit additional\nmatters.  He timely submitted Exhibits G and H. The Department Counsel responded\nwith no objections on May 8, 2008. The record closed on May 8, 2008.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nNotice\nAt the hearing, Applicant indicated he received the hearing notice more than 15\ndays before the hearing (The notice needed to be received prior to March 25, 2008.)\n(Tr. at 9.)\nMotion to Amend SOR\nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR \u00b6 1.a to reflect the correct state\nto which the debt is owed, \u00b6 1.c. by changing the amount owed from $17,095 to $7,095,\nand \u00b6 1.i to reflect the correct name of the debtor. Applicant agreed to the\namendments. (Tr. at 9-12.) At the close of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to\nagain amend the SOR to add two additional allegations based on the hearing\ntestimony:\n1.l, \u201cYou are indebted to the State of [ ] for child support in the\napproximate amount of $6,000. As of April 9, 2007, this debt has not been\nsatisfied.\u201d \nand \n1.m, \u201cYou are indebted to the Internal Revenue Service for federal taxes\nfor the tax year 2003 in the approximate amount of $330. As of April 9,\n2007 this debt has not been paid.\u201d\nApplicant did not object to the amendment and I granted it.

He denied the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 2.a of the SOR.  His discussions regarding allegations 1.l and\n1\n1.m at the hearing are treated as admissions of the debts. (Tr. 26-27.)\nApplicant, a 44-year-old man seeking a position of public trust, works as a\npatient care advocate for a Department of Defense contractor. He began this\nemployment four years ago. He completed his SF-85P in April 2004, and re-signed the\napplication in March 2005.2\nApplicant married twice and divorced twice. He currently lives with his niece and\nher family, where he shares a room, because he cannot afford to live on his own. He\nhas a son, age 24, and a daughter, age 21, from his first marriage. He also has a\ndaughter, age 21, from a relationship. He graduated from high school and attended\ncollege periodically, but did not graduate.3\nWhen his first marriage ended, the court determined, in June 1986, he should\npay his former wife child support for both children, in the amount of $35 a month per\nchild. When school ended in 1988, this amount increased to $125 a month per child\nuntil age 18.  In addition, the court in another state also determined that he should pay\nchild support for his other daughter, amount unknown. Because of limited income and\nsporadic work while a student and later, he fell into arrears on his child support. For his\ntwo children from his marriage, his arrearage reached about $30,000. His arrearage for\nhis other daughter totaled more than $12,000.4\nIn 1997, during his second marriage, he and his wife purchased a used car (a\nDodge Neon) for her use and a 1995 Chevrolet Cavalier for his use. Both signed the car\nnotes. When they separated and divorced in 1998, his wife stopped making her car\npayment. He called the note holder to find out what he could do, as he could not pay\ntwo car payments. The note holder suggested a voluntary repossession, indicating that\nit would sell the car. He believed that his outstanding debt would be resolved with the\nsale. The note holder did not tell him he would still owe money on the loan after the car\nwas sold. Had he been told this, he would have developed a different plan for selling\nthe car.5\n\nId.\n6\nGE 2 (Interrogatories and answers with attachments) at 11; AE B (Copy of pay stub); Tr. 22, 25-27, 41.\n7\nGE 2, supra note 7, at 7-9; GE 4 (Credit report, dated April 6, 2007); Tr. 24-25. \n8\nGE 2, supra note 7 at 3, 7-10; AE B, supra note 7; AE H (Earnings statements) at 1-3.\n9\n4\nIn 1999, even though he was current on his loan payment, he decided it was\ncheaper for him to use public transportation than to continue operating his car. He\nspoke with the note holder on his car about a voluntary repossession. He received the\nsame information as previously told. He did not obtain a copy of his credit report before\nvoluntarily returning his car to the note holder; thus, he did not know about the unpaid\ndebt from the voluntary repossession of his wife\u2019s car. He did not learn of this debt until\nhe started receiving letters from the creditors much later. He did not have any money to\npay the loans.6\nApplicant currently earns $12.82 an hour. His monthly income also includes\nsome pay differential hours, pay for performance awards, some overtime, and $900\nbonus. His gross income for 2007 totaled slightly over $38,000 and his net income for\nthe year totaled $18,750.  His total gross income through April 18, 2008 total $11,257,\nincluding another $900 bonus. His net income through April 18, totaled $5,454. His\nmonthly net income averages $1,050. His monthly expenses include $400 for rent,\n$301 for a car payment, $97 for car insurance, $120 for gas and $100 for food and\nmiscellaneous items. He can not afford much else, and does not have a healthy diet.7\nFor many years, Applicant\u2019s salary has been garnished for child support\narrearage. He currently has three garnishments against his salary, which total $627 a\nmonth. Applicant\u2019s girlfriend obtained a judgment for more than $12,000 for unpaid\nchild support in 2001. He paid this judgment in full in August 2007. (SOR \u00b6 1.d.) He\nreceived a $1,263 payment refund.  \n8\nIn November 2007, his received notice of additional garnishments for payment of\nchild support arrearage. He owed his former wife $2,329 and $3,536 respectively. In\n2007, he paid $776 on the first garnishment and in 2008, he has paid $1250 (through\nMay 15), leaving a current balance of $303. This debt will be paid by the end of June\n2008. Regarding the second garnishment for child support, he paid $554 in 2007 and\n$2,246 through May 15, 2008, leaving a current balance of $1,290. This debt will be\npaid by September 2008.9\nIn 2003, Applicant earned additional income from his then employer by\nperforming extra work outside work hours for which his employer issued a 1099 and did\nnot withhold any taxes. He timely filed his 2003 tax return, but did not have any funds to\npay the additional taxes he owed for these earnings. He estimates he owed between\n$2,000 and $3,000. He entered into a voluntary garnishment with the Internal Revenue\nService (IRS) to pay his outstanding taxes. As of the hearing date, he still owed IRS\n\nAE B, supra note 7; AE F (IRS monthly statement, dated March 19, 2008); AE G (Copy of state tax release,\n10\ndated June 4, 1998); Tr. 27, 50-53.\nGE 3 (Credit report, dated March 23, 2005); GE 4, supra note 8; GE 5 (Credit report, dated December 7,\n11\n2007).\nGE 1, supra note 2, at 1, 11.\n12\nGE 1, supra note 2, at 1, 11; Tr. 42-46.\n13\n5\n$190, including penalties. Based on the record evidence, this debt would be paid in full\nas of April 30, 2008. Finally, Applicant paid the back state tax bill in 1998.10\nApplicant\u2019s remaining debts listed in the SOR have not been paid. The two\nlargest debts relate to two car repossessions, which are over nine years old and barred\nfrom collection under the State Statute of Limitations. His next largest debt is for\neducation loans, which he will not be able to pay until he completes his child support\npayments. The remaining debts relate to unpaid state taxes, rent, utilities, a jay walking\nticket, and a book club. In his answers to interrogatories, Applicant stated he would pay\nthe book club debt at the end of November after paying his bills. He did not because he\nhad to buy a new tire for his car. He has no credit cards.11\nWhen Applicant completed his public trust questionnaire, he answered \u201cyes\u201d to\nthe following question:12\nQuestion 22. Your Financial Record b. \nAre you now over 180 days delinquent on any loan or\nfinancial obligation? (Include loans or obligations funded or\nguaranteed by the Federal Government)\nApplicant listed his student loan debt, but not his car repossessions and child\nsupport arrearage. His SF-85P shows an arrow pointing left and a circle next to the\nanswer, but does not contain any additional information or attachments. He did not list\nhis child support because he had been paying this debt through garnishment for 12 to\n13 years and did not think of it as a loan or financial obligation. He could not explain\nwhy he did not list the car repossessions, noting that he did not obtain a copy of his\ncredit report before completing his questionnaire. He explains his failure to list all his\ndebts as a simple misunderstanding of the information on his part.13\nApplicant enjoys his job, which he describes as the best job he has had. His\nincome is also the best he has earned. His job requires him to work on the telephone\nmuch of the day. He is able to perform his duties, despite a hearing loss. He cannot\nafford to live on his own and will not be able to do so for some time. He recently\nreceived two performance awards and commentary about his excellent performance.\n\nAE D (Performance record); Tr. 47, 93-96.\n14\n6\nHe and friends are forming a charity and he serves on the Board of Directors. He\nrecently took a trip to Florida related to this charity. His friends helped pay his costs.14\nPolicies\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d\n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for\n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the\nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to\nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See\nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence\nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness\nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service\nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel\nare afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final\nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)  \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the\nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of\nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in\nthe adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a\nfair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is\na conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable\ntrustworthiness decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\n\n7\ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nsensitive information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin\nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty\nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple\nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations\nis set out in AG & 18:  \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.\nUnder AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially\ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@\nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt over the\nlast 15 years. He has been unable to pay some obligations for a long period of time.\nThe evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a\ncloser examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate\ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the\ndisqualifying condition may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago,\nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.@ Applicant=s financial worries have been an ongoing problem for many years,\nprimarily due to low income. This mitigating condition does not apply.\nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Two of Applicant\u2019s major\ndebts are for unpaid car loans after voluntary repossession. He and his second wife\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) (stating partial credit was available under\n15\nFCMC 6 for debts being resolved through garnishment). \nA  State Court of Appeals succinctly explained the societal and judicial value of application of the statute of\n16\nlimitations:\nStatutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that they stimulate\nactivity, punish negligence and promote repose by giving security and stability to human\naffairs. The cornerstone policy consideration underlying statutes of limitations is the laudable\ngoal of law to promote and achieve finality in litigation. Significantly, statutes of limitations\nprovide potential defendants with certainty that after a set period of time, they will not be\nha[led] into court to defend time-barred claims. Moreover, limitations periods discourage\nplaintiffs from sitting on their rights.  Statutes of limitations are, indeed, fundamental to our\njudicial system.\nCarolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 (Ct. App. 2005) (internal quotation marks and\ncitations omitted).\n8\nobtained the loans during their marriage. When the marriage ended, she refused to pay\nher car loan and he could not afford to pay two car loans on his income alone. He made\na decision to return the car to the note holder after being advised that it would sell the\ncar for him. The note holder did not tell him that he would have an unpaid balance for\nwhich he would be responsible. The end of this marriage also made it difficult for him to\npay for housing on his own, which caused other unpaid debt. I find this potentially\nmitigating condition is applies to partially mitigate security concerns.\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant has not received any financial\ncounseling. Much of his debt problem remains outstanding. However, there are clear\nindications that his finances are improving. I conclude this mitigating conditions does\nnot fully apply.\nSimilarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d Applicant\u2019s\nchild support arrearage has been a long standing and substantial debt, totaling more\nthan $42,000. For the last approximately 13 years, he has paid monthly on this debt. At\nthis time, his unpaid debt totals less than $2,000. He took the initiative with the IRS to\npay the additional taxes he owed for 2003 by developing a voluntary garnishment of his\nsalary.  This debt is paid as is the 1996 state tax lien.\n15\nHe also receives some credit in the whole person analysis, infra, for the\napplication of the State\u2019s 6-year statute of limitations, which applies to the two unpaid\ndebts following the voluntary repossession of two cars in 1998 and 1999 and listed in as\nSOR debts 1.c. and 1.d, the creditors were time barred from collecting these debts See\nState Code. Ann. \u00a744-501.  Elimination of these two delinquent debts through the\n16\nstatute of limitations has ended his potential vulnerability to improper financial\ninducements related to these debts as he no longer has any legal responsibility for\nthese debts. The fact that this debt is very old and not collectible under state law is a\n\nMitigating conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(e) and 20(f) are not applicable in this case.\n17\nThe remaining disqualifying conditions, AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(b)-16(g) are not raised in this case.\n18\n9\nfactor I must consider. In addition, Applicant did not fail to make his monthly car\npayment on the Cavalier or his wife\u2019s car. Rather, when his second wife refused to pay\nher car loan, he contacted the car loan note holder about returning the car, a\nreasonable action by him. He reasonably relied upon the advice given to him by the\nnote holder and reasonably believed that his remaining debt would be resolved with the\nsale of the car. Because he received no notice of deficiency from the note holder, he\nhad no basis to know that the first voluntary repossession had left him with unpaid debt.\nThus, in 1998, he determined that he could not afford to operate his car and decided to\nfollow the note holder\u2019s advice about voluntary repossession a second time. He acted\nreasonably under the circumstances. Had he known he would still owe money on the\ncars, he would have developed a different plan to eliminate the debt. Given his income\nof $20,000 a year or less at this time, he acted rationally in managing his finances. This\nmitigating condition applies.17\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAlthough the following conduct will normally result in an unfavorable\nclearance action or administrative termination of further processing for\nclearance eligibility, this conduct is not at issue in this case:\n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate\nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a\nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or\nreleases, and cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation; and,\n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions of\ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in\nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and the\nfollowing condition may be disqualifying in this case:18\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n19\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\n10\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nThe government established that Applicant omitted material facts from his SF-\n85P when he failed tp provide a complete listing of his outstanding debts. This\ninformation is material to the evaluation of Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness to hold a security\nclearance and to his honesty. For this guideline to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission must be\ndeliberate. He denies, however, that he deliberately falsified his answer to these\nquestions. When a falsification allegation is controverted, the government has the\nburden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove\nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative\njudge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is\ndirect or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the\ntime the omission occurred.  For DC \u00b6 16 (a) to apply, the government must establish\n19\nthat Applicant\u2019s omission, concealment or falsification in his answer was deliberate.\nApplicant did not list his back due child support payments because in his view,\nhe was paying these regularly and had been for years. He reasonably concluded that\nhis child support payments were not past due.  Because he listed his education loans,\nwhich are a federal loan, his statement that he missed read the question is credible. His\nanswer reflects that he read the question as asking for any outstanding federal loans,\nnot all outstanding loans. When he read the question at the hearing, he recognized that\nit was clear in its request. He, however, could not provide further explanation for his\nfailure to list his other debts. His failure to provide an explanation for his answer is not\nenough to establish that he deliberately falsified his SF-85P despite his apparent\nknowledge of some other unpaid debts. Guideline E is found in favor of Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n11\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public\ntrust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant has significant and\nlongstanding overdue debts. (See AG \u00b6 2(a)(1). His problems first began as a young\nman, still in college and recently divorced. (See AG \u00b6 2(a)(4).) He accumulated debt\nbecause he worked at low income jobs, leaving him with an inability to meet his normal\nliving expenses and pay his child support and education costs. (See AG \u00b6 2(a)(2).)\nWhen he married a second time, Applicant\u2019s income combined with his wife\u2019s income\nprovided sufficient income to pay housing and two car payments. When the marriage\nended, he lacked funds to pay two car payments and eventually lacked income to pay\neven low housing costs. He made a decision twice to return cars to the note holder for\nsale and payment of his debt. Under his financial circumstances, his decision to return\nthe cars for sale to pay off his loans was reasonable. He made this decision without\nrealizing that he would still owe a substantial debt on cars he no longer possessed. He\ndid not purposely incur this unpaid debt. Rather, he relied upon advice from the note\nholder to his detriment. (See AG \u00b6 2(a)(6).) \nApplicant has assumed responsibility for his overdue child support. Despite his\nlow income, he has paid almost $40,000 of this debt and his nearly $3,000 tax debt. He\nstill owes his education loans and other small debts, which he will be able to begin\npaying in the future. I recognize a promise to pay in the future does not establish\nresolution. But such a promise does show he accepts his moral and legal responsibility\nto pay his creditors. I found his promise credible. His track record of paying his other\ndebts provides some corroborating evidence of his good intentions. Under the facts of\nthis case, Applicant cannot resolve these debts until his current garnishments end,\nwhich will be shortly. He has acted responsibly to his primary debts, particularly given\nhis very limited income. (See AG \u00b6 2(a)(8).) His unpaid debts are not be a source of\nimproper pressure or duress because he is a responsible individual and a man who\nlives very simply. Of course, the issue is not simply whether all his debts are paid Bit is\nwhether his financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a position\nof public trust. While some debts remain unpaid, they are insufficient to raise\ntrustworthiness concerns. Over the years, he has made adjustments in his life because\nhe lacked the resources to pay his usual and customary bills. He returned two cars\nerroneously believing this step would eliminate his debt. He now lives with family\nmembers because he does not have sufficient income to pay the rent for his own\napartment. He has made what changes he can in his lifestyle, which has resulted in\npayment of some of his debts. His income prevents him from making any more\npayments on his debts. During the last years he has acted responsibly in the\nmanagement of his finances given his very limited income. (See AG \u00b6 2(a)(1).)  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. He is a good employee,\nwho has earned several awards. The majority of his debt problems occurred more than\n10 years ago. Over the years, he has diligently paid his overdue child support, despite\n\n12\nlimited income. He has not accumulated significant unpaid debt in recent years and\nactively developed a repayment plan with the IRS. His current income leaves little\nmoney to repay additional debt. However, because his garnishments will end shortly, he\nwill have additional resources to comply with his promise to pay the debts he owes. For\nall these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising\nfrom his financial considerations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust\nposition.

Zaid, Esq. \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has mitigated the Foreign Preference and Foreign Influence security \nconcerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nOn December 14, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline C, Foreign Preference and Guideline B, Foreign Influence. The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 14, 2008, and elected to have \nthe case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On January 31, 2008, \nDepartment Counsel requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge under \u00b6 \nE3.1.7 of the Directive. The request is marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) X. The case was \nJuly 24, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nassigned to me on March 11, 2008. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on March 26, \n2008, scheduling the hearing for April 29, 2008. The case was continued at the request \nof both parties. Another Notice of Hearing was issued on April 30, 2008, and I convened \nthe hearing as scheduled on May 29, 2008. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 5, which were received without objections. Applicant testified on his own behalf, \ncalled four witnesses and submitted Exhibits (AE) A through D, which were received \nwithout objections. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until June 6, \n2008, to submit additional matters. Applicant electronically submitted two letters, which \nwere marked AE E and F, and admitted without objections. The e-mail is marked HE XI. \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on June 5, 2008.  \n \nEvidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to the country where Applicant was born (country A). Applicant \ndid not object and the request was approved. The request and the attached documents \nwere not admitted into evidence but were included in the record as HE I through IX. The \nfacts administratively noticed are set out HE IX, and will not be completely restated in \nthe Findings of Fact, below.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is in his early 50s. He was born in country A. Applicant has a Ph.D., \nawarded in country A. He worked as a scientist for country A, holding the equivalent of a \nsecurity clearance. He came to the United States with his family in the early 1990s to \nwork in research for a year and then to return to country A. He decided not to return and \nwas sponsored for a work visa by a U.S. company. He has been contacted periodically \nby former colleagues and others in country A, asking him to return. Some of the e-mails \nwere unpleasant, but none of the e-mails contained an explicit threat. He received the \nlast such e-mail in about 2003. He is married with two adult children. They all became \nU.S. citizens in 2000. He is a partner in the ownership of the defense contracting \ncompany requesting a security clearance on his behalf.1 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife was also born in country A. She is a scientist like her husband, \nbut with a different area of expertise. When they came to this country, she and her \nhusband worked very hard to assimilate into American culture. Their children went to \nAmerican schools and have become very successful. Their youngest child recently \ngraduated from college and will be pursuing a master\u2019s degree. Their eldest child has a \nmaster\u2019s degree and has worked for a major U.S. corporation for a number of years. \nTheir eldest child\u2019s spouse is a native-born U.S. citizen who works for a defense \ncontractor and holds a top secret clearance. They have an infant child (Applicant\u2019s \ngrandchild).2 The spouse wrote of Applicant becoming \u201cAmericanized\u201d: \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 83-86, 104-108, 124-125; GE 1-5 \n \n2 Tr. at 67-81; GE 4; AE A-C. \n\n \n3 \n \n[I]f you ask me if whether [Applicant] has embraced the language, shops \nlike a healthy consumer, is involved in the community, and encourages his \nchildren to be involved in local/national activities, then he is a perfect \nAmerican.3 \n \n \nApplicant visited country A about six years ago when his father passed away. His \nwife did not make the trip. This was his first trip back since he left country A, and he had \nnot seen his father since he left. His father was a career military officer, and retired at a \nhigh rank. Applicant has not formally renounced his citizenship in country A. Country A \nprovided him a visa on short notice because of the death of his father and he traveled \non his U.S. passport. When Applicant obtained the visa, he was informed that it was \nissued because of his father\u2019s death and that the next time he traveled to country A, he \nwould have to travel on a passport from that country. The other option was to formally \napply to renounce his country A citizenship. He decided it would be much simpler to \nmaintain dual citizenship and conduct any future travel to country A on their passport. \nHe renewed his country A passport after he made the trip for his father\u2019s funeral. The \nfollowing year, he traveled to country A to visit his mother and sister on the anniversary \nof his father\u2019s death, utilizing his country A passport. His wife did not make this trip \neither. Applicant had no contacts on either trip with any representatives of the \ngovernment of country A, except for the standard entry and exit customs officials. He \nalso had no contacts with any of his former colleagues. The country A passport has \nsince expired. Now that he understands the security ramifications of possessing a \nforeign passport, he does not intend to renew it or obtain another country A passport.4 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother and sister are citizens and residents of country A. His mother \nis in her mid-80s and is not in good health. She was injured about three years ago, \nrequiring hospitalization for about three weeks. Applicant did not return to country A, but \nhis wife went there to be with his mother. She has been retired for several decades. \nTwo of her siblings live in the United States. Applicant\u2019s sister is in her mid-50s. She \nhas had medical problems since birth and has never worked. His mother and sister \nvisited Applicant in the United States on several occasions before his father\u2019s death. \nApplicant would like his mother and sister to come to the U.S. to live, but at this time his \nmother is firmly settled in country A. Applicant does not provide his mother and sister \nfinancial support. His mother receives a government pension and his sister receives a \ntype of disability. He talks to them on the telephone several days a week.5 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law and mother-in-law are citizens and residents of country \nA. They are in their mid-80s and have been retired for a number of years. They receive \na government pension, but have no current direct connection to the government of \ncountry A. His wife speaks to her parents about once a week. Applicant speaks to them \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \n3 AE C. \n \n4 Tr. at 93-99, 103; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 4, 5; AE D. \n \n5 Tr. at 99-102, 111, 119-120; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 4, 5. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nmuch less frequently, on special occasions such as holidays or birthdays. His wife has \nvisited her parents in country A about five times in the last eight years. She also visited \nApplicant\u2019s mother and sister on the trips. She used her passport from country A to \nenter and exit country A, and her U.S. passport otherwise. Applicant did not go to \ncountry A with his wife on any of those occasions. Other than customs officials, she had \nno interaction with country A government officials.6  \n \n \nApplicant does not own any foreign assets. He has considerable assets in the \nU.S. He has not voted in country A since he became a U.S. citizen. He has voted in \nU.S. elections. He is willing to renounce his dual citizenship, but he has not formally \ndone so. He does not intend to return to country A. His wife is willing to travel there \nagain if necessary to assist his mother or sister.7 \n \n \nTwo very senior engineers who work for the U.S. military testified on Applicant\u2019s \nbehalf. They are working on a defense program that looks at our defense systems \nthrough the capabilities and technologies of other countries. One of the witnesses \nadmitted that there are certain systems that the U.S. just does not understand. This \nparticular program has been in effect for a number of years and utilizes \u201cworld class \nscientists\u201d from countries that have the desired technologies. Applicant is one of those \n\u201cworld class scientists.\u201d His background and expertise have provided the Department of \nDefense with information it would not otherwise obtain. The witness testified that \nApplicant \u201cis an excellent individual to help us develop these capabilities.\u201d He met the \nApplicant in about 2001, and is familiar with his work. He has met and interacted with \nApplicant periodically since then. He is very familiar with Applicant\u2019s background and \nrecommends him for a security clearance.8 \n \n \nThe second senior government engineer testified similarly. He has known \nApplicant since 2004, as a defense contractor. He and Applicant are at different \ngeographic locations, but they are in contact as often as a dozen times a week, and the \nwitness visits Applicant\u2019s location about four to six times per year. He also testified that \nApplicant\u2019s background and research provides as he stated \u201ca perspective that we didn\u2019t \nreally pursue in the United States,\u201d with \u201ctechniques that we still don\u2019t understand.\u201d He \nwould like Applicant to be able to work directly with his team on their projects. To truly \nharness Applicant\u2019s expertise and test the data, it is necessary that he have access to \nclassified data. He also recommends Applicant for a security clearance.9 \n \n \nThe manager of the U.S. Government program that is seeking to have Applicant \nwork on their classified projects was unable to attend the hearing but wrote a letter on \nApplicant\u2019s behalf. He oversees the team of \u201cworld class scientists\u201d and has known \nApplicant since 2000. He wrote that Applicant brings a unique perspective to their effort. \n                                                          \n6 Tr. at 67-81, 104; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5. \n \n7 Tr. at 112-119, 130-131; GE 5. \n \n8 Tr. at 17-32. \n \n9 Tr. at 33-43. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nHis experience and ability to apply non-traditional techniques has \u201copened [their] eyes \nto many possibilities previously ignored.\u201d He believes Applicant is a tremendous asset \nto their program, the U.S. military, and the U.S. Government.10 \n \n \nThe chief executive officer of Applicant\u2019s company testified on his behalf. He and \nApplicant are business partners. He is a retired military officer, with extensive \nexperience in intelligence. He knew Applicant even before he came to the U.S. He \ntestified that he and Applicant share the same political, ethical, and moral convictions \nand he trusts him completely. He stated that Applicant has unique insight and has the \nability to create new technology for the government\u2019s benefit. He recommended \nApplicant for a security clearance.11 \n \nCountry A \n \nThe facts pertaining to country A are set out HE IX, and will not be completely \nrestated here. It has serious human rights issues, including torture, summary \nexecutions, disappearances, arbitrary detentions, corruption, media suppression, life-\nthreatening prison conditions, and corruption in law enforcement. There is a threat of \nterrorism, including taking hostages and bombings. Country A\u2019s intelligence capability is \nsignificant and it aggressively targets the United States.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, Administrative Judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative \nJudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \n                                                          \n10 AE F. \n \n11 Tr. at 44-65. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in \nAG \u00b6 9: \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 10. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember. This includes but is not limited to: \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport; \n\n \n7 \n \n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an \nAmerican citizen. \n \nApplicant possessed and used a country A passport while a U.S. citizen. AG \u00b6 \n10(a) is applicable. The renewal of his passport from country A while a U.S. citizen \ncould raise concerns under AG \u00b6 10(b), as an action to obtain recognition of his country \nA citizenship.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate Foreign Preference security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 11. Three are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; and \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated. \n \nBecause he had not formally renounced his country A citizenship when he \nbecame a U.S. citizen, country A continued to consider Applicant a citizen of that \ncountry. As such, he was required to use a country A passport to enter that country. \nCountry A permitted Applicant to enter country A for his father\u2019s funeral using his U.S. \npassport because it was an emergency. He was informed that he would have to travel \nthere in the future with a country A passport. The alternative was to formally apply to \nrenounce his citizenship and apply for a visa. Applicant renewed his country A passport \nfor expediency and used it to travel to country A the following year. The passport is now \nexpired and Applicant does not intend to renew it or obtain another one. He is willing to \nrenounce his country A citizenship and is resigned to the fact that he may never travel \nthere again. AG \u00b6 11(a) is partially applicable. AG \u00b6\u00b6 11(b) and (e) are applicable.  \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 7: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n\n \n8 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s mother, sister, and in-laws are citizens and residents of country A. \nApplicant received e-mails from people in country A after he did not return from his trip \nto the U.S. He traveled to country A on two occasions in the last six years. Country A \nhas serious human rights issues, has been threatened by terrorism, and aggressively \ntargets the United States for intelligence. His contacts, connections, and family \nmembers in country A create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion, both through him and through his wife. It also \ncreates a potential conflict of interest. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), (b), and (d) have been raised by the \nevidence.  \n \n  \nSOR \u00b6 2.c states \u201cYour concern about your disabled sister in [country A] keeps \nyou in conflict with the needs of your employer to serve in full and on your best to the \nUnited States interests.\u201d This allegation is already embodied in SOR \u00b6 2.b, which states \n\u201cYour sister is a citizen and resident of [country A].\u201d SOR \u00b6 2.c is concluded for \nApplicant. \n \nConditions that could mitigate Foreign Influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \n\n \n9 \n \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nApplicant came to this country in the early 1990s to work for a year and then \nreturn to country A. He loved the United States and wanted his family to benefit from \neverything that it means to be American. He decided to remain in the United States, \nwhich likely caused some consternation in country A. He and his family have prospered \nhere. It is a reciprocal relationship as his family has much to offer the U.S. They all \nbecame U.S. citizens in 2000. Applicant is a loyal American and a respected scientist \nthat can provide the Department of Defense with knowledge they would not otherwise \nhave access to. His children and grandchild are firmly planted in the U.S. I expect \nApplicant to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interests. AG \u00b6 11(b) is \npartially applicable. However, because of his close foreign family ties and the nature of \nthat foreign country, I am unable to find any of the mitigating conditions to be fully \napplicable. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n10 \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.   \n      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was born in country A. He \ncame to the U.S. in the early 1990s for what was to be a one-year assignment, but he \nnever left. He traveled to country A for his father\u2019s funeral about six years ago. Because \nit was an emergency, he was given a visa and permitted to enter using his U.S. \npassport. He was told that he would have to use a country A passport in the future. He \ntraveled to country A the following year on the anniversary of his father\u2019s death. He \nused a country A passport. The passport has expired; he does not intend to renew it or \nobtain another country A passport. He is willing to renounce his dual citizenship.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, sister and parents-in-law remain in country A. I considered \nthe totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to country A. The nature of a nation\u2019s government, \nits relationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are relevant in assessing the \nlikelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country \nhas an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent \nupon the government, the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against \nthe United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism. Country A \nhas human rights issues, has been victimized by terrorism, and is known to conduct \nintelligence operations against the United States. The complicated relationship of \ncountry A to the United States places a significant, but not insurmountable burden of \npersuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his immediate family members in country A \ndo not pose a security risk. \n \nApplicant possesses unique background, experience, and knowledge. Three \nU.S. Government representatives attested to the value of Applicant\u2019s work. While \nextremely impressive, those are not relevant factors for consideration, as the Appeal \nBoard has held: \n \nThe value of an applicant\u2019s expertise to a defense contractor or military \nservice is not relevant or material to determining the applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a security clearance. An applicant\u2019s expertise is not a measure of \nwhether that applicant demonstrates the high degree of judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness that must be reposed in persons entrusted \nwith classified information.12 \n \nWhile Applicant\u2019s expertise may not be relevant, his judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness are clearly relevant. Those characteristics, as proven by Applicant\u2019s \nwitnesses, are undisputed. \n \n                                                          \n12 ISCR Case No. 06-20062 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 15, 2008) (internal citation omitted). \n\n \n11 \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother is elderly and his sister is disabled. His father-in-law and \nmother-in-law have been retired for a number of years. They all receive some form of \ncompensation from the country A government, but have no direct connection to that \ngovernment. Applicant was sincere, open, and honest at the hearing. In the unlikely \nevent that his mother, sister, in-laws, or his wife through his in-laws, were subjected to \ncoercion or duress from the country A government, I find that because of his \nuncompromising commitment to this country and his children, that Applicant would \nresolve any attempt to exert pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress in favor of the \nUnited States.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Foreign Preference and Foreign Influence security \nconcerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.f: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on August 3, 2006. On February 28, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the\nsecurity concerns that provided the basis for its action to deny her a security clearance\nand refer the matter to an administrative judge. The action was taken under Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960),\nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued as of\nSeptember 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 10, 2008. She answered\nthe SOR in writing on March 26, 2008, and requested a decision without a hearing. On\nMay 20, 2008, the government submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) consisting\nof nine exhibits (Items 1-9). DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant and\nJuly 28, 2008\n\nThe file contains only one e-QIP for review, and it was signed by Applicant on August 3, 2006 (Item 5). The\n1\ngovernment offered no explanation for the discrepancy, and did not move to amend the SOR. Furthermore,\nthe Guideline E concerns were alleged under paragraph 3. There is no paragraph 2 in the SOR and the\ngovernment did not address it in the FORM.\n2\ninstructed her to respond within 30 days of receipt. Applicant filed a response (Exhibit A)\non June 11, 2008, to which the government did not object. On June 23, 2008, the case\nwas assigned to me to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Based upon a review of the\ngovernment\u2019s FORM, including Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR allegations (Item 4) and\nher response to the FORM (Ex. A), eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owes\n12 delinquent debts totaling $26,178 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.l). Under Guideline E,\npersonal conduct, Applicant was alleged to have deliberately withheld information about\nher debt from a September 2006 e-QIP because she did not want her employer to\nbecome aware of her financial situation (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.b).  When she responded to\n1\nthe SOR, Applicant admitted owing the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, 1.f, and 1.j. She\nindicated that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e had been sold to the creditor in \u00b6 1.b, and that the\ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.g, 1.i, 1.k  and 1.l had been paid or settled. Applicant denied that\nshe deliberately falsified her e-QIP:\nI was always cognizant of the fact that the government has the capability\nto pull such reports with full details, the same as a mortgage or auto\nlenders. Listing all creditors and indebtedness was viewed as unnecessary\nby me, in addition to primarily wanting to protect the privacy of my\ninformation from fellow co-workers whom I knew could not be confided in\nto protect the confidentiality & privacy of my personal information.\n(Item 4). In the FORM, the government conceded that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h had been\nmitigated, as the credit reports confirm the debt was satisfied. After considering the\nevidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 50-year-old human resources administrator who has worked for\nher employer since June 1991 (Item 5). She was granted a DoD secret clearance in\nabout August 1986 (Item 5).\nApplicant was married from June 1981 to November 2004. She and her ex-\nhusband have two children, a son born in December 1982 and a daughter born in\nSeptember 1985. As of August 2006, both children were living with her (Item 5).\nOn August 3, 2006, Applicant completed an e-QIP on which she responded \u201cYes\u201d\nto financial delinquency questions 28.a, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you ever been over\n\nApplicant indicated in her Answer that the debt originally owed the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.e was purchased by\n2\nthe creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.b (Item 4). The evidence indicates that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b is an updated balance\nof SOR \u00b6 1.e. As of August 2006, the credit bureaus were reporting that the revolving charge held by the\ncreditor in SOR \u00b6 1.e had been charged off in December 2003 in the amount of $1,519 and transferred to\nanother lender. The high credit of the account held by the collection agency (SOR \u00b6 1.b) matches the amount\ntransferred for collection by the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.e (Item 9). Presumably, the government alleged SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.b and 1.e as separate debts due to the different account numbers but it is not unusual for a collection agency\nto assign its own account number. \n3\n180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?,\u201d and 28.b, \u201cAre you currently over 90 days\ndelinquent on any debt(s)?.\u201d She disclosed two credit card debts in the amounts of\n$1,500 (SOR \u00b6 1.h) and $3,700 (SOR \u00b6 1.f) (Item 5).\nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on August 24, 2006, revealed that Applicant owed\n$1,688 on SOR \u00b6 1.h. and $2,844 on SOR \u00b6 1.f (in collection since about December\n2001), and that she had other outstanding debts as well. A $1,519 charge off balance\n(SOR \u00b6 1.e) was placed by a creditor for collection with the agency in SOR \u00b6 1.b.  A\n2\nproperty management company had placed for collection in September 2004 $5,513 in\noutstanding rental fees (SOR \u00b6 1.c). An outstanding installment debt had been in\ncollection since June 2005 with a $4,772 balance (SOR \u00b6 1.a). She also reportedly\nowed a charged off unsecured loan debt balance of $469 as of July 2006 (not alleged),\na $155 past due balance on a credit card account closed in May 2001 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and\n1.k, same debt), a $3,474 delinquent credit card balance in collection since February\n2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.j). A charged off credit card balance of $3,281 was included on her\ncredit report, even though she was only an authorized user on the account (SOR \u00b6 1.i).\nA $99 medical debt placed in January 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.l) had been paid after collection.\nApplicant was repaying a $27,022 auto loan on time at $572 per month (Item 9).\nOn February 23, 2007, Applicant was interviewed about her unresolved credit\nissues. She expressed her belief that the $4,772 debt listed on her credit report\nvariously as a medical debt and as an installment account was actually a credit card\ndebt that she disputes. She claimed to not recognize the $1,966 collection debt (SOR \u00b6\n1.b), which she planned to dispute within 30 days, but did not dispute that the original\nlender had charged off a past due balance (SOR \u00b6 1.e). Applicant indicated she had\npaid the debt in about June 2005. She admitted she had prematurely terminated a\nrental lease (SOR \u00b6 1.c) because she could not afford to pay rent, medical bills, and\ncollege tuition for her children. She expressed an intent to contact that creditor within 30\ndays but would not be able to begin repayment before April 2008 due to other\nobligations. Applicant similarly admitted her responsibility for the credit card debts in\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.h, 1.j, but averred that she could not begin to repay them until October\n2007. Applicant indicated she would pay a $469 unsecured tuition loan balance (not\nalleged) within 30 days. Applicant denied ever having a relationship with the creditor in\nSOR \u00b6 1.i (listed as authorized user on her credit report). Applicant indicated that if the\n$155 credit card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.k) was legitimate, she would pay it. The $99 collection\ndebt (SOR \u00b6 1.l) was for dental costs denied insurance coverage but then covered.\nWhen asked why some adverse credit information had not been listed on her e-QIP,\nApplicant responded that she knew other employees in her department could have\n\nApplicant\u2019s credit report of September 2007 (Item 8), which predates the SOR, indicated that a settlement\n3\nhad been accepted on the account. Evidence of the settlement is contained in Exhibit A.\nApplicant claims the debt was paid in 2007 (Item 4), but the account was reported to have a past due balance\n4\nof $579 in collection as of July 2007 (Item 8). She provided no proof of payment.\nApplicant treated the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.k as separate delinquencies, although she provided\n5\ndocumentation with her Answer showing that they are one debt.\n4\naccess to the form. She also explained that she did not have direct knowledge of some\nof the accounts on her credit report and that others were in dispute. Applicant reported\nshe had $704 remaining each month after payment of expenses and two debts (car loan\nand personal loan). She averred that once her car was paid off in full in October 2007,\nshe could begin to address her delinquent accounts (Item 6).\nIn September 2006, a $579 past due balance was placed for collection (SOR \u00b6\n1.g). In early October 2006, the creditor collecting the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h notified\nApplicant that it would be willing to negotiate a settlement. In late February 2007,\nApplicant paid $729 to settle the $1,108.26 balance of the debt (Ex. A).  She also\n3\nsettled her son\u2019s delinquent credit card account on which she was listed as an\nauthorized user (SOR \u00b6 1.i), and she paid the tuition debt after it had been charged off\n(Items 4, 8).\nIn April 2007, the creditor collecting the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e (SOR \u00b6 1.b same\ndebt) filed suit to recover $1,364.64 plus attorney fees and costs. Applicant countered in\nMay 2007 with an offer to settle the account by paying $50 per month from mid-June\nthrough December 2007, and then 70% of the remaining balance in January 2008. (Item\n7). The available record does not reflect any payments.\nOn September 17, 2007, the government checked Applicant\u2019s credit which\nshowed no progress toward resolving the debts in SOR \u00b6 1.a (liability being disputed\nwith the credit bureau), \u00b6 1.b (\u00b6 1.e same debt), \u00b6 1.c, \u00b6 1.d (\u00b6 1.k same debt), \u00b6 1.f,\nand 1.g  (Item 8). She had paid the unsecured tuition loan after it had been charged off\n4\n(not alleged). In response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant indicated in late October\n2007 that she had not heard anything in response to her counteroffer to settle the\n$1,364 balance of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b. She also admitted she had not yet paid the\ndebts in SOR \u00b6 1.c, \u00b6 1.d,  and \u00b6 1.f because she had helped her son and her daughter\n5\npay off some of their debts, but she would pay on her debts in 2008. Applicant added\nthat the assignee in SOR \u00b6 1.a had failed to send a representative to a court-ordered\nmediation session scheduled for October 2, 2007, and that the assignee had asked for\na settlement agreement (Item 7).\nIn November 2007, Applicant took out a new auto loan for $28,431. As of late\nFebruary 2008, she was making her payments according to terms. Applicant paid the\n\nApplicant provided documentation showing that the assignee was collecting for the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.k. The\n6\noriginal account number provided on the documentation proving satisfaction matches the account number for\nthe original creditor as reflected on the August 2006 credit report (Item 9). \nThe $18,606. 64 in total debt is based on the following debt balances: $4,773 on SOR \u00b6 1.a, $1,364.64 on\n7\nSOR \u00b6 1.b, $5,513 on SOR \u00b6 1.c, $3,263 on SOR \u00b6 1.f as reflected on her February 2008 credit report (Ex.\nA), $579 on SOR \u00b6 1.g, and $3,474 on SOR \u00b6 1.j. W hile the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j had been removed from her\ncredit record (Ex. A), there is no indication it has been paid or otherwise settled for less than the full balance.\n5\ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.d (SOR \u00b6 1.k same debt) in January 2008 (Item 4, Ex. A).  As of June\n6\n2008, she still owed about $18,606.64 in delinquent debt.7\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\n\n6\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG & 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquency since about December 2001,\nwhen one lender (SOR \u00b6 1.f) placed a $2,844 past due balance for collection. However,\nthe majority of her debts were charged off and/or placed for collection over the 2003/05\ntime frame. While she has satisfied or settled for less than the full balance those debts\nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d (1.k same debt), 1.h, 1.i, and 1.l, she still owes more than $18,000 in\ndelinquent debt. Significant security concerns are raised by \u201cinability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(a)) and by \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d (AG \u00b6\n19(c)).\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are too recent to satisfy mitigating condition AG \u00b6\n20(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d). When she completed her e-QIP\nin August 2006, Applicant reported two delinquent credit card obligations, but indicated\nshe did not know the account numbers. This failure to remain attentive to her personal\nfinancial obligations raises concerns about her judgment.\nMitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(d) (\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d) is implicated because of the recent\nresolutions of those delinquencies in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d (1.k same debt), 1.h, and 1.i. The $99\nmedical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.l had been paid after collection in or before February 2002.\nApplicant indicates she paid off her son\u2019s credit card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.i) in 2007. While it is\n\n7\nnot clear whether she paid the entire $3,281 balance or something less to settle, it has\nbeen removed from her credit report. She paid $729 to settle the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h.\nWith only about a quarter of her total delinquent debt resolved, she remains\nunder a significant debt burden. The Directive does not require that she be debt free,\nbut there are no clear indications that her remaining debt is likely to be resolved in the\nnear future. Her evidence falls short of satisfying AG \u00b6 20(c) (\u201cthe person has received\nor is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the\nproblem is being resolved or is under control\u201d). In October 2007, she indicated that her\nfinancial situation would allow her to pay all her debts in 2008 (\u201cI helped my son and\ndaughter pay off some debts this year that set me back a few months. But I\u2019m going to\nbe ok in \u201808, everything will be paid.\u201d Item 6). The evidence of record shows she has\npaid only $192 toward her delinquent debt in 2008. She reported a monthly disposable\nincome of $704 as of late February 2007 (Item 6), and there is no indication that her\nexpenses have appreciated significantly or that her income has decreased since then.\nApplicant did not present evidence that could reasonably justify her failure to make\npayments since January 2008 on her remaining delinquency.\nThe limited financial information available shows that Applicant took on a new car\nloan of $28,431 (Item 4) in November 2007. The terms of her new loan are not available\nfor review, but it is difficult to see how she is better off financially by the new loan. Even\nif her monthly payments are lower than the $572 per month she had been paying on a\ncar loan taken out in 2001, she now has a sizeable debt that has to be repaid. By\nAugust 2007, Applicant had only $6,424 left to pay on her old car loan of $27,022.\nApplicant also indicated in response to the FORM that since the start of her background\ninvestigation, she has increased her assets by more than $200,000 (Ex. A). She\nprovided no explanation as to the nature of the assets, so it cannot be determined\nwhether they are a potential source for repaying her old debts.\nApplicant attributes her credit problems to her divorce and to her son\u2019s mental\nillness (Item 4). Applicant did not provide any detail showing the extent to which her\ndivorce or her son\u2019s mental health issues impacted her financial situation. Since most of\nher delinquent debts coincide with the dissolution of her marriage, there is a basis to\nconsider AG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d). However, AG \u00b6 20(b) requires that\nApplicant act responsibly once she is in a position to rectify her financial situation. The\nevidence of record suggests an unacceptable tendency to put her self-interest ahead of\nher obligations to her creditors.\n\n8\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe government alleges that Applicant was not fully forthcoming about her\ndelinquencies on an e-QIP completed on September 1, 2006 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.b). The\nonly e-QIP of record is dated August 3, 2006. The government made no effort to amend\nthe SOR to conform to its own evidence or to explain the variation in date, but Applicant\ndoes not deny that she failed to list all of her delinquent accounts on her security\nclearance application. However, since she disputes knowing and intentional\nconcealment, the burden is on the government to prove the intent required under AG\n16(a) (\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to\nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities\u201d).\nOn the e-QIP submitted as Item 5 of the FORM, Applicant responded \u201cYes\u201d to\nquestions 28.a (over 180 days delinquent in the last seven years) and 28.b (currently\nover 90 days delinquent), and she listed the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.h. While she\ncited her concern over coworkers becoming knowledgeable about her personal financial\nsituation, she also expressed her belief that the government could obtain the full details\nabout her debts (Item 4). When asked in February 2007 about her failure to include all\nof her debts on her e-QIP, Applicant responded that some of her coworkers could have\naccess to her security form. In addition to wanting to protect her privacy, Applicant\nadded that she was not fully aware of what was on her credit report. Concerning the\ndebts listed on her August 2006 credit report, Applicant disputed the debts in SOR \u00b6 1.a\nand \u00b6 1.l, did not recognize the assignee in SOR \u00b6 1.b or the creditor holding the debt in\nSOR \u00b6 1.k, and the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i was not in her name. She was able to provide\nsome detail about her breaking her apartment lease (SOR \u00b6 1.c) and about the furniture\npurchases that led to the credit card debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j. While neither of those two debts\nwas listed on her e-QIP, I am persuaded that she lacked the intent to conceal or to\ndeceive the government. By listing two substantial credit card delinquencies, she placed\nthe government on notice that she was behind on some debts. She believed that the\ngovernment would obtain her credit record, and that some coworkers could access her\ne-QIP. Applicant\u2019s explanations for the omissions have been consistent and are\naccepted as credible. AG \u00b6 16(a) does not apply. The intent underlying AG \u00b616(a) is\nabsent in this case.\n\n9\nPersonal conduct issues related to vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or\nduress as set out in AG \u00b6 16(e) (\u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information about\none\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such\nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal,\nprofessional or community standing\u201d) must also be considered. Applicant cited her\ndesire to keep the details of her personal financial situation from her coworkers as a\nprimary basis for her not listing some known debts on her e-QIP. In response to DOHA\ninterrogatories in October 2007, she added:\nI am requesting you to keep all info I provide here strictly confidential and\nthese details are not to be provided to my employer. I didn\u2019t ask for this\nclearance. My employer wants me to get it (Item 7).\nApplicant has a reasonable expectation of personal privacy about her finances. Her\nrequest that the government respect the confidentiality of her financial information does\nnot raise concerns of heightened vulnerability where she has credibly denied she would\never allow herself to be pressured, blackmailed, or coerced because of her finances\n(see Item 6).\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding this case. The government must be assured that those\npersons with classified access can be counted on to exercise good judgment at all\ntimes. Applicant has not concealed from the government that she has had difficulty\nmeeting her financial obligations, but her handling of her financial matters continues to\nraise significant security concerns. Applicant remains under a significant debt burden\nthat she had promised would be paid in 2008. She indicated in February 2007 that she\n\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.e pertain to the same debt, so SOR \u00b6 1.e does not represent additional delinquency.\n8\nHowever, a finding is entered against her because the debt is in collection as set forth in SOR \u00b6 1.b.\n10\nwould have funds available after her car loan was paid in full in October 2007, but she\nthen took out a new car loan in November 2007. She has not presented any evidence of\nrecent payments from which I could conclude that her debt is likely to be resolved in the\nnear future.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant8\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\n                                       \n________________________\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On \nJuly 24, 2008, I was assigned the case. On July 24, 2008, DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing scheduling the hearing held on August 12, 2008. The government offered \nExhibits (Ex.) 1 through 3, which were admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on his \nown behalf and submitted Exhibits A through F, which were admitted into evidence. On \nAugust 19, 2008, the transcript (Tr.) was received.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in the SOR. \nApplicant is a 54-year-old teacher and part-time copier who has been self employed \nsince 1998, and is seeking to maintain a security clearance he has held since 1991. (Tr. \n41) An individual who works for Applicant states Applicant is a wonderful person who \ntreats everyone with respect and is a devoted husband and father. (Ex. E) A friend and \nacquaintance states Applicant is a man of strong faith who recognizes and has dealt \nwith his past mistakes, is sorry for them, and works diligently to lead a good life. A co-\nworker states Applicant is a responsible person who arrives early and leaves late to \ninsure all requirements are completed. He is a wonderful and patient teacher. Another \nco-worker states Applicant is a terrific co-worker, considerate friend, an ideal confidante, \ndiligent worker, and very good at his job. He is also a dedicated and loving husband and \nfather. (Ex. E)  \n \n \nApplicant has been married for 32 years. (Tr. 32) He has four children: a \ndaughter 30, and three sons ages 29, 27, and 20. (Tr. 33) Applicant grew up in the \nprinting business. His father was a newspaper foreman and in high school, Applicant \nstarted working in printing. (Tr. 35) In 1980, Applicant and his wife started a printing \nbusiness in their home. In 1985, Applicant took a full-time job at a publishing company. \n(Tr. 38) In 1986, Applicant\u2019s brother asked him to join him in a blueprinting business. \nThey stayed in business for 12 years. (Tr. 38) It grew to encompass three locations and \n50 employees. (Tr. 39) That business had no tax problems. (Tr. 82)  \n \n \nIn 1982 two years after opening the business, Applicant first took his business \nrecords to an accountant. (Tr. 58) In June 1981, he was the driver when his car hit a \ntelephone pole killing a high school friend who was a passenger in the car. Applicant \nand his friend had been drinking and after leaving the bar Applicant fell asleep driving \nhome. Applicant was criminally charged with driving while intoxicated. (Gov Ex. 2) \nApplicant\u2019s father died and Applicant and his wife moved 200 miles to a new location. \n(Tr. 59) He did not return to an account until 1986. At that time, the accountant told him \n \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) approved by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of \nDefense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n\n \n \n \n3\n                                                          \nhe owed $100,000 in back taxes and penalties for failing to file his taxes for several \nyears. (Tr. 59) In 1989, Applicant asserts he filed tax returns for tax years 1980 through \n1989.2 (Tr. 60) \n \n \nIn 1985, Applicant turned down a printing job for a member of the former Soviet \nUnion. The Soviet Union wanted a book published by an American printer and was \nwilling to pay a large amount of money. (Tr. 56) Applicant declined the job and called \nthe State Department and the FBI and informed them of the offer.  \n \n \nIn 1998, Applicant sold the business and went back to school to obtain his \nteaching degree. (Tr. 39, 93) He was in school for two years and was sick and could not \nwork for one year. (Tr. 66) In March 2001, Applicant was diagnosed with Hepatitis C, he \nlost 40 pounds in a month and a half, and on some days the most he could accomplish \nduring the day was to walk the dog. (Tr. 90) \n \n \nThe 1998-sale was motivated in part to repay an IRS debt. In 1998, Applicant \nstarted a small printing business using another company\u2019s equipment at night to do his \nprinting. (Tr. 41, 66) He is the only shareholder of a printing corporation. He now works \npart-time copying large documents. (Tr. 40) The corporation is a small business Sub S \ncorporation by which all losses and profits flow through to the individual, who in this \ncase is the Applicant. (Tr. 85) \n \nIn 1992, Applicant hired an attorney to help him address his tax problems. (Tr. \n43) Applicant\u2019s problems with the IRS were compounded by tax agents transferring or \nfor other reasons new agents taking over the case. Applicant asserts when the new tax \nagent took over, the process would start from the beginning again. (Tr. 45) In 1992, \nApplicant made an Offer in Compromise (Offer) to the IRS, which was rejected by the \nIRS. In March 1993, a second offer was made. In October 1994, another offer was \nmade.  \n \nIn 1995, the matter was reassigned to another revenue officer. In April 1996, it \nwas assigned to a different revenue examiner. In June 1996, the examiner \nrecommended acceptance of the offer and submitted the offer through channels. In \nJanuary 1997 the offer was rejected. In 1999, the rejection was sustained. (Tr. 65) Until \nthe final rejection, the statute of limitations on collection of Applicant\u2019s taxes was \nsuspended.  \n \nIn 1993, for approximately one year Applicant made $167 monthly payments to \nthe IRS. (Tr. 46, 61, Ex. A) Additionally, the IRS has intercepted Applicant\u2019s tax refunds \nand applied the overpayment to taxes owed. Applicant had overpaid his taxes in tax \nyears 2002, 2003, and 2004. (Ex. A) In 2003 and 2004, Applicant\u2019s remaining tax \nliability was barred by the statute of limitations. In 2006, the IRS declared his tax \nobligation uncollectible. (Tr. 67, Ex. A)  \n \n \n2 Applicant did not explain how he filed his 1989 taxes in 1989 since the normal filing deadline for \n1989 taxes would have been April 1990.  \n\n \n \n \n4\n \nApplicant was indebted to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for delinquent \ntaxes and penalties. Applicant provided three certificates of Release of Federal Tax Lien \n(Tax Lien Release). On October 12, 1993, a Tax Lien Release was filed releasing \n$97,000 in IRS assessments for tax years 1982 through 1988 and 1999. (Ex A) On \nMarch 12, 2001, a Tax Lien Release was filed releasing $185,000 in assessment for tax \nyears 1985 through and including 1988. (Ex. A) A September 2005, IRS letter stated \nApplicant\u2019s 2004 overpayment of tax refund was applied to taxes owed by Applicant for \n1989 and 1993 On August 16, 2004, a Tax Lien Release was filed releasing $6,600 in \nassessment for tax years 1989 and 1993. (Ex. A) \n \n \nApplicant provided a letter from the state comptroller reported he owes no taxes \nfor tax year 1988, 1990 through 1993, and 1996. (Ex. A)  \n \n \nApplicant had used marijuana off-and-on from high school until 1987 when he \nwas 33 years old. (Tr. 68) He would use it in his home. During this period, there were \ntimes when he did not use it for months or years. (Tr. 68) He thought marijuana and \nprimarily alcohol were making his life unmanageable. After work he would sometimes \ngo out for a beer, and then his use gradually increased to the point where it was all the \ntime. In July 1987, he said no more and quit drinking and smoking marijuana. (Tr. 69, \n88) In 1987, he checked him into a 30-day in-patient substance abuse treatment \nprogram. (Tr. 80) \n \n \nIn March 2001, following a Hepatitis C diagnoses, Applicant became part of a \none year medical clinical study/trial for the drug interferon. Depression was a side affect \nof the drug. When he became depressed, a nurse at the trial told him marijuana helped \nsome people deal with the depression. (Tr. 70, Ex. 2) When he was sick he lost 40 \npounds in a month and a half. The most he could accomplish during the day was to \nwalk the dog. (Tr. 90) \n \nFrom June 2001 until February 2004, Applicant \u2013 then age 47 to 50 \u2013 smoked \nmarijuana daily until arrested in February 2004. At the hearing, Applicant characterized \nhis decision to start using marijuana again as \u201cone of the dumbest decision I ever \nmade.\u201d (Tr. 70) His marijuana use occurred while hold a security clearance, which he \nhad held since 1991. (Tr. 72)  \n \nIn September 2001, he was told he could no longer participate in the study due to \nhis depression. Applicant never saw a health professional concerning his depression, \nbut stated his depression stopped when he stopped using interferon. (Tr. 72) After \nleaving the study, Applicant continued using marijuana which he characterized as a \n\u201cbad decision.\u201d He would usually buy $50 of marijuana at a time, which was a quarter \nounce of marijuana. In February 2004, shortly after purchasing marijuana he was \narrested. Applicant\u2019s case was placed on the Stet docket and then nolle prossed in June \n2005.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s last marijuana use was the day he was arrested. (Tr. 53) He is very \nvigilant to make sure he never uses marijuana again. On August 6, 2008, he signed an \n\n \n \n \n5\n                                                          \naffidavit acknowledging he last used illegal drugs in February 2004 and would not use \nillegal drugs in the future. (Tr. 54) He stated he was willing to submit to drug testing and \nany drug use would result in the loss of any clearance he held. (Ex. D) Applicant \nsubmitted a certificate of completion of a county department of correction and \nrehabilitation intervention program for substance abusers (IPSA), having completed six \nweeks of education in IPSA. (Ex. D)  \n \n \nPolice records pertaining to Applicant\u2019s arrest, detention, or confinement on \nFebruary 23, 2004, and the court records of this action by the district court on October \n18, 2005, were ordered expunged. Following his February 2004 arrest, Applicant \nentered an intervention program for substance abusers for six weeks. (Ex. D) In 2004, \nhe also completed 20 weeks of treatment. (Tr. 52, Ex. D) He learned how to handle \nstress and learned life-skills. (Tr. 53) In August 2008, Applicant was in an outpatient \nprogram. He was assessed as a level two problem/user. (Ex. D) No further treatment \nwas deemed necessary at that time. A drug screen reported August 2008, was positive \nfor opiates for which he had a prescription and negative for PCP, methamphetamine, \nTHC, and cocaine. The prescription was for his arthritis in his hips. (Tr. 55)  \n \nApplicant frequently attends Saturday morning Alcoholic\u2019s Anonymous (AA) \nmeetings. (Tr. 74) His most recent AA token was a ten-year token. (Tr. 81) The token \nthat matters most to him is the one day at a time coin. (Tr. 81)  \n \n \nAs a fourth grade teacher, Applicant makes $50,000 a year. (Tr. 49) He has been \nteaching seven years at a Title 1 school.3 (Tr. 34, 94) His wife makes $35,000 per year \nas a receptionist. His part-time work as a copier makes $2,000 to $10,000 a year. (Tr. \n85). Applicant is current on his rent, utilities, and other debts. He is not being contacted \nby creditors concerning past due obligations. His car is almost paid for and he is current \non his student loans on which he pays $200 per month. (Tr. 92) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n \n3 Title 1 is a federal entitlement program to help students who are behind academically or at risk \nof falling behind. Applicant states Title 1 schools means schools for the very poor. (Tr. 94) \n \n\n \n \n \n6\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n\n \n \n \n7\nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial obligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant had a history of financial \nproblems. Applicant failed to file his 1980 through 1989 income taxes until 1989. At one \ntime he owed the IRS $185,000 in back taxes. Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d AG \u00b619(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations,\u201d and AG \u00b619(g), \u201cfailure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns as required,\u201d apply. \n \nIn 1980, Applicant opened a small business. Two years later he went to an \naccountant. He did not return to the accountant until 1986. He had been involved in an \nauto accident and resulting court action, his father had died, and he had made a 200 \nmile move. Taxes were filed in 1989, resulting in $100,000 owed to the IRS. Starting in \n1992, numerous offers in compromise where made, rejected, and resubmitted. \nApplicant made sporadic payments and any tax refund he was due was intercepted to \npay his past due tax obligation. In 2006, the IRS declared his tax obligation \nuncollectible. \n \n \nApplicant provided three certificates of Release of Federal Tax. In October 1993, \n$97,000 was released for tax years 1982 through 1988 and 1999. In March 2001, \n$185,000 in assessment was released for tax years 1985 through and including 1988. \nIn September 2005, a Tax Lien Release was filed releasing $6,600 in assessment for \ntax years 1989 and 1993, which had been filed in August 2004. Applicant provided a \nletter from the state comptroller stating he owed no taxes for tax year 1988, 1990 \nthrough 1993, and 1996. \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \n\n \n \n \n8\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; [and] \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(a), Applicant=s financial problems with the IRS started with his \nfailure to file his 1980 income tax return. Applicant first attempted to correct the problem \nby seeking legal help in 1992 \u2013 16 years ago. Between October 1993 and August 2004, \nthe tax liens were released and in 2006 his tax obligations were declared uncollectible. \nFrom 1992 through 2006, he was actively pursuing the correction of his tax problems. \nAfter 14 years of involvement with the IRS it is unlikely he will again incur tax \ndelinquencies. AG \u00b6 20(a) applies. \n \nAG & 20(b) does apply. AG & 20(c) applies when a \u201cperson has received or is \nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control.\u201d Applicant owes no money to the IRS or the state \ntax commission. Applicant is current on his rent, utilities, and other debts. He is not \nbeing contacted by creditors concerning past due obligations. His car is almost paid for \nand he is current on his student loans. There are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control. \n \nAG & 20(d) requires a good-faith effort to repay the creditors and AG & 20(e) \napplies when the legitimacy of the debt is disputed. Applicant made numerous offers in \ncompromise over the years. There is no evidence as to the details of the offers. \nHowever, IRS found the offers insufficient to justify acceptance, except for his assertion \nthat one examiner forward an offer recommending approval. Without the details of the \noffer it is impossible to say they constituted a \u201cgood-faith\u201d effort to repay the debt.  \n \nAdditionally, the record is insufficient to establish Applicant had a reasonable \nbasis to dispute the \u201clegitimacy\u201d of his delinquent taxes. Nothing in the record indicates \nhe was challenging the validity of his tax debts or took the matter to tax court. It appears \nhe was simply arguing over the amount of taxes owed and not the legitimacy of the \ntaxes. AG & 20(d) and AG & 20(e) do not apply.  \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n9\nDrug Involvement \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: Use of \nan illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's \nreliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it \nraises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) any drug abuse; \n \n(b) testing positive for illegal drug use; \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug abuse or drug dependence; \n \n(e) evaluation of drug abuse or drug dependence by a licensed clinical \nsocial worker who, is a staff member of a recognized drug treatment \nprogram; \n \n(f) failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed by \na duly qualified medical professional; \n \n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance; and \n \n(h) expressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and \nconvincingly commit to discontinue drug use. \n \nApplicant had used marijuana off-and-on from high school until 1987 when he \nwas 33 years old. During this period, there were times when he did not use it for months \nor years. He quit because he thought marijuana and alcohol were making his life \nunmanageable. In June 2001, he resumed using marijuana daily and continued until his \narrest in February 2004. His most recent use occurred when he held a security \nclearance.  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a) drug use, AG \u00b6 25(c) purchase, and AG \u00b6 25(g) illegal drug use after \nhave being granted a security clearance apply.  \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n\n \n \n \n10\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and, \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation; \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand, \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n  \n \nApplicant last used marijuana in February 2004, approximately four and a half \nyears ago. Applicant characterized his decision to start using marijuana again in 2004 \nas \u201cone of the dumbest decision I ever made.\u201d Applicant stated he would not use illegal \ndrugs in the future. In August 2008, he signed an affidavit stating he would submit to \ndrug testing and any drug use would result in the loss of his clearance. He is very \nvigilant to make sure he never uses again. \n \nFollowing his arrest, he entered an intervention program for substance abusers. \nHe learned how to handle stress and learned life-skills. As of August 2008, Applicant \nwent to an outpatient program where additional treatment was not recommended. \nApplicant frequently attends Saturday morning AA meetings and has been involved with \nAA for ten years. However, the token that matters most to him is the one day at a time \ntoken. Applicant completed a county department of correction and rehabilitation \nintervention program for substance abusers. \n \nApplicant used marijuana daily for four years. His use can not be said to be \ninfrequent. However, It has been more than four and a half years since his last \nmarijuana use. There are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when conduct is \u201crecent.\u201d \nThe determination must be based \u201con a careful evaluation of the totality of the record \nwithin the parameters set by the directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. \nAug. 4, 2004). For example, the Appeal Board determined in ISCR Case No. 98-0608 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 28, 1997), that an applicant's last use of marijuana occurring \n\n \n \n \n11\n                                                          \napproximately 17 months before the hearing was not recent. If the evidence shows \u201ca \nsignificant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,\u201d then an \nadministrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates \u201cchanged \ncircumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.\u201d4 \n \nBecause of his abstention from drug use for four and a half years, and his \nrecognition of the adverse impact on his life of drug abuse, there is reasonable certitude \nthat he will continue to abstain from drug use. This finding is made knowing Applicant \nhad abstained from illegal drug usage for 14 years \u2013 from 1987 through 2004 \u2013 before \nusing marijuana again. However, Applicant\u2019s return to using marijuana, which he \nacknowledges was a stupid thing to do, was a misdirected approach to addressing his \ndepression caused by his participation in a clinical study. Applicant did not attempt to \nhide his arrest or illegal usage. He listed both on his April 2007 SF 86. His marijuana \nuse ending more than four years ago does not cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. Because he will not use illegal drugs in the future, \nconfidence in his current reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment with respect to \ndrug use is restored. AG \u00b6 26(a) applies. \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) applies because he has stated he will not use illegal drugs in the \nfuture. He has demonstrated his intent not to abuse drugs in the future by the four and a \nhalf years since his last use and by signing a statement of intent with automatic \nrevocation of his clearance for any violation.  \n \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). In ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. \nBd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board reversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the \nabsence of drug use for five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge \nexcessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 plus years of drug \nuse, and gave too little weight to lifestyle changes and therapy. For the recency analysis the Appeal \nBoard stated:  \n \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although the passage \nof three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did not, standing alone, compel \nthe administrative judge to apply Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of \nlaw, the Judge erred by failing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply \nthat mitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) with ISCR \nCase No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe administrative judge articulated a \nrational basis for why she had doubts about the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at \nalcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) (citation format corrections added). \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-11392 at 1-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2006) the Appeal Board, considered the recency \nanalysis of an administrative judge stating: \n \nThe administrative judge made sustainable findings as to a lengthy and serious history of \nimproper or illegal drug use by a 57-year-old Applicant who was familiar with the security \nclearance process.  That history included illegal marijuana use two to three times a year \nfrom 1974 to 2002 [drug use ended four years before hearing].  It also included the illegal \npurchase of marijuana and the use of marijuana while holding a security clearance. \n \n\n \n \n \n12\nAG \u00b6 26(c) does not apply because abuse of prescription drugs was not a \nproblem. AG \u00b6 26(d) applies because he has satisfactorily completed a drug treatment \nprogram, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. Applicant completed 20 weeks of treatment in 2004 and six weeks \nof education with IPSA. As of August 2008, no further treatment was necessary. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct, which is \nconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \n \nApplicant used marijuana after having been issued a secret security clearance, \nwhich was alleged under Guideline H, drug involvement. Under AG \u00b6 16 conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include AG \u00b6 16(d) \u201ccredible \nadverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not \nbe sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all \navailable information supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly \nsafeguard protected information.  \n \nThere is nothing different in listing his use of marijuana after obtaining a \nclearance under both criminal conduct and personal conduct. The underlying security \nconcern remains the same. Having found for Applicant for this event under criminal \nconduct, I find no additional disqualifying or additional security concerns under the \npersonal conduct guideline. \n \nSince illegal drug use after having been issued a clearance is specifically \ncovered by Guideline H, drug involvement, I find Guideline E, personal conduct, does \nnot apply to this drug use allegation. I find for Applicant as to SOR \u00b6 3 a.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n \n \n13\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant no longer has a debt to \nthe IRS. Between 1992 and 2004, he was actively attempting to negotiate a settlement \nwith the IRS. He recognized the problem, hired an attorney to help him correct his tax \nproblem, and actively sought to negotiate a settlement of the problem. He is living within \nhis means and is current on his debts.  \n \nApplicant has been married 32 years, is hard working, diligent, and responsible. \nHis friends and co-workers praise his character and dedication. He smoked marijuana \ndaily while holding a clearance, but that use ended more than four years ago. He has \nreceived treatment and showed remorse. He is active in AA and is sincere when he \nstates he will not use again.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations, drug involvement, and personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a and 1.b:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Drug Involvement:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a \u2013 2.d: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Personal Conduct:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n14\nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nStatement of the Case\n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (e-QIP), on November 10,\n2005. On March 20, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns for Applicant under\nGuideline B. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.\nAugust 29, 2008\n\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 9, 2008 and requested a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge. In his answer he admitted four (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., d., e.,and\ng.) and denied the other five of the nine allegations in the SOR. Department Counsel\nwas prepared to proceed on May 22, 2008. I received the case assignment on May 27,\n2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 6, 2008, for a hearing on June 16,\n2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nAt the hearing, the government offered two exhibits (Exhs 1 and 2) that were\nadmitted in evidence without objection. The government also offered two additional\nexhibits (Exhs. 3 and 4) in rebuttal to Applicant\u2019s testimony and they were admitted.\nApplicant submitted ten exhibits (Exhs.

DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on June\n24, 2008.\nProcedural Rulings\nNotice of Hearing\nThe hearing notice was dated less than 15 days before the hearing date. I\nadvised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice before\nthe hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to the 15 days notice and indicated\nhe was ready to proceed (Tr. 9).\nAdministrative Notice\nThe government requested that administrative notice be taken of seven official\nU.S. government documents relating to Afghanistan and security concerns of the U.S.\narising from terrorism. With no objection from Applicant, the documents were accepted\nfor notice. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 38-year-old Afghan male who has an offer of employment from a\ngovernment contractor to provide services as a translator for the U.S. military in\nAfghanistan. He now works as a production manager for a private company where he\nsupervises 45 employees. \nApplicant came to the U.S. in 1989 when he was 18 years old with his family. He\nemigrated from Pakistan where he had been in a school since 1987 sponsored by the\nU.S. government for children of Afghan forces working against the occupation by the\nformer Soviet Union. He became a U.S. citizen in 2002.\nApplicant has several relatives living in Afghanistan or with familial connections\nthere. His wife lives in the U.S. but is a citizen of Afghanistan. She recently has applied\nfor U.S. citizenship. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.). She has several family members residing there\nincluding two underage siblings. She maintains contact with her parents and other\n\n3\nrelatives on a regular basis. Applicant\u2019s mother was a citizen of Afghanistan but is now\na U.S. citizen residing in the U.S. with him (SOR\u00b6 1.b.). He has contacts with his wife\u2019s\nrelatives but less frequently than she. \nApplicant\u2019s father is a professor with a Ph.D degree who emigrated to the U.S. in\nthe mid 1980's and taught a medical subject at a U.S. university. He was active in\nAfghanistan fighting against the Soviets and returned to Afghanistan in 2002 after the\ncollapse of the Taliban. He left his family in the U.S., remarried, and now teaches at an\nAfghan university (SOR\u00b6 1.c.). Applicant and others in the family are not on good terms\nwith him and have little contact with him.\nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law, and father-in-law are citizens of and residing in\nAfghanistan where they teach lower grades in a school. He has three sisters-in-law who\nare from Afghanistan. One is a U.S. citizen living in the U.S. The second lives in\nCanada and is applying for Canadian citizenship. The third lives in Germany and is\napplying for German citizenship. These in-laws are subjects of two allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.d. and 1.e.).\nApplicant made two statements to investigators during his security investigation\nconcerning his friendship or acquaintance with an influential leader who was fighting the\nTaliban in Afghanistan. This information was not true, as he has acknowledged (Tr.46).\nHowever, he did not claim to be a relative of the person or involved with his organization\nas was alleged. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h. and i.). The person in question was an acquaintance and\ncolleague of Applicant\u2019s father.\nApplicant traveled to Pakistan in 1990 and 1991 to help his sister and her two\nchildren gain visas to the U.S. All three are now U.S. citizens living in the U.S. In 2002\nhe traveled twice to Pakistan. The first trip was to accompany his sister-in-law for the\nfuneral of her sister, since her husband could not accompany her. The second trip was\nto accompany his wife to the U.S. because she had just received a visa to travel to the\nU.S. In 2005 he traveled to Afghanistan to attend the wedding of a sister-in-law and to\nexplore business opportunities for his present employer who does work in the Middle\nEast. No business sources were developed. \nApplicant does not have a security clearance but desires one so that he can\nreturn to his country of origin and make a contribution to the U.S. national defense by\nworking for the U.S. military as a translator for at least one year. His interest in taking\nthe new job in Afghanistan stems from doing work on two occasions as a translator for\nthe Army in military exercises in the U.S. in 2007. He did this work while on vacation\nfrom his regular job. He was highly regarded for his work and commended by the\ncommanding officer of the unit he worked with (Exh. D) and given a citation for his work\nwith the units (Exh. C). \nApplicant\u2019s wife is studying to be a medical assistant. They have one three-year-\nold daughter. His annual salary from his current employment is approximately $60,000.\nHe is highly regarded by his present employer for his skills and dedication (Exhs. F-J).\n\n4\nHis salary from his prospective job would be approximately the same as from his\npresent employment. \nThe U.S. military is heavily involved in combating insurgent forces in Afghanistan\nand it is an unstable country. Large parts of it are under the control of Taliban\ninsurgents and it is a dangerous part of the world where there are human rights abuses\nand acts of terrorism. The documents that were admitted for administrative notice\ndescribe the situation as it is found there in official U.S. government sources (Exhs. I-\nVII). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\n\u201cthe whole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\n\n5\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) listing multiple prerequisites for\naccess to classified or sensitive information. \nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nlegal precepts, factors and conditions above, I conclude the following with respect to all\nallegations set forth in the SOR: \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in\nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism\nConditions under Guideline B that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying include contact with a foreign family member who is a citizen of, or resident\nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion (AG \u00b6 7a). A second condition that could\nraise a security concern include connections to a foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry that create potential conflict of interest between the individual and desire to help\na foreign person by providing information (AG \u00b6 7(b). \nBased on the evidence of record, including Applicant\u2019s acknowledgment of family\nmembers living abroad, and his statement to investigators, the Government established\na basis for concern over foreign influence. The Applicant had the burden to establish\nsecurity suitability through evidence which refutes, mitigates, or extenuates the\ndisqualification and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant a security clearance. ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n\n6\nMitigating conditions (MC) that might be applicable are a determination that the\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which the persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual group or government and the interests of the U.S. (AG \u00b6\n8a). A second possible MC is if the contacts with foreign persons is so infrequent to be\ndeemed casual (AG \u00b6 8c). However, by virtue of the close relationships of the foreign\nfamily members, Applicant\u2019s contacts, though infrequent, cannot be deemed casual.\nAlso, if the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the\nU.S.,that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. (AG \u00b6\n8b).\nThe fact that some relatives live in Afghanistan, and the history of that country as\nto military activities makes it a heightened security risk. U.S. troops are fighting Taliban\nforces in Afghanistan. They need translators for their operations and Applicant seeks to\noffer a service. He has performed such services well in the military exercises in which he\nparticipated as concluded by the commander of the unit with which he served. \nHowever, the fact that he exaggerated contacts with a significant Afghan leader\nwho was helping U.S. forces, and the fact that he wants the clearance to work possibly\nfor only one year creates some security concern that is not overcome by his desire to\nserve his country. While it is commendable that he wants to serve the military in a\nneeded capacity, it is not clear to me that his motivation is sufficiently strong as to\novercome the security issues raised by the fact that he has close relatives who live in\nAfghanistan. The travels are of lesser concern. His service as a translator for the U.S.\ngovernment could well be performed in the U.S. for agencies that need the service here\nwithout the risk of sending him to a country where family members reside. The mitigating\nconditions are not applicable to the facts as presented by Applicant. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\n7\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I considered the\npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding this case. The security concerns do not arise because of any\nmisconduct by Applicant but solely because of the family members living in a country\nwith security concerns. While his motivation for seeking a security clearance is\ncommendable, his exaggeration to the investigator and his desire to perform work\nabroad for possibly only a short period leaves doubts as to the wisdom of granting a\nclearance in these circumstances. \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from these issues of\nforeign influence.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.: For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f.:  Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.: Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h.: For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i.:  For Applicant \nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Access to classified information is denied. \n___________________\nCHARLES D. ABLARD \nAdministrative Judge\n",

Rigney, Esquire\n \n                                \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his\neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on January 7, 2008. The SOR is equivalent to\nan administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues in\nthis case fall under Guideline H based on Applicant\u2019s drug involvement. For the reasons\ndiscussed below, this case is decided against Applicant.\nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nJune 27, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n2\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n2\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date.  \nApplicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR was received on January 28, 2008, and he\nrequested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on April 10, 2008. The hearing took\nplace as scheduled on May 16, 2008. The transcript (Tr.) was received on June 2, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted all the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\u20131.g. Based on the\nrecord evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 24-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has worked as a\nsoftware engineer for his current employer since June 2006. He married in August\n2006, and he and his wife have no children. He is seeking to obtain an industrial\nsecurity clearance for the first time.  \nHe was a college student from August 2001 to May 2006, when he earned a\nbachelor\u2019s degree in computer engineering. He engaged in drug abuse while in college\nby using both illegal and prescription drugs. He admits a history of drug involvement\nfrom about September 2000 to December 2006 as follows:\n\u2022\nHe used marijuana about 200 times from September 2000 to December 2006;\n\u2022\nHe purchased marijuana;\n\u2022\nHe used Lortab, without a valid prescription, about 10 times in 2002; \n\u2022\nHe used Klonapin, without a valid prescription, about 5 times in 2002;\n\u2022\nHe used Zanex, without a valid prescription, about 5 times in 2002;\n\u2022\nHe used LSD about 2 times in 2002; and\n\u2022\nHe used Ecstacy about 1 time in 2002.\nHe disclosed, in detail, his drug involvement when he completed a security-\nclearance application in March 2007 (Exhibit 1\u2013response to Question 24a). He provided\nthe following comments about his marijuana use:\nThough I continued to use this drug occasionally throughout my college\ncareer, I only allowed myself to do so given that I was able to maintain my\nacademic record. Given that this was somewhat of a past time with many\nof my college friends with whom I still interact, I continued to use it a few\ntimes after college. But, as with the other listed substances, as of my last\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n3\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain\nth\nthat there is no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases\nsuch as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n4\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n5\n3\nrecorded date of use, I will have no more such contact with this, or any\nother controlled substance (Exhibit 1 at 8). \nIn addition to the security-clearance application, he confirmed and provided additional\ninformation about his drug involvement in his background interview of August 2007\n(Exhibit 2). \nIn his hearing testimony, he stated that he no longer intends to abuse any drugs\nor controlled substances. To that end, he took three drug tests in February and May\n2008, the results of which were negative (Exhibit C). In addition to the drug tests,\nApplicant submitted two affidavits in which he declared an unequivocal intent to abstain\nfrom the abuse of any drugs or controlled substances in the future (Exhibits A and B).\nAlso, his affidavits include a clause in which he consented to automatic revocation of a\nsecurity clearance for any violation.\nHe acknowledged that his employer has a drug-free policy, and he was required\nto pass a drug test for his employment (Tr. 47\u201348). Also, he acknowledged that his\nmarijuana use in December 2006, six months after starting work, was contrary to his\nemployer\u2019s policy (Tr. 54). He characterized the December 2006 marijuana use as an\nirresponsible choice and a lapse in judgment. \nIn December 2006, he used marijuana, in the presence of his wife, at a holiday\nparty with friends. His marijuana use was very upsetting to his wife, and she described\nhis behavior as stupid (Tr. 117). Since the incident, she has communicated her attitude\nthat drug use is not part of their marriage, she believes he understands her position,\nand she believes he has made a commitment to her in this regard (Tr. 117\u2013118).   \n  \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.3\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2)  revokes\n5\nany existing security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\n\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n6\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n7\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n11\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n4\nlevel.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n6\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor\nof protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n7\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n8\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n9\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n10\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.11\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n13\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\n\n Revised Guidelines at 17\u201318 (setting forth the security concern as well as the disqualifying and mitigating\n14\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at 17. \n15\n Revised Guidelines at 17. \n16\n Revised Guidelines at 17. \n17\n Revised Guidelines at 18. \n18\n5\nAnalysis\n1.\nThe Drug Involvement Security Concern\nUnder Guideline H for drug involvement,  the security concern is that \u201cuse of an\n14\nillegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's\nreliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it\nraises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and\nregulations.\u201d  The definition of drug abuse is \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal\n15\ndrug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d16\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, the following conditions raise a\nsecurity concern:\n\u2022\nAny drug abuse (see above definition); and \n\u2022\nIllegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase,\nsale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.17\nApplicant\u2019s history of drug involvement raises security concerns because it calls\ninto question his judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and willingness to obey the law.\nTo start, however, the non-marijuana drug abuse took place but a few times several\nyears ago in 2002 when he was a young college student. On that basis, these matters\nare decided for Applicant. \nMarijuana use was the majority of his drug involvement. He used it about 200\ntimes, which goes beyond experimentation or youthful indiscretion. Using marijuana\nabout 200 times during a six-year period is fairly described as regular use. Aggravating\nthe situation is his marijuana use in December 2006, which took place a few months\nafter he started his employment in the defense industry. He used grossly poor judgment\nin doing so.  \nThe four MC under Guideline H have been considered and one of the four\napplies in Applicant\u2019s favor. Applicant is credited with demonstrating an intent not to\nabuse drugs in the future.  His intent is demonstrated by abstinence from drug abuse\n18\nfrom December 2006 to May 16, 2008 (a period of about 17 months), and his affidavits\n(Exhibits A and B). \n\n Revised Guidelines at 1\u20132. \n19\n6\n2.\nThe Whole-Person Concept \nUnder the Directive, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the relevant facts and circumstances. This analysis includes nine\nadjudicative factors:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n19\nI considered all nine factors as well as the favorable testimony from Applicant\u2019s\nseveral witnesses. In particular, for the second factor, I considered the circumstance\nthat the vast majority of Applicant\u2019s drug abuse took place while he was a college\nstudent and that is no longer the case. He is now a young adult with far more\nresponsibilities, to include his spouse and his job. To that end, he appeared clean cut,\nappropriate, and serious at the hearing, in contrast to his appearance when he was\nabusing drugs in college (Exhibit D). And for the fourth factor, I considered Applicant\u2019s\nage and maturity and conclude that, for the most part, he was a young-and-dumb\ncollege student when he engaged in the drug abuse (this is especially so for the non-\nmarijuana drug abuse in 2002). \nIn addition, I considered the circumstance that Applicant disclosed his drug\nabuse when he completed his security-clearance application and in response to\ninterrogatories. He deserves credit for reporting this adverse information, and it comes\ninto play for the eighth and ninth factors. His disclosure of his drug abuse reduces the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress. Likewise, his disclosure, when\ncombined with the other favorable evidence, reduces the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence of drug abuse.\nThis case presents both unfavorable and favorable evidence, which requires\nthoughtful balancing in light of the clearly-consistent standard. I have considered the\ntotality of facts and circumstances and conclude that the favorable evidence is not\npersuasive. His marijuana use during a six-year period is too frequent (200 times) and\ntoo recent (about 17 months ago) to be mitigated. Although he signed affidavits\nexpressing an intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, it is too soon to determine if\nhe has made a permanent change in his behavior. Based on the evidence, it is just as\nlikely that his stated intent not to abuse drugs is situational behavior in response to this\nproceeding, much like his marijuana use in December 2006 was situational behavior in\n\n7\nresponse to the holiday party. His corrective actions to date are noteworthy, but are not\nenough to overcome the poor judgment he demonstrated by his regular marijuana use\nduring several years, especially his marijuana use after he started working in the\ndefense industry in 2006. What is missing here is a long-term record of abstinence that\nwould be persuasive evidence of his intent to permanently change his behavior. \nApplicant did not present sufficient evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the drug involvement security concerns.

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: B. Daniel Lynch, Esquire\nJune 3, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on -------------,\n2007. On -----------, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on -------------, 2007. He answered\nthe SOR in writing through counsel on ----------, 2007, and requested a hearing before\nan Administrative Judge. DOHA received the request on -------------, 2007. Department\nCounsel was prepared to proceed on ----------------, 2007, and I received the case\nassignment on --------------, 2007. I granted Applicant\u2019s request for a delay until ------------\n, 2007, in order for his counsel to be available. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on ------\n------------, 2007, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on -------------, 2007. The\ngovernment offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through ---, which were received without objection.\nApplicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through ----, without\nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on ----------------, 2007. I\n\n2\ngranted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until ---------------, 2007, to submit\nadditional matters.  On -----------------, 2007, he submitted Exhibit ---, without objection.\nThe record closed on ----------------, 2007. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\n(granted) (denied).\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts concerning the current political conditions in ------------.  Applicant had no\nobjection.  (Tr. p. 27).  The request and the attached documents were not admitted into\nevidence but were included in the record. The facts administratively noticed are set out\nin the Findings of Fact, below. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the\ntestimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is --- years of age and has a ------------------.\nHe is employed as a ---------------------- for a defense contractor.  He seeks a security\nclearance in connection with his employment in the defense industry.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign contacts\nthat could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise\nof classified information.\n \nI have taken official notice of the following facts concerning the Taiwan.  Taiwan\nis a multi-party democracy with a population of about 23 million. It is one of the most\nactive collectors of sensitive United States information and technology.  Numerous\nindividuals and companies have been subjected to civil penalties and or prosecuted for\nillegally exporting, or attempting to illegally export, sensitive United States technology to\nTaiwan.  One United States official was recently convicted of crimes relating to his\nimproper relationship with a Taiwanese intelligence official.\nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the\nDepartment of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors\nand conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given\nbinding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors\nshould be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the\nconditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can\nthey supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\n\n3\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and\ncircumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human\nexperience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth\nabove, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:\nForeign Influence\n6.  The Concern.  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism. \nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n7.  (a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion. \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n8.  (a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country\nare such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.;\n8.  (c) Contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent\nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\n\n4\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\neligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is\npredicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The\nadjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the\nwhole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination. \nThe Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw\ninferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in\nnature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865,\n\u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline B (foreign influence)\nthat establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While\na rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct\nand his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency\nof proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in\nrefutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past\nadverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for\na security clearance.\nAn individual who demonstrates a foreign influence ad has foreign connections\nmay be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests\nof the United States.  The mere possession of a foreign passport raises legitimate\nquestions as to whether the Applicant can be counted upon to place the interests of the\nUnited States paramount to that of another nation. The Government must be able to\nplace a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security\nrules and regulations, at all times and in all places.\n\n5\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal\nstandards and factors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the\nrecord, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its\ncase as to all allegations in the SOR.   \nUnder Foreign Influence, Disqualifying Condition 7(a) contact with a foreign\nfamily member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a\ncitizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion applies.  However,\nMitigating Conditions 8(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the\ncountry in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group,\norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S, and 8(c) Contact or\ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little\nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation also apply.\nAlthough the Applicant\u2019s has ----------------- who are residents and citizens of ------\n----------------------, the Applicant is not close to them and except for holidays, rarely has\ncontact with them.  There is no evidence of a close bond or strong evidence of affection.\nThe Applicant\u2019s deep and abiding ties are here in the United States.  For the past --------\n------years he has worked hard to establish himself as a responsible, educated,\nAmerican citizen.  His ----------------, are all citizens and residents of the United States.\nHis advanced education, employment with the DOD, assets, that include his home,\nmany investments and retirement benefits are all in the United States.  The Applicant\nessentially cut all ties from ----------- when he moved to the United States and made it\nhis permanent home for the past ------------------.  \nIt is noted that the current political situation in -------------- elevates the cause for\nconcern in this case.  However, the evidence shows that the Applicant has no bond and\naffection with his foreign ----------- or to any foreign individual or to Taiwan in any way\nthat could potentially cause the Applicant to become subject to foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  Therefore, there is no possibility of\nforeign influence that exists that could create the potential for conduct resulting in the\ncompromise of classified information.  I find that the Applicant is not vulnerable to\nforeign influence.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant under Guideline B (Foreign\nInfluence).\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has met the mitigating conditions of\nGuideline B of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.\nAccordingly, he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline B.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\n\n6\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\nSubparas.\n1.a.: For the Applicant\nSubparas.\n1.b.: For the Applicant\nSubparas.\n1.c.: For the Applicant\nSubparas.\n1.d.: For the Applicant\nSubparas.\n1.e.: For the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n \n",

On February 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the trustworthiness concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations; Guideline E, Personal Conduct; and Guideline J, \nCriminal Conduct, for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) \nRegulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as amended \n(Regulation), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on \nDecember 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after \nSeptember 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 22, 2008, and requested a decision on the \nwritten record.  On March 27, 2008, Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant \nMaterial (FORM).  The FORM was forwarded to Applicant on March 28, 2008. Applicant \n \n1 \n \nJuly 24, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nsigned the receipt on April 7, 2008. Applicant had thirty days from the receipt of the FORM \nto submit a response.  No additional response was submitted. On June 24, 2008, the \nFORM was forwarded to the hearing office.  The case was assigned to me for decision on \nthat date. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access \nto sensitive information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted to SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.k, and 2.a \nand 2.b. She neither admits or denies the allegation in \u00b6 3.a. In addition, after a thorough \nand careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a Department of Defense contractor who is \nseeking a position of public trust.

She did not list the delinquent debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a -1.j.   \n \nA subsequent background investigation discovered the following delinquent \naccounts: an $858 catalogue account charged off as a bad debt in June 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.a; \nItem 5 at 3; Item 6 at 2.); a $1,923 credit card account charged off as a bad debt in \nSeptember 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.b; Item 5 at 3; Item 6 at 2); a $1,231 credit card account \ncharged off as a bad debt in November 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.c; Item 5 at 3; Item 6 at 1); a $1,241 \ncredit card account charged off as a bad debt in November 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.d; Item 5 at 3; \nItem 6 at 2); a $3,090 credit card account charged off as a bad debt in December 2003 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e; Item 5 at 3; Item 6 at 2); a $1,028.36 credit card account charged off as a bad \ndebt in April 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.f; Item 5 at 4; Item 6 at 2); a $2,034 judgment entered in May \n2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.g; Item 6 at 1); a $3,114 account  placed for collection in July 2005 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.h; Item 5 at 4; Item 6 at 1); a $2,798 account, charged off as a bad debt in October 2005 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.i; Item 5 at 3); a $590 account charged off as a bad debt in December 2005 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.j; Item 5 at 4; Item 6 at 2); and a $1,608 credit card account placed for collection \nin July 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.k; Item 6 at 7). \n \nIn response to interrogatories, dated November 8, 2007, Applicant indicated that she \nbegan to have financial problems while in college. She made poor financial decisions and \n\n \n3 \n \nover extended herself on credit cards. She indicated that she intended to research her \naccounts and is considering filing for bankruptcy. (Item 5.)  \n \nApplicant claims that all of these debts are old and that she is current on her recent \naccounts. Her net monthly income is $1,360. Her monthly expenses are $1,305. She has \n$55 left over each month after expenses. The expenses do not include payments towards \nher delinquent accounts. (Item 5 at 5.) No proof was provided that any of these accounts \nwere paid or resolved.   \n \nApplicant initially stated that she did not list the delinquent accounts on her \ntrustworthiness application because they were so old. (Item 5 at 4.) In her response to the \nSOR, she admits to deliberately failing to list her debts in response to questions 22.a and \n22.b on her trustworthiness application. (Item 3.)  \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as Asensitive positions.@  \n(See Regulation && C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  AThe standard that must be met for . . \nassignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person=s \nloyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive \nduties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.@ (See Regulation & \nC6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) \nMemorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness adjudications will apply \nto cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service and Office of Personnel \nManagement.  Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the \nprocedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination \nmay be made. (See Regulation & C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant=s suitability for a public trust position, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge=s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and common sense decision. According to AG & 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the Awhole person concept.@ The \nAdministrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG & 2(b) \nrequires that A[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.@ In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nUnder Directive & E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive & E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting Awitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .@ The Applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable trustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \nApplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be Ain terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.@ See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for \naccess to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk \nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant has a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations.  She admits to having 11 delinquent debts with a total approximate \nbalance of $19,518.       \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable.  Applicant has not \n\n \n5 \n \nresolved any of the delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR.  Her financial issues remain.  \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected \nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances) does not apply. There is no information in the record raising the \npotential application of this mitigating condition.  \n \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control) \ndoes not apply. There is nothing in the record which indicated Applicant attended financial \ncounseling.  Applicant has not provided evidence indicating that any of her delinquent \naccounts have been paid and/or resolved. It is unlikely her financial situation will be \nresolved in the near future.  \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors \nor otherwise resolve debts) does not apply because Applicant made not attempt to resolve \nany of her delinquent accounts.  \n \nApplicant has not mitigated the concerns raised under Guideline F.    \n \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in AG \n&15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to \ncooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nPersonal conduct concerns are raised because Applicant failed to list a judgment \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g) entered against her within seven years of the date she completed her \ntrustworthiness application in response to question 22a. She also failed to list her \ndelinquent debts that were over 180 days old (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.j) in response to question \n22b.    \n \n \nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) applies to Applicant\u2019s case. In her \nresponse to the SOR, she admits that she deliberately omitted a judgment and her \ndelinquent debts in response to questions 22.a and 22.b on the trustworthiness application. \n\n \n6 \n \n(Item 3.)   \n \n \nPersonal conduct concerns can be mitigated.  The following Personal Conduct \nMitigating Conditions (PC MC) potentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case: \n \n \nPC MC \u00b6 17(a) (the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts) does not \napply.  There is no evidence that Applicant attempted to correct the omission of her \nfinancial issues on her trustworthiness application.  \n \n \nPC MC \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment) does not apply.  Applicant\u2019s deliberate omission of her financial difficulties on her \ntrustworthiness application is considered serious.  Her failure to provide full disclosure of \nher financial history raises questions about her reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment.  \n \n \nPC MC \u00b6 17(d) (the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate \nbehavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur) because Applicant did not acknowledge \nthe behavior until she received the SOR.  There is nothing in the record evidence to show \nthat Applicant has taken positive steps to prevent this behavior in the future.  \n \n \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns raised under personal conduct. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern raised under the criminal conduct guideline is set forth in \u00b6 30 of the \nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines: \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \n \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \n \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nThere are two Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) that apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case. They are CC DC \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser \noffenses); CC DC \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted).  Applicant\u2019s \ndeliberate omission of her delinquent debts, including one judgment, on her  \ntrustworthiness application violated Title 18 U.S.C \u00a71001.  While somewhat redundant to \nthe concerns raised under guideline E, personal conduct, her deliberate omissions on her \ntrustworthiness application raises a concern under criminal conduct because it violates a \nfederal statute. When Applicant signed the trustworthiness application, she certified that \n\u201cMy statements on this form, and any attachments to it, are true, complete, and correct to \n\n \n7 \n \nthe best of my knowledge and belief and are made in good faith. I understand that a \nknowing and willful false statement on this form can be punished by fine or imprisonment or \nboth. (See section 1001 of Title 18, United States Code.)\u201d (Item Gov 4.)  Applicant was on \nnotice that any false information deliberately provided on the application was a crime.  \n \nThe criminal conduct concern can be mitigated. I find that it is premature to apply \nCriminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC MC) \u00b6 32(a) (so much time has elapsed since \nthe criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment) because Applicant\u2019s deliberate falsification was recent.   \n \nIt is premature to apply CC MC \u00b6 32(d) (there is evidence of successful \nrehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal \nactivity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement) for the same reasons mentioned above.   \n \nAt this time, it is premature to conclude that Applicant has mitigated the criminal \nconduct concern. \n \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of \nthe conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and \nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; \nand (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate \ndetermination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall \ncommon sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole \nperson concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Financial consideration concerns remain \ndue to the extensive amount of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debt and her lack of effort towards \nresolving her delinquent accounts. Her deliberate failure to provide truthful answers about \nher delinquent debts in response to question 22.a and 22.b on her trustworthiness \napplication raise questions about her reliability, trustworthiness and judgment. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under financial \nconsiderations, personal conduct, and criminal conduct. \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.

Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign \nInfluence), based on Applicant\u2019s family ties to Iran and Sweden. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SF 86) on May 15, 2007. \nOn April 8, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guideline B. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nSeptember 23, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 24, 2008; answered it on \nMay 12, 2008; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received \nthe request on May 15, 2008. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on May 31, \n2008, and the case was assigned to me on June 13, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on July 29, 2008, scheduling the hearing for August 25, 2008. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence \nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AX) A through E, which were admitted without objection. I granted Department \nCounsel\u2019s request to keep the record open until September 2, 2008, to submit additional \nmaterials pertaining the Sweden. Department Counsel timely submitted his additional \nmaterials to support a request for administrative notice, discussed below. The record \nclosed on September 2, 2008. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on September 3, \n2008. \n \nAmendment of the SOR \n \n \nAfter both sides had presented their evidence, Department Counsel moved to \namend SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.e to conform to the evidence. Applicant did not object, and I \ngranted the motion (Tr. 77-78). SOR \u00b6 1.a originally alleged Applicant\u2019s wife is a citizen \nof Sweden, and it was amended to allege she is a dual citizen of Sweden and Iran. SOR \n\u00b6 1.e originally alleged his mother-in-law is a dual citizen of Iran and Sweden, and it was \namended to allege his mother-in-law and father-in-law are dual citizens of Iran and \nSweden. The amendments are hand-written on the SOR. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of relevant facts \nabout Iran and Sweden (Hearing Exhibits (HX) I and II). I took administrative notice as \nrequested by Department Counsel, with no objection by Applicant. The facts \nadministratively noticed are set out below in my findings of fact. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR. His \nadmissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old senior systems integration/test engineer for a defense \ncontractor. He has held a clearance since January 1996 (Tr. 5; GX 1 at 9). He worked \nfor another federal contractor from December 1995 to May 2001. He worked for two \nprivate employers who were not federal contactors and had two periods of \nunemployment until he was hired for his current position. He has worked for his current \nemployer since March 2006. His current supervisor for the past three years describes \nhim as a quick learner, technically proficient, willing to help others, and very \nconscientious (AX B). \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant was born in Iran. He came to the U.S. in 1976 at age 16 (GX 4 at 1). \nHe received his high school diploma in 1977 and registered with the Selective Service in \nJanuary 1983 (AX C). He obtained a bachelor of computer science degree from a U.S. \nuniversity in May 1985, and a master\u2019s degree in May 1988. He became a U.S. citizen \nin July 1995. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of Iran. They brought him to the \nU.S. and then returned to Iran, leaving Applicant behind to live with his brother (Tr. 47). \nThey returned to the U.S. and became permanent residents of the U.S. in 1996 (AX D). \nThey both applied for U.S. citizenship in 2001, but their applications were rejected \nbecause they had difficulty understanding English (Tr. 40-41; AX A at 2).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father is 95 years old and a retired medical doctor who had a private \npractice in Iran. He became seriously ill in December 2001 and returned to Iran because \nof the high cost of medical care in the U.S. He has heart disease, and he is blind in one \neye and hard of hearing (AX A at 1). Applicant\u2019s mother is 86 years old and has never \nworked outside the home. She was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease in February \n2008 and has limited mobility as a result of breaking her hip in 2002. His parents know \nhe works with computers, but they do not know who he works for or that he has a \nsecurity clearance (Tr. 41-42; GX 3 at 2; AX A at 1). \n \nApplicant talks to his parents by telephone about once a month, but \ncommunication is difficult because of their age and infirmities. His mother no longer \nrecognizes him (Tr. 64). His parents own a home in Iran, but Applicant and his brothers \nwill be unable to inherit it because they would be required to travel to Iran and \npersonally claim their inheritance. Applicant believes the home probably will taken by \nthe Iranian government (Tr. 59). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s older brother came to the U.S. in 1974 and earned a master\u2019s degree \nand a doctorate. He became a U.S. citizen in December 2000 (Tr. 43; AX A at 2). He \ncurrently resides in Canada and is a professor at a Canadian university (Tr. 53).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s younger brother also came to the U.S. in 1974. He obtained a \nmaster\u2019s degree in 1979, is married to a U.S. citizen, has two sons who are U.S. \ncitizens, and is employed by a state government (Tr. 43-44) AX A at 2). He became a \nU.S. citizen in May 1991.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister was born in Iran. She moved to Spain in the early 1980s. \nApplicant had no contact with his sister after she moved to Spain and does not know \nher current whereabouts (GX 4 at 2). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife and her parents were born in Iran, moved to Sweden in 1980, \nand now are citizens of Sweden. Applicant and his wife met in December 2003, after \nshe came to the U.S., and they were married in June 2005. She is a permanent resident \nof the U.S. (AX E). All her relatives live either in the U.S. or in Sweden (Tr. 45). \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife intends to become a U.S. citizen as soon as she is eligible (Tr. 72). \nThey have a son, born in December 2006. \n \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law is a computer salesman and his mother-in-law works for \na sign company. Neither is connected to the governments of Sweden or Iran (GX 4 at \n2). \n \n \nApplicant traveled to Iran in 1999 to visit his father, who suddenly developed \nheart problems. He reported his travel to his security officer and used an Iranian \npassport. He traveled to Iran again in 2002 when his mother broke her hip. He was not \nworking for the government or a government contractor when he made this trip (AX A at \n2). He destroyed his Iranian passport in February 2008 after being advised that it raised \nsecurity concerns (GX 2 at 3). He is aware that he probably will be unable to visit his \nparents in Iran without an Iranian passport (Tr. 46-47). \n \n \nApplicant has no financial interests in Iran (GX 4 at 2). He and his brother jointly \nown a rental property in the U.S. Applicant lives in another home owned by his brother \nand pays all the household expenses except the mortgage (Tr. 67-68). He has a \nretirement account worth about $35,000 and about $4,000 in savings (Tr. 68-69). He \nvotes in U.S. elections (Tr. 70). \n \nI took administrative notice of the following adjudicative facts. Iran is a theocratic \nIslamic republic dominated by Shia Muslim clergy, with ultimate political authority vested \nin a learned religious scholar. Iran\u2019s government is hostile to the U.S. Current U.S. \nconcerns about Iran are based on its efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and weapons \nof mass destruction; support for and involvement in international terrorism; support for \nviolent opposition to the Middle East peace process; and its human rights abuses, \nincluding summary executions, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, and restrictions on \ncivil liberties.  Iran has provided guidance, training, and weapons to Shia political and \nmilitant groups in Iraq.  It also provides encouragement, training, funding, and weapons \nto anti-Israeli terrorist groups in its efforts to undermine the Arab-Israeli peace process, \nand it advocates the destruction of Israel. The U.S. has designated Iran as a state \nsponsor of terrorism. The U.S. broke diplomatic relations with Iran in April 1980, \nprohibits most trade with Iran, and uses multilateral sanctions and diplomatic pressure \nto contain the threats posed by Iran. Because Iran does not recognize dual citizenship, \nIranian-born, naturalized U.S. citizens are considered solely Iranian citizens by the \nIranian authorities, and they are required to enter and exit Iran on an Iranian passport. \nWhile traveling or residing in Iran, they are subject to surveillance, search, harassment, \narrest, and imprisonment. \n \nI also took administrative notice that Sweden is a constitutional monarchy with a \nmultiparty parliamentary government. The government generally respects the human \nrights of its citizens, and the law and judiciary provide effective redress for individual \ninstances of abuse. Sweden was neutral in World War I, followed a policy of armed \nneutrality in World War II, and it currently remains nonaligned. In 2002, Sweden refined \nits foreign policy to allow non-alignment in peacetime with the ability to cooperate with \n\n \n5 \n \n \nmilitary alliances in peacekeeping and peace-building. Friendship and cooperation \nbetween the U.S. and Sweden is strong and close.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe SOR, as amended at the hearing, alleges Applicant\u2019s spouse is a dual \ncitizen of Sweden and Iran living in the U.S. (SOR \u00b6 1.a); his father and mother are \ncitizens and residents of Iran (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and c); his two brothers are dual citizens of \nIran and the U.S. (SOR \u00b6 1.d); his mother-in-law and father-in-law are dual citizens of \nIran and Sweden (SOR \u00b6 1.e); and he traveled to Iran in December 2002 and \nNovember 1999 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). The security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \n\u00b6 6 as follows:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s travel to Iran was solely to visit his ailing parents. Except for his use \nof a foreign passport to enter and exit Iran, his foreign travel has no independent \nsecurity significance. See ISCR Case No. 02-26978 (App. Bd. Sep 21, 2005). \n \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United \nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. \nFinally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields.  See ISCR Case No. 00-\n\n \n7 \n \n \n0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the \nnature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights \nrecord are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known \nto conduct intelligence operations against the U.S. In considering the nature of the \ngovernment, an administrative judge must also consider any terrorist activity in the \ncountry at issue. See generally ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) \n(reversing decision to grant clearance where administrative judge did not consider \nterrorist activity in area where family members resided). \n \nA disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(a). A disqualifying condition \nalso may be raised by \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect \nsensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, \ngroup, or country by providing that information.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(b). The totality of an applicant\u2019s \nfamily ties to a foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be considered. \nISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003).  \n \nIran\u2019s hostility to the United States places a \u201cvery heavy burden of persuasion\u201d on \napplicant to overcome the security concerns that are raised when an applicant has \nimmediate family members living in Iran. See ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 4 (App. Bd. \nAug. 4, 2006. With its adversarial stance and its poor human rights record, it is not \nunlikely that Iran would target any citizen in an attempt to gather information from the \nUnited States. I conclude AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b) are raised by the presence of Applicant\u2019s \nparents in Iran. \n \n \nA security concern also may be raised if an applicant is \u201csharing living quarters \nwith a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a \nheightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d AG \u00b6 7(d). \nApplicant\u2019s spouse and her parents were born in Iran and are considered to be Iranian \ncitizens by that government, but they have no attachment to Iran and no family or \nfinancial ties to Iran. They are citizens of Sweden, a friendly country with a good human \nrights record. Applicant\u2019s spouse aspires to be a U.S. citizen. I conclude Applicant\u2019s \nrelationships with his spouse and her parents do not create the \u201cheightened risk\u201d \ncontemplated by AG \u00b6 7(d). \n \n \nFinally, a security concern also may be raised by \u201ca substantial business, \nfinancial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-\noperated business, which could subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign \ninfluence or exploitation.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(e). Applicant is resigned to the fact that he cannot \ninherit his parent\u2019s home in Iran, and he did not appear particularly concerned about it at \n\n \n8 \n \n \nthe hearing. There is no \u201cheightened risk\u201d because Applicant is unconcerned about the \nproperty. \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to \nthe government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are \nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is \nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of \nthe U.S.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(a). Applicant cares about his parents, and it is not unlikely that Iran \nwould target them in an attempt to gather information from the United States. I conclude \nAG \u00b6 8(a) is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is \nno conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the \nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(b). \nApplicant\u2019s loyalty, affection, and sense of obligation toward his parents are not \n\u201cminimal,\u201d but his relationships and loyalties in the U.S. are strong. He came to the U.S. \nwhen he was 16 years old and has never lived under the current regime in Iran. He has \nlived in the U.S. for 32 years. He completed high school, college, and graduate school \nin the U.S. His two brothers have lived in the U.S. since 1974, were educated in the \nU.S., and have been U.S. citizens for many years. Applicant is devoted to his spouse \nand young son. His spouse aspires to be a U.S. citizen, and his son is a native-born \ncitizen. He has held a clearance since 1996. His entire professional career has been in \nthe U.S., and he has spent much of his career working as a contractor for the U.S. \ngovernment. He made a conscious choice to destroy his Iranian passport, knowing that \ndoing so made it virtually impossible for him to visit his aged and ailing parents again. \nHis destruction of his Iranian passport demonstrated that he would resolve any conflict \nof interest in favor of the U.S. I conclude AG \u00b6 8(b) is established. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n9 \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is mature, well-educated, and intelligent. He was candid, sincere, and \ncredible at the hearing. He has spent all his adult life in the U.S. But for his parents\u2019 \nmedical problems and the high cost of medical care in the U.S., he would have no \nfamily ties to Iran. But for their difficulty with the English language, his parents would be \nU.S. citizens. His family ties to Sweden do not raise significant security concerns. He \nhas not told his parents the identity of his employer or that he holds a clearance. He has \ncarefully thought about the conflict raised by the presence of his parents in Iran, and he \nhas resolved it by destroying his passport and making it impossible for him to see his \nparents again.  \n  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline B, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \ncarried his \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d and mitigated the security concerns based on foreign \ninfluence. Accordingly, I conclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant continue his eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B (Foreign Influence):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

In\naddition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 46-year-old man who has been employed as an electronics engineer\nby a defense contractor since January 1996. He has held a secret level security clearance,\nwhen required by his employment assignments, since about 1981, and no previous\nadverse action has been taken to revoke or downgrade that clearance. Applicant was\nawarded a bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering in 1989.\nApplicant was first married in January 1993. That marriage ended in divorce in\nOctober 2000. He has two children from this marriage, ages 14 and 11, and shares\ncustody of them with his ex-wife.\nApplicant has been remarried since June 2004. He met his current wife through an\ninternet dating service in November 2002. Although the internet site he used was designed\nfor Jewish singles to meet, his wife was a resident and citizen of the People\u2019s Republic of\nChina (China) at the time. Applicant visited with her in China in March 2003, and a couple\nof times thereafter. He sponsored her entry into the U.S. on a fianc\u00e9 visa in March 2004.\nShe presently has conditional permanent resident status in the U.S. \nApplicant\u2019s wife worked as a municipal police officer in China. As such, she was\nrequired to be a member of the Communist party. Her father is a citizen and resident of\nChina and a retired municipal police officer. One of her brothers is a citizen and resident\nof China and is currently employed as a municipal police officer. Applicant presumes his\nfather-in-law and brother-in-law are members of the Communist party based upon his\nwife\u2019s required membership as a condition of her employment as a police officer.\nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a citizen and resident of China and a retired factory\nworker. He has a second brother-in-law who is a citizen and resident of China and who\nworks as an electronics salesman. His wife also has several close friends who are citizens\nand residents of China and who are employed as either police officers or civil servants.\nApplicant presumes her friends are members of the Communist party as a condition of\ntheir employment.\n\n3\nApplicant and his current wife have two children, ages two years and nine months,\nwho were born in the U.S. and are U.S. citizens. His wife has daily e-mail/webcam contact\nwith her mother, weekly contact with the brother who is a salesman, and once a month\ncontact with the brother who is a police officer. Additionally, Applicant\u2019s wife spends 90\ndays a year in China visiting with her family and close friends. She takes their children to\nChina with her while vacationing there. Applicant last vacationed in China with his wife\nabout two years ago.\nApplicant gave his Chinese parents-in-law $41,000 as a gift to purchase a home.\nThe parents-in-law gave an additional $6,000 that Applicant provided to them for the\npurchase of the house to their salesman son for use in his business. In April 2006,\nApplicant and his wife paid $103,750 to purchase a house in China for use as a potential\nretirement home. While Applicant has not definitely committed to retiring in China, he\nbelieves living there would be in his wife\u2019s best interest because she is much closer to her\nfriends and family members in China than he is to anyone in the U.S. \nApplicant and his wife attempted to start a business importing granite tiles from\nChina to resell in the U.S. With the assistance of his father-in-law, Applicant paid $14,000\nto buy and import the tiles from China. However, he has concluded he is not a very good\nsalesman and has given up on that effort for the time being. \nChina is a Communist party-led state. It has a well-documented and continuing\npractice of abusing human rights in violation of internationally recognized norms, stemming\nboth from the authorities\u2019 intolerance of dissent and the inadequacy of legal safeguards for\nbasic freedoms. (GE 3) \nThe U.S. is a primary intelligence target of China. (GE 4) Chinese espionage\nactivities in the U.S. are so extensive that they comprise the single greatest risk to the\nsecurity of American technologies. (GE 5) \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guidelines B (foreign influence) and\nC (foreign preference), with their disqualifying and mitigating conditions, are most relevant\nin this case. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n3\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n4\n Department of the Navy v.

The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n3\n4\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,5\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n6\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n7\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n8\nclearance decision.9\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n10\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n11\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n12\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has\ndivided loyalties or financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign\nperson, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is\nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this\nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign\ncontact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as\nwhether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected\ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\n\n5\nApplicant\u2019s wife is a citizen of China with conditional permanent resident status in\nthe U.S. Her parents, brothers and close friends are citizens and residents of China. Her\nfather, one brother, and close friends are, considering the requirement that she had to be\na member of the Communist party to work as a police officer, most likely either current or\nformer members of the Communist party themselves. She visits with her relatives and\nfriends in China for 90 days each year and maintains daily contact with her mother and\nregular contact with other family members and friends when she is in the U.S.   \nDisqualifying Condition (DC) 7(a): contact with a foreign family member . . . or other\nperson who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;\nand DC 7(d): sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship\nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion apply. \nApplicant has provided $41,000 to his parents-in-law for the purchase of a house\nin China. He indirectly provided an additional $6,000 to his brother-in-law. Applicant and\nhis wife have purchased a house in China to potentially use as a retirement home.\nApplicant has vacationed in China on numerous occasions, most recently about two years\nago. China is a Communist party-led state that aggressively targets the U.S. for intelligence\ncollection. \nDC 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create\na potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive\ninformation or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or\ncountry by providing that information; and DC 7(e): a substantial business, financial, or\nproperty interest in a foreign country, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business,\nwhich could subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation\napply. I have considered all mitigating conditions and conclude that none apply.\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nForeign preference is a concern because when an individual acts in such a way as\nto indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may\nbe prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the\nUnited States.\nApplicant has purchased a residence in China and may decide to reside there when\nhe retires. While he is presently uncertain if he will actually relocate to China, he believes\nthat would be in his wife\u2019s best interest because of her very close relationship with her\nfamily and friends who are citizens and residents of China. Although the record does not\ncontain information about what is required of an American citizen to purchase real estate\nin China and to permanently relocate to China, it is obvious that Applicant\u2019s ownership of\na potential retirement home in China is sufficient for application of Disqualifying Condition\n(DC) 10(a): exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship . . . through\nthe foreign citizenship of a family member. \n\n6\nApplicant\u2019s wife spends one-fourth of each year residing in China and visiting with\nher family and friends. She maintains daily contact with her mother and regular contact with\nother family members and close friends. While Applicant equivocates on whether or not\nhe will eventually relocate to China, the evidence indicates it is more likely than not that he\nwill. I have considered all mitigating conditions and conclude none apply.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d In this case, there is no reason to doubt that Applicant is a loyal American\ncitizen or suspect he would consider doing harm to the interests of the United States. Still,\nhis and his wife\u2019s contacts with China through her relatives and friends, their ownership of\nreal estate in that country, and the likelihood they will one day take up residence in China,\ncoupled with the nature and history of the Chinese government, create a security concern\nthat has not been overcome.    \nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\ntheir acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and\nthe applicable disqualifying conditions, Applicant has failed to mitigate the foreign influence\nand foreign preference security concerns that exist in this case. He has failed to overcome\nthe case against him or satisfy his ultimate burden of persuasion. Guidelines B and C are\ndecided against Applicant. It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nApplicant a security clearance. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-g:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline c:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion               \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\n_________________\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n",

DeLaney, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nMay 5, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on April 4, 2007\n(Item 5). On October 24, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) (Item 1) detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline F for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on November 16, 2007, (Item 4),\nin which she requested that her case be decided on the written record in lieu of a\nhearing. \nOn December 13, 2007, Department Counsel issued the Department's written\ncase. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to\nApplicant, and she was given the opportunity to file objections and submit material in\n\n2\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. A response was due on January 19, 2008.\nApplicant did not submit any additional evidence. The case was assigned to this\nAdministrative Judge on April 2, 2008.\nIn the FORM, Department Counsel offered seven documentary exhibits (Items 1-\n7). No documents were offered by Applicant. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her RSOR, Applicant denied every SOR allegation.\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the FORM, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of fact: \nApplicant is 50 years old. She is employed by a defense contractor, and she\nseeks a DoD security clearance in connection with her employment in the defense\nsector.\nThe SOR lists eight allegations regarding financial difficulties under Adjudicative\nGuideline F. All of the allegations will be discussed in the same order as they were listed\nin the SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $280. Applicant\ndenied that she owed this debt in her RSOR, but two credit reports (Items 6 and 7)\nestablish that this debt has been owed by Applicant.  No evidence has been introduced\nto establish that Applicant has paid this debt or it has been resolved in any way. \n1.b. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $720. Applicant\ndenied that she owed this debt in her RSOR, but two credit reports (Items 6 and 7)\nestablish that this debt has been owed by Applicant.  No evidence has been introduced\nto establish that Applicant has paid this debt or it has been resolved in any way. \n1.c. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $5,192. Applicant\ndenied that she owed this debt in her RSOR, but two credit reports (Items 6 and 7)\nestablish that this debt has been owed by Applicant.  No evidence has been introduced\nto establish that Applicant has paid this debt or it has been resolved in any way. \n1.d. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $3,649. Applicant\ndenied that she owed this debt in her RSOR, but two credit reports (Items 6 and 7)\nestablish that this debt has been owed by Applicant.  No evidence has been introduced\nto establish that Applicant has paid this debt or it has been resolved in any way. \n \n1.e. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,821. Applicant\ndenied that she owed this debt in her RSOR, but two credit reports (Items 6 and 7)\n\n3\nestablish that this debt has been owed by Applicant.  No evidence has been introduced\nto establish that Applicant has paid this debt or it has been resolved in any way. \n1.f. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $5,731.  Applicant\ndenied that she owed this debt in her RSOR, but two credit reports (Items 6 and 7)\nestablish that this debt has been owed by Applicant.  No evidence has been introduced\nto establish that Applicant has paid this debt or it has been resolved in any way. \n1.g. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $486.  Applicant\ndenied that she owed this debt in her RSOR, but two credit reports (Items 6 and 7)\nestablish that this debt has been owed by Applicant.  No evidence has been introduced\nto establish that Applicant has paid this debt or it has been resolved in any way. \n1.h. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $214. Applicant\ndenied that she owed this debt in her RSOR, but two credit reports (Items 6 and 7)\nestablish that this debt has been owed by Applicant.  No evidence has been introduced\nto establish that Applicant has paid this debt or it has been resolved in any way. \nIn her RSOR, Applicant stated that all of the debts listed in the SOR \u201cwent to\ncollections in the spring/summer of 2001\" and she explained that her financial difficulties\noccurred because when she and her husband divorced in 2000, it was her\n\u201cunderstanding\u201d that he was to pay off all of these debts. She contended that\nunbeknownst to her, her husband died in April 2001.  She wrote in her RSOR that was\nprepared on November 16, 2007, that she planned to contact the creditors to \u201cverify the\ndebt.\u201d\nNo evidence has been introduced to show that Applicant has taken any steps to\ncontact these creditors to make payments on these debts, or in any other way resolve\nthem, since her RSOR was submitted. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\n\n4\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations\nis set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.\nUnder AG \u00b6 19 (a), an Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially\ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG \u00b6  19 (c), a history of not meeting financial obligations\n\n5\nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt and was\nunable to pay some obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise\nthese potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate\ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties.\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nUnder AG \u00b6  20 (b), it may be mitigating where the conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. As noted above, the\nfinancial problems seem to have arisen primarily because Applicant\u2019s former husband\nwas to make payments on these debts, but he died without her knowledge. However,\nApplicant became aware of the overdue debts, at least since she received the SOR,\nsent to her on October 24, 2007. While Applicant indicated on her RSOR that she would\ncontact the creditors, there is no evidence that Applicant did in fact act responsibly by\ncontacting the creditors and paying off these debts. Therefore, this mitigating condition\ndoes not apply. I also find that no other Mitigating Condition is applicable in this case.\n I can not conclude that Applicant has mitigated the financial concerns or is more\nfinancially sound and better prepared for future contingencies.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited\nabove as to why no Mitigating Conditions apply, together with no additional information\nto consider about Applicant\u2019s character, I find that the record evidence leaves me with\nsignificant questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance under the whole person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant\nhas not mitigated the security concerns. \n\n6\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

SOR \u00b6 1.j and SOR \u00b6 1.k alleged the same debt. The allegations were consolidated under SOR \u00b6 1.j. His admission is incorporated herein as a finding of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 43-year-old sheet metal journeyman (ductwork installer) working for a Government contractor (Tr. 86). In 1986, he completed his Associate\u2019s Degree in computer programming (Tr. 5). He has been continuously employed as a sheet metal journeyman since 1995 for different employers (GE 1). Applicant has had only two breaks in his employment history. He was laid off in 1995 and 2000 on each occasion for a three month period (Tr. 62). He has worked for his current employer, a Government contractor, since February 2002. He has no police record, and there is no evidence he has used or trafficked in illegal drugs. 2 On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum directing application of revised Adjudicative Guidelines to all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program (Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006.

Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 9, 2005, Applicant submitted an Office of Personnel Management \nSecurity Clearance Application or Standard Form (SF) 86.1 On December 21, 2007, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nto him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within \nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \n \n1  GE 1.  \n \nAugust 26, 2006\n\n \n \n2 \n \n                                                          \nProgram (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.2 The \nSOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make \nthe preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended \nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, denied, or revoked. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 15, 2008, and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on February 14, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 26, 2008. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled on March 14, 2008. The government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 4, which were admitted without objection (Tr. 21). Applicant testified on his own \nbehalf, and presented no witnesses or documentary evidence (Tr. 23). DOHA received \nthe transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 24, 2008.  \n \nProcedural Issues \n \nThe Government elected not to pursue, and presented no evidence, concerning \nthe allegations in SOR \u00b6 2 (Tr. 14-15). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant denied all the SOR allegations with the exception of SOR \u00b6 1.o, which \nhe admitted with an explanation. SOR \u00b6 1.j and SOR \u00b6 1.k alleged the same debt. The \nallegations were consolidated under SOR \u00b6 1.j. His admission is incorporated herein as \na finding of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make \nthe following additional findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old sheet metal journeyman (ductwork installer) working \nfor a Government contractor (Tr. 86). In 1986, he completed his Associate\u2019s Degree in \ncomputer programming (Tr. 5). He has been continuously employed as a sheet metal \njourneyman since 1995 for different employers (GE 1). Applicant has had only two \nbreaks in his employment history. He was laid off in 1995 and 2000 on each occasion \nfor a three month period (Tr. 62). He has worked for his current employer, a \nGovernment contractor, since February 2002. He has no police record, and there is no \nevidence he has used or trafficked in illegal drugs. \n \n \n \n \n2  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guidelines to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \nApplicant has been married twice. He married his first wife in 1986, and they \nwere divorced in 1992. He has a 21-year-old son of this marriage, who is attending \ncollege. Applicant does not contribute financially to his son\u2019s college education. He \nmarried his current wife in 1995. She has medical problems related to her diabetic \ncondition, and a stroke she suffered in 2001 (Tr. 63). After her stroke, his wife was \nunemployed for six months. She tried to go back to work in 2002, but she never fully \nrecovered and her medical condition did not allow her to go back to work (Tr. 72, 94-\n95). She also suffers from gout; bone spurs, and is blind in one eye (Tr. 65). \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife was sick again in 2004. She was unable to work for two years \nand had no earnings. She applied for social security disability payments, but it took her \ntwo years to receive her payments. During his wife\u2019s unemployment, Applicant has been \nforced to use his credit cards to pay for his wife\u2019s medications\u2013approximately $350 a \nmonth insurance co-payment, and their day-to-day living expenses. His wife receives \n$1,200 a month in social security disability payments, and $175 monthly retired pay \nfrom her prior employer (Tr. 64). \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed his financial situation and \nincluded the review of his SF 86, and three credit bureau reports (CBRs) from \nSeptember 2005 (GE 2), October 2007 (GE 3), and January 2008 (GE 4). The SOR \nalleges 13 delinquent/charged off accounts totaling approximately $98,000.  \n \nApplicant has disputed most of the debts alleged in the SOR for several reasons. \nConcerning SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($9,439), 1.c ($12,444), 1.d ($23,209), 1.e ($2,792), 1.f \n($13,313), 1.g, ($8,494), 1.h ($47), 1.l ($6,631), and 1.m ($7,082), Applicant explained \nthese were his credit card debts which became delinquent because of his three month \nperiod of unemployment in 2000, and his wife\u2019s inability to work after 2001 due to her \nsevere medical problems. He claimed his financial problems were aggravated in \nOctober 2004 because of the additional expenses created by his wife\u2019s medical \ncondition and her inability to work and contribute to the household finances. \n \nIn 2004, Applicant and his wife went on a week vacation to Florida. When they \nreturned, he did not have the money to pay for many of his credit card debts and missed \npayments. The creditors imposed over the limit fees, late fees, and raised the interest \nrate on his credit card debts. Applicant became upset and refused to pay the principal or \nany additional credit card charges. The debts have been in collection or sold to different \ncollection agencies. Applicant admitted most of the debts alleged in the SOR were \noriginally his debts. He is disputing the total of the debts (limit fees, late fees, and high \ninterest rates) and challenging the collecting agencies\u2019 ownership of his debts because \nhe does not recognize the creditors (Tr. 24, 70-72). \n \nHe disputed SOR \u00b6 1.a and the creditor requested arbitration to resolve the \ndispute (Tr. 29-32). He also disputed SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and 1.m and the creditors filed suit \nagainst Applicant to recover the debts. Applicant retained counsel to represent him in \n\n \n \n4 \n \nthese legal proceedings in April 2004. Applicant stated that if he were to lose the suit, \nhis wife would give him the money to pay the debts from her inheritance money. SOR \u00b6 \n1.b alleged a $158 medical bill; however, the provider, creditor or debt holder is not \nidentified. Applicant has no means to determine whether this is his debt or whether the \ndebt is valid. He promised he would take care of the debt if he could identify the \nprovider (Tr. 32-33). Applicant claimed he settled the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i ($2,073) \nin December 2007 (Tr. 39-40).  \n \nRegarding SOR \u00b6 1.h ($47), he claimed the telephone service provider promised \nto give him credit for lack of services and did not follow through with his promise (Tr. \n38). Concerning the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j ($12,439), Applicant claimed he did not \nrecognize the creditor and that this was not his debt. Regarding SOR \u00b6 1.n ($312), he \nclaimed he had a contractual dispute with the telephone service provider.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s take home pay is around $3,200 a month without overtime. He works \novertime whenever he can; however, the overtime opportunities fluctuate and he has no \ncontrol over it (Tr. 46-47). His monthly expenses are as follows (Tr. 50-52): $600 \nmortgage (he is current on his payments); $200 home owners association fees; $300 \nutilities (gas and electricity); $800 food; and $400 commuting expenses. He has \napproximately $60,000 in a 401(k) retirement plan (Tr. 54). As of the hearing date, \nApplicant was carrying three credit cards: an American Express card owing $8,000; a \nVisa with no balance; and a Costco credit card with a $1,200 balance (Tr. 98). Applicant \nand his wife have three paid off vehicles. He drives a 1999 Tahoe. His wife drives a \n1999 Mercury Grand Marquis and a 2006 Scion XB (Tr. 100). He has approximately \n$100 monthly remaining after paying his day-to-day living expenses (Tr. 100).   \n \nIn addition to owning his home, Applicant owns two time share properties. He \nbought the first time share property in 2002 (Tr. 57) for a closing fee of $3,000 (Tr. 77). \nHe bought the second time share in South Africa in 2003 for $1.000. He pays \napproximately $1,000 a year in maintenance fees for both time share properties (Tr. \n78). He exchanges his time shares for vacation time in other vacation resorts. Since \npurchasing his time share properties in 2002-2003, Applicant and his wife have been on \nvacation at least three weeks a year during 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006. In 2007, \nthey vacationed for two weeks (Tr. 78). \n \nIn 2007, Applicant sought the advice of a bankruptcy attorney seeking to resolve \nhis debts. However, he was advised that filing for bankruptcy protection would not be in \nhis best interests (Tr. 68, 75). He has retained counsel to represent him in two pending \nlaw suits from creditors. Notwithstanding, Applicant testified he has not participated in \nany financial counseling. At most, the financial counseling he has received is quite \nlimited. He presented no budget or plans to pay his delinquent debts. Applicant believes \nmost of his delinquent debts are time-barred, and he intends to rely on the statute of \nlimitations to resolve his debts (Tr. 75). He also claimed he looked into consolidating his \ndebts, but did not pursue the consolidation because he did not trust the consumer credit \ncounseling company (Tr. 96).  \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \n                                                          \nApplicant was advised not to make any payments on his old debts because that \nwould reaffirm his debts and begin anew the statute of limitations (Tr. 115). He is \nwaiting for his creditors to bring suit against him to then resolve the delinquent debts in \ncourt. He averred he is working on resolving his delinquent debts, but that it will take \nsome time. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d3 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \n3  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n                                                          \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).4 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the relevant security concern is under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is well documented in his credit reports and his \ntestimony. As of the hearing date, he had 11 outstanding debts totaling approximately \n$95,700. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and \n19(c).   \n \n \n4  \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n \n7 \n \n                                                          \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,5 I conclude that none of the \nmitigating conditions apply. Applicant presented little evidence of good-faith efforts \ntaken to contact creditors, or to resolve his debts since he acquired them. Although \nthere is evidence that he has participated in some financial counseling (consulting with \na bankruptcy attorney and the attorney representing him in the law suits), there are no \nindications that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are being resolved or are under control.  \n \nI specifically considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition AG \u00b6 \n20(b): \u201cThe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances\u201d, and conclude it applies, but only to a limited extent.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s testimony established factors that may be considered as \ncircumstances beyond his control contributing to his inability to pay his debts, i.e., his \ntwo three month periods of unemployment; his wife\u2019s medical condition and the financial \nexpenses associated with it; the lack of financial assistance from his wife; and the bad \n \n5  See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 \nat 4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for AG \u00b6 20(a), all debts are considered \nas a whole. \n\n \n \n8 \n \ndecision to purchase and retain two time share properties as well as taking vacations \nthat were unaffordable.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to show he has dealt responsibly with his \nfinancial obligations before, or especially after receipt of the SOR. Applicant has been \nconsistently employed, except for two three month periods he was laid off in 1995 and \n2000. Since 2002, he has continuously worked for his current employer. He presented \nlittle evidence to show paid debts, settlements, documented negotiations, payment \nplans, budgets, or financial assistance/counseling. Applicant\u2019s financial history and lack \nof favorable evidence preclude a finding that he has established a track record of \nfinancial responsibility, or that he has taken control of his financial situation. Based on \nthe available evidence, he is overextended financially because of his failure or inability \nto live within his means. His financial problems are recent, not isolated, and are likely to \nbe a concern in the future. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). \nApplicant\u2019s years of working for Government contractors weighs in his favor. He \nis considered a valued employee. Aside from his delinquent debts (which are a civil, \nnon-criminal issue), he is a law-abiding citizen, a good father, and loving husband. He \nexpressed regrets for his financial mistakes and claimed he is trying to correct them.  \n \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances in his case, including Applicant\u2019s \nage, education, maturity, his years working for the Government contractors, he \ndemonstrated a lack of judgment and trustworthiness in the handling of his financial \naffairs. He failed to deal responsibly with his financial obligations, especially after receipt \nof the SOR. His failure or inability to live within his means and to meet his financial \nobligations indicates poor self-control or an unwillingness to abide by rules and \n\n \n \n9 \n \nregulations. His behavior raises questions about his reliability, and ability to protect \nclassified information.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has failed to \nmitigate the security concerns pertaining to financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a; 1.c- 1.h; \n \nAgainst Applicant \n1.j; and 1.l \u2013 1.o: \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b; 1.i; and 1.k:  \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:    \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJuan J. Rivera \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Department Counsel filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s application\nof the Guideline B and C mitigating conditions was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding\nerror, we reverse.  \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nApplicant was born in Iran and immigrated to the U.S. in the late 1990s.  She became a\nnaturalized U.S. citizen in 2005.  Her mother is a naturalized U.S. citizen and her father is in the final\nstages of obtaining such citizenship.  Applicant\u2019s sister is a citizen and resident of Iran, although she\n\u201chas been approved for her visa to immigrate to the U.S. . . . . Applicant has regular contact with her\nsister.\u201d  Decision at 2.  Her maternal grandparents are citizens and residents of Iran.  Since\nimmigrating to the U.S., Applicant has traveled to Iran approximately annually, mostly to visit her\nsister.  She has a U.S. passport and holds an Iranian passport as well.  The Iranian passport expires\nin late 2009.  Each time she has visited Iran, she has used her Iranian passport, even following her\nattainment of U.S. citizenship.  \u201cInitially, she expressed an intent to retain her Iranian passport . . .\nbut in her answer stated a willingness to surrender it.  At hearing, she revealed that she has begun\nthe process of surrendering her Iranian passport to Iranian authorities . . .\u201d  Id.  \nIran is a fundamentalist Islamic republic with a poor human rights record.  It is a sponsor of\ninternational terrorism and supports violent opposition to the Middle East peace process.  U.S\ncitizens may be subject to harassment or arrest while traveling in Iran, and those of Iranian origin\nrisk being targeted by authorities.  \nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give\ndeference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.\n\nU.S. Department of State Background Note: Iran, March 2008, at 9.  \n1\nMessage of the President to the Congress of the United States, March 11, 2008: \u201cThe actions and policies of\n2\nthe Government of Iran are contrary to the interests of the United States in the region and pose a continuing unusual and\nextraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States . . . I have determined that\n3\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3. \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nThe Judge made a sustainable conclusion that the totality of the record evidence establishes\nsecurity concerns under Guidelines B and C.  However, Department Counsel argues that the Judge\nerred in his further conclusion that Applicant had met her burden of persuasion as to mitigation. The\nBoard notes Official Notice documents describing the challenges posed to the U.S. by Iran, including\nits efforts to develop WMD;  the President\u2019s establishment of a state of emergency to address these\n1\nproblems;  and efforts of the Iranian government to monitor the private activities of citizens.\n2\n3\n\nit is necessary to continue the national emergency declared with respect to Iran and maintain in force comprehensive\nsanctions against Iran to respond to this threat.\u201d  \nSee U.S. Department of State Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, March 11, 2008, at 9: \u201cSecurity\n3\nforces monitored the social activities of citizens, entered homes and offices, monitored telephone conversations and\ninternet communications, and opened mail without court authorization.\u201d\n4\nApplicant presented no exhibits at the hearing, nor did she file a brief on appeal.  Given the security\nconcerns posed by the presence of Applicant\u2019s relatives in Iran and the paucity of mitigating\nevidence, the record as a whole does not support a conclusion that Applicant has met her burden of\npersuasion as to mitigation.  Accordingly, the Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is not\nsustainable.   \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Applicant answered the SOR 24 May 2008, and requested a hearing. DOHA\n1\nassigned the case to me 26 June 2008, and I convened a hearing 31 July 2008. DOHA\nreceived the transcript (Tr.) 8 August 2008.\n \nSeptember 30, 2008\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the allegations of the SOR, except for SOR 1.b. She is a 28-\nyear-old system engineer assistant employed by a defense contractor since December\n2005. She has not previously held a clearance. \nApplicant was born in Iran in June 1980. In 1998, when she was 18 years old,\nshe immigrated to the U.S. with her parents to have a better life. She became a\nnaturalized U.S. citizen in February 2005, and obtained her U.S. passport in March\n2005. Her mother became a naturalized U.S. citizen in April 2006. Her father is the final\nstages of obtaining his U.S. citizenship. Applicant\u2019s older sister, a housewife, has been\napproved for her visa to immigrate to the U.S., and expects to arrive in the U.S. in\nDecember 2008 or January 2009. Applicant has regular contact with her sister.\nApplicant\u2019s maternal grandparents, retired rug merchants, are dual citizens of the U.S.\nand Iran, who currently reside six months in Iran and six months in the U.S. every year.\nWhen they are in the U.S., they live with Applicant\u2019s uncle in another state. They are\nplanning to move permanently to either the U.S. or Germany in the near future.\nWhen Applicant immigrated to the U.S., she began taking computer science\ncourses through an on-line university in Iran. She studied on-line from September 1998\nthrough March 2001, obtaining her undergraduate degree. She attended graduate\nschool in the U.S. from January 2003 to July 2005, obtaining her master\u2019s degree in\nreliability engineering. Applicant has real estate holdings and other assets in the U.S.\nvalued at $800,000. She has no financial interests in Iran, and no family members in\nIran other than mentioned above. Applicant is unmarried and has no children, but she is\nthe sole support for her parents who live with her.\nApplicant immigrated to the U.S. on an Iranian passport, and renewed it, as\nrequired by U.S. immigration law, in December 2004. Her current Iranian passport does\nnot expire until December 2009. Initially, she expressed an intent to retain her Iranian\npassport (G.E. 2), but in her answer stated a willingness to surrender it. At hearing, she\nrevealed that she has begun the process of surrendering her Iranian passport to Iranian\nauthorities, a process that requires her to be interviewed by Iranian authorities in the\nU.S. \nSince immigrating to the U.S. in 1998, Applicant has returned to Iran about\nannually, mostly to visit her sister. Two extended trips in spring 2000 and spring 2001\nwere necessary to sort out issues with her on-line credits at her on-line university. All\nthese trips except the August 2006 trip, occurred before she obtained U.S. citizenship.\nShe used her Iranian passport to enter and exit Iran each time, including 2006. She\nunderstands the potential consequences to her if she retains or renews her Iranian\npassport.\nIran is a fundamentalist Islamic republic with a poor human rights record. Its\nrelations with the U.S. are confrontational and unlikely to improve given Iran\u2019s efforts to\nacquire nuclear weapons, its sponsorship of, support for, and involvement in,\n\n3\ninternational terrorism, and its support for violent opposition to the Middle East peace\nprocess. Nevertheless, Iran is not a known collector of U.S. intelligence or sensitive\neconomic information, nor is it known to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected\ninformation. \nTravel to Iran remains problematic. The Department of State\u2019s May 2007 Travel\nWarning continues to warn U.S. citizens to carefully consider the risks of travel to Iran,\nnoting that dual national Iranian-American citizens may encounter difficulty in departing\nIran. Some elements of the Iranian government and population remain hostile to the\nU.S. Consequently, American citizens may be subject to harassment or arrest while\ntraveling or residing in Iran. Americans of Iranian origin are urged to consider the risk of\nbeing targeted by authorities before planning travel to Iran. In addition, Iranian\nauthorities may deny dual nationals access to the U.S. Interests Section in Tehran,\nbecause they are considered to be solely Iranian citizens. Large-scale demonstrations\nhave taken place in various regions throughout Iran over the past several years as a\nresult of a sometimes volatile political climate. U.S. citizens who travel to Iran despite\nthe travel warning are urged to exercise caution.\nThe U.S. government does not currently have diplomatic or consular relations\nwith the Islamic Republic of Iran, and, therefore, cannot provide protection or routine\nconsular services to American citizens in Iran. The Swiss government, acting through its\nEmbassy in Tehran, serves as protecting power for U.S. interests in Iran. Neither U.S.\npassports nor visas to the United States are issued in Tehran. The Iranian government\ndoes not recognize dual citizenship and generally does not permit the Swiss to provide\nprotective services for U.S. citizens who are also Iranian nationals. In addition, U.S.\ncitizens of Iranian origin who are considered by Iran to be Iranian citizens have been\ndetained and harassed by Iranian authorities.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guideline\nB (Foreign Influence) and Guideline C (Foreign Preference).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 6.\n3\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 7.(a).\n4\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 7.(b).\n5\n4\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline B (Foreign Influence), an applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and\ninterests may raise security concerns if the individual 1) has divided loyalties or foreign\nfinancial interests, 2) may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group,\norganization, or government in a way contrary to U.S. interests, or 3) is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Foreign influence adjudications can and\nshould consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located\u2014including, but not limited to, whether the country is known\nto target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.  Evaluation of an individual\u2019s qualifications for access to protected information\n3\nrequires careful assessment of both the foreign entity\u2019s willingness and ability to target\nprotected information, and to target ex-patriots who are U.S. citizens to obtain that\ninformation, and the individual\u2019s susceptibility to influence, whether negative or positive.\nMore specifically, an individual\u2019s contacts with foreign family members (or other foreign\nentities or persons) raise security concerns only if those contacts create a heightened\nrisk or foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  Security\n4\nconcerns may also be raised if there are connections to a foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the\nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s\ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information.5\nApplicant has frequent and close contact with her sister who is a resident citizen\nof Iran. However, her sister has been approved for her visa to immigrate to the U.S. as\na legal permanent resident, and she intends to immigrate to the U.S. as soon as she\nobtains her visa. Applicant is similarly close to her grandparents, who are citizens of the\nU.S. who intend to leave Iran permanently soon. However, none of them are connected\n\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 8.(a).\n6\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 8.(b).\n7\n5\nin any way to the Iranian government. In addition, while Applicant has traveled to Iran\nfrequently in past years, she now understands the potential consequences for her\nclearance if she resumes travel to Iran. Under Guideline B, the mere existence of a\nforeign family member is not sufficient. The nature of Applicant\u2019s contact with the family\nmember must be examined to determine whether it creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \u201cHeightened\u201d is a relative\nterm denoting increased risk over some normally existing risk that can be said to be\ninherent anytime a family member lives subject to a foreign government. One factor that\nheightens the risk in Applicant\u2019s case is the nature of the Iranian government and its\nhostility towards the United States.\nIn assessing Applicant\u2019s potential for foreign influence, I have considered the\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interest of\nthe U.S.  I have also considered whether there is no conflict of interest, either because\n6\nthe individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government,\nor country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of\ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest.7\nUnder the old adjudicative guidelines, a disqualifying condition based on foreign\nfamily members could not be mitigated unless an applicant could establish that the\nfamily members were not \u201cin a position to be exploited.\u201d Thus, an administrative judge\ncould not apply a balancing test to assess the extent of the security risk. Under the new\nguidelines, however, the potentially conflicting loyalties may be weighed to determine if\nan applicant can be expected to resolve any conflict in favor of the U.S. interest.\nThe nature of the government of Iran, its disregard for human rights, and its\npursuit of nuclear weapons place a heavy burden on Applicant in mitigating the\ndisqualifying conditions and the security concerns. Countering that somewhat is the fact\nthat Iran is not a known collector of U.S. information. Applicant has close relationships\nwith her parents and brother. However, given their lack of connection to the Iranian\ngovernment, it is highly unlikely that there could be a circumstance where Applicant is\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of her family and the\ngovernment of Iran or interests of the United States because of the nature of the Iranian\ngovernment. \nApplicant\u2019s sense of loyalty is demonstrably to the U.S. She has little if any sense\nof loyalty to Iran. She left Iran for a better life 10 years ago, and has established her\nroots in the U.S. She completed her education here and purchased property here. Her\n\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 10.(a) exercise of any right, privilege, or obligation of foreign citizenship\n8\nafter becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member. This included but is not\nlimited to: (1) possession of a current foreign passport;\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 11.(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in\n9\na foreign country;\n\u00b6 11.(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship;\n10\n\u00b6 11. (c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship occurred before the individual\n11\nbecame a U.S. citizen or when the individual was a minor;\n6\nsense of loyalty or obligation is not to Iran but to the United States. A conflict of interest\nin this case is extremely unlikely. In balancing all of the factors mentioned and\nconsidered above, I am satisfied Applicant\u2019s loyalty to the United States is such that she\ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States.\nAccordingly, Applicant has met her heavy burden to show that her contacts with her\nfamily in Iran do not cause a security concern. I conclude Applicant has mitigated\nsecurity concerns rising from her contact with her family in Iran. I resolve Guideline B for\nApplicant.\nThe government also established a case for disqualification under Guideline C by\nshowing that Applicant retained her Iranian passport after becoming a U.S. citizen in\nFebruary 2005 and obtaining her U.S. passport the following month. She used her\nIranian passport\u2014albeit without any knowledge of the security significance\u2014to enter\nand exit Iran in August 2006.8\nApplicant has mitigated the Guideline C security concerns. Although she has\nbeen a dual citizen of Iran and the United States since her naturalization as a U.S.\ncitizen, her Iranian citizenship would have little security significance if based solely on\nher parents\u2019 citizenship. For her conduct to fall within the security concerns of Guideline\nC, she must have acted in a way to indicate a preference for a foreign nation over the\nUnited States. However, inimical intent or detrimental impact on the interests of the\nUnited States is not required before the government can seek to deny access under\nGuideline C. The government has a compelling interest in ensuring those entrusted with\nthis nation's secrets will make decisions free of concerns for the foreign country of which\nthey may also be a citizen.\n \nStrictly speaking, Applicant does not fully meet the mitigating conditions (MC) for\nforeign preference. Her dual citizenship is largely based solely on her parents\u2019\ncitizenship, but is based partly on her active exercise of dual citizenship after being born\na U.S. citizen, however unwitting it may have been.  She has not expressed a\n9\nwillingness to renounce her foreign citizenship, although she has expressed, and acted\nupon, a willingness to surrender her passport.  All exercise of dual citizenship occurred\n10\nafter she obtained U.S. citizenship, while she was an adult.  Applicant's use of her\n11\nIranian passport has not been formally sanctioned by the U.S., although State\nDepartment guidance generally warns dual Iran/U.S. citizens to take precautionary\n\n\u00b6 11.(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security authority;\n12\n\u00b6 11.(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise\n13\ninvalidated; \n7\nmeasures with their Iranian passport, implicitly approving their use.  She has taken\n12\nsteps to surrender her passport, with the resultant inability to travel to Iran.  On balance\n13\nApplicant has demonstrated that she can be counted on to always act in preference to\nthe United States.

Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 29, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him,1 pursuant to Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as \namended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended, modified and revised.2 The SOR alleges security concerns under \n \n1Item 1 (Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated Nov. 29, 2007). Item I is the source for the facts in \nthe remainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise. \n \n2On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nApril 15, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nGuidelines H (Drug Involvement) and E (Personal Conduct). The SOR detailed reasons \nwhy DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance, \nand recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations on December 29, 2007, and elected \nto have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of \nthe file of relevant material (FORM), dated January 17, 2008, was provided to him on \nJanuary 30, 2008, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.3 Applicant\u2019s response was due on \nMarch 2, 2008. Applicant did not respond to the FORM. The case was assigned to me \non April 7, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact4 \n \nApplicant admitted in his response to the SOR all of the SOR\u2019s allegations. His \nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough \nreview of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is a 30-year-old accountant.5 In 1999 he received a bachelors degree \nand in May 2002 he received a Masters Degree in Professional Accountancy and a \nMasters Degree in Business Administration. He has no military service. He has never \nmarried. He was employed from 1995 to 2002 as a cheerleading instructor and coach \nand after 2002 he has been employed as an accountant.      \n \nDrug Involvement (Guideline H) \n \nOn his March 8, 2007, security clearance application, Applicant admitted using \nmarijuana 25 times between March 1999 and March 8, 2007 (Item 6). He also admitted \nusing ecstasy or MDMA an estimated 45 times from 1999 to 2005.  From March 1999 to \nMay 2002 he used ecstasy once a month, and from May 2002 to July 2005 he used \necstasy once a year (Item 7 at 5-6). He used marijuana from March 1999 until June \n \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n3Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter, is dated Jan. 22, 2008; \nhowever, Applicant\u2019s receipt is signed and dated January 30, 2008. The DOHA transmittal letter informed \nApplicant that he had 30 days after Applicant\u2019s receipt to submit information. \n \n4 Item 3, Applicant\u2019s SOR response, notarized Dec. 29, 2007, is the source for the facts in this \nsection unless stated otherwise.  There are minor inconsistencies in Applicant\u2019s descriptions of the \nfrequency of his drug use.  Compare Item 3 and Item 7 at 5-6. \n  \n5Item 4 (Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP), dated Mar. 8, 2007, will \nbe referred to as a security clearance application in this decision) is the source for the facts in this \nparagraph, unless otherwise stated.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \n2007 (Item 3, Item 7 at 3, 6). He stopped using marijuana in June 2007 because an \ninvestigator told him he had to stop using marijuana to be granted a clearance (Item 3, \nItem 7 at 6).   \n \nApplicant purchased, sold and transported ecstasy with varying frequency from \nMarch 1999 until at least April 2003. He continues to associate with individuals who use \nmarijuana in his presence (Item 3, Item 7 at 6).    \n \nPersonal Conduct (Guideline E) \n \n \nIn April 2006, Applicant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol \n(DUI) (Item 6 at 25-26, Item 3). On December 6, 2006, he was convicted of DUI and \nsentenced to 30 days in jail, with 30 days suspended, and ordered to attend alcohol \nawareness classes and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. His driver\u2019s license was \nsuspended for one year, until approximately December 5, 2007.    \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d6 \n \n6 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less \nthan the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the \nevidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).7 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \nDrug Involvement (Guideline H) \n \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the security concern concerning drug8 involvement: \n \nFederal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but \nless than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. \n1994). \n \n7 \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n \n8AG \u00b6 24(a) defines \u201cdrugs\u201d as substances that alter mood and behavior, including: \n \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the \nControlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, \ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other \nsimilar substances. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n \n[u]se of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nTwo drug involvement disqualifying conditions could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201cany drug abuse\u201d9 and \u201cillegal drug possession, \nincluding . . .  purchase, sale or distribution [of illegal drugs]. . . .\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c). \nThe other six disqualifying conditions listed in AG \u00b6 25 are not applicable. These two \ndisqualifying conditions apply because Applicant used and possessed marijuana and/or \necstasy from 1999 to June 2007. He used marijuana at least once after applying for a \nsecurity clearance, but did not use marijuana after receiving a clearance.  \n \n  \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of these three disqualifying \nconditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove \nmitigation. AG \u00b6 26 provides for potentially applicable drug involvement mitigating \nconditions:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and,  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance \nfor any violation. \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand \n \n \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are contained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n812(c). Marijuana and ecstasy or 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine are Schedule I controlled \nsubstances. See Sch. I (c)(9) and I(c)(10), respectively.  See also Gonzales v. Raish, 545 U.S. 1 (2005) \n(discussing placement of marijuana on Schedule I); United States v. Crawford, 449 F.3d 860, 861 (8th Cir. \n2006) (ecstasy).    \n \n9 AG \u00b6 24(b) defines \u201cdrug abuse\u201d as \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner \nthat deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d \n \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n \nSecurity concerns can be mitigated based on AG \u00b6 26(a) by showing that the \ndrug offenses happened so long ago, were so infrequent, or happened under such \ncircumstances that they are unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. There are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for \ndetermining when conduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be based \u201con a careful \nevaluation of the totality of the record within the parameters set by the directive.\u201d  ISCR \nCase No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). For example, the Appeal Board \ndetermined in ISCR Case No. 98-0608 (App. Bd.

His overall illegal drug \nuse lasted approximately eight years, and involved numerous uses of marijuana, and \necstasy.11 Moreover, he did not provide any corroboration that his drug use ended.12 \n \n10 ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). In ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. \nBd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board reversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the \nabsence of drug use for five years prior to the hearing.  The Appeal Board determined that the judge \nexcessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 plus years of drug \nuse, and gave too little weight to lifestyle changes and therapy.  For the recency analysis the Appeal \nBoard stated:  \n \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although the passage \nof three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did not, standing alone, compel \nthe Administrative Judge to apply Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of \nlaw, the Judge erred by failing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply \nthat mitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) with ISCR \nCase No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe Administrative Judge articulated a \nrational basis for why she had doubts about the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at \nalcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) (citation format corrections added). \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-11392 at 1-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2006) the Appeal Board, considered the recency \nanalysis of an Administrative Judge stating: \n \nThe Administrative Judge made sustainable findings as to a lengthy and serious history \nof improper or illegal drug use by a 57-year-old Applicant who was familiar with the \nsecurity clearance process.  That history included illegal marijuana use two to three times \na year from 1974 to 2002 [drug use ended four years before hearing].  It also included the \nillegal purchase of marijuana and the use of marijuana while holding a security clearance. \n \n11 In ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 8 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004), the Appeal Board reversed an \nunfavorable security clearance decision because the Administrative Judge failed to explain why drug use \nwas not mitigated after the passage of more than six years from the previous drug abuse.  \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nletely restored.   \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nHis failure to present corroboration about his rehabilitation from medical and/or \npsychiatric personnel, co-workers, neighbors, family or friends is a factor in this \ndecision.13 Based on all the facts and circumstances, he has not met his burden of \nestablishing that his drug use will not recur.

Although he has abstained from drug abuse since June 2007, \nhe did not provide \u201ca signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance \nfor any violation.\u201d Guideline \u00b6 26(b) is not applicable.  \nAG \u00b6 26(c) is not applicable because his abuse of marijuana and Ecstasy did not \nfollow an illness, and these illegal drugs were never prescribed for him. AG \u00b6 26(d) is \nnot applicable because he has not completed a prescribed drug treatment program, and \nthere has not been a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional.  \nI find For Applicant on SOR \u00b6 1.d because the same marijuana use is alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d.  Drug use after completing a security clearance application is not a \ndisqualifying condition. As such, SOR \u00b6 1.d is an unwarranted duplication. I also find For \nApplicant on SOR \u00b6 1.e because association with drug users is not a disqualifying \ncondition.    \nIn conclusion, Applicant ended his drug abuse in June 2007. Although the \nmotivations to stop using drugs are evident,14 he did not disclose any internal motivation \naside from wanting a security clearance to refrain from drug abuse. He has not shown or \ndemonstrated a sufficient track record of no drug abuse.   \n \n \n12 See whole person analysis, infra. See ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2, 3 (App. Bd.

Feb. 16, 2006). Moreover, a judge may consider \u201cApplicant\u2019s failure to \npresent documentary evidence in corroboration of his denials and explanations.\u201d ISCR Case 01-20579 at \n5 (App. Bd. Apr. 14, 2004) (holding Applicant\u2019s failure to provide reasonably available corroborative \nevidence may be used in common-sense evaluation to determine whether Applicant\u2019s claims are \nestablished). In ISCR Case 01-02677 at 7 (App. Bd. Oct. 17, 2002), the Appeal Board explained: \n \nWhile lack of corroboration can be a factor in evaluating the reliability or weight of \nevidence, lack of corroboration does not automatically render a piece of evidence \nsuspect, unreliable, or incredible. . . . Evidence that lacks corroboration must be \nevaluated in terms of its intrinsic believability and in light of all the other evidence of \nrecord, including evidence that tends to support it as well as evidence that tends to \ndetract from it.   \n \n14Retention of a security clearance, potential criminal liability for possession of drugs and adverse \nhealth, employment, and personal effects resulting from drug use are among the strong motivations for \nremaining drug free.  \n  \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nPersonal Conduct (Guideline E) \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nWith respect to his possession and use of illegal drugs, and his DUI arrest, \nconviction, and sentence, including suspension of his driver\u2019s license, AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d)(1), \n16(d)(3), and 16(e)(1) are the three pertinent disqualifying conditions:  \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: (1) untrustworthy or unreliable \nbehavior .  .  .; [and] (3) a pattern of .  .  . rule violations; [and] \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d)(1) and 16(d)(3) do not apply because his drug abuse and DUI are  \nexplicitly covered under Guidelines J (Criminal Conduct), G (Alcohol Consumption) and/or \nH (Drug Involvement). As such, the recapitulation of his drug offenses and DUI under \nGuideline E is unwarranted. \n \nCertainly possession and use of illegal drugs and DUI violates important civil and \ncriminal rules in our society, and his lengthy history of involvement with illegal drugs is \nconduct a person might wish to conceal as it adversely affects a person\u2019s professional \nand community standing. The mitigating condition outlined in AG \u00b6 17(e) applies with \nrespect to his drug possession and use, as well as his DUI. Applicant\u2019s supervisor and \nsecurity officials are well aware of this misconduct. He has taken the positive step of \ndisclosure, eliminating his vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation or duress. I do not \nbelieve he would compromise national security to avoid public disclosure of this \nmisconduct. The personal conduct security concerns, pertaining to his drug possession \nand use, as well as his DUI, are mitigated, and I find For Applicant on SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and \n2.b.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nAG \u00b6 16(g) indicates \u201cassociation with persons involved in criminal activity,\u201d is a \ndisqualifying condition.  Applicant admits he has continued his association with marijuana \nusers, and therefore AG \u00b6 16(g) applies to this conduct. None of the mitigating conditions \nunder Guideline E apply to his continuing association with drug users. Accordingly, I find \nAgainst Applicant on SOR \u00b6 2.c.  \n \nWhole Person Concept15 \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.     \nApplicant has earned advanced degrees. He was employed from 1995 to 2002 \nas a cheerleading instructor and coach, and after 2002 he has been employed as an \naccountant without evidence of any at work disciplinary problems.  There is no evidence \nof disloyalty or that he would intentionally violate national security. This shows some \nresponsibility, rehabilitation and mitigation. \n \nThe evidence against approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial. He \nused marijuana 25 times between March 1999 and June 2007. He also used ecstasy an \nestimated 45 times from 1999 to 2005.  His marijuana use continued after he filled out \nhis security clearance application, and did not end until an investigator told him his \ncontinued marijuana use would jeopardize his security clearance. He continues to \nassociate with individuals who use marijuana in his presence. In April 2006, Applicant \nwas arrested for DUI. On December 6, 2006, he was convicted and sentenced for the \nApril 2006 DUI. His drug use and DUI were knowledgeable, voluntary, and not isolated. \nHe is sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for his conduct. Drug use and DUI are \nnot prudent or responsible. He did not receive counseling or therapy, and may not have \na clear understanding about how to avoid problematic situations and why he engaged in \n \n15 Although I find For Applicant with respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 2.a and 2.b in the decretal \nsection of this decision, consideration of all established SOR conduct is required under the \u201cwhole \nperson\u201d concept.   \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nthe misconduct. I have persistent and serious doubts about his judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness.  \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s misconduct calls into question his current ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules and regulations. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude he has not mitigated the security concerns pertaining to drug involvement and \npersonal conduct.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d16 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d and 1.e: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nMark W. Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n \n16See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

Goldstein, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nAleksander Lamvol, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On February 8, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\n\nDirective \u00b6 E2.7(a): \u201ccontact with a foreign family member . . . who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign\n1\ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion[.]\u201d\n2\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On June 25, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Darlene Lokey-\nAnderson denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant filed a timely appeal\npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s factual\nfindings were supported by substantial record evidence; whether the Judge erred in failing to address\nheightened risk under Guideline B Disqualifying Condition 7(a);  whether the Judge erred in her\n1\napplication of the mitigating conditions; and whether the Judge erred in her whole person analysis.\nFinding no harmful error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following sustainable findings of fact: Applicant was born in Iran.  He\ncame to the U.S. in the mid-1970s to attend college.  He married a U.S. citizen in the mid-1980s, and\nthey had two children, who are also native-born U.S. citizens.  Applicant is a mechanical engineer\nfor a defense contractor.  He has held a security clearance since 1990 with no security violations.\nIn 2003, Applicant married an Iranian woman, who is currently a permanent resident.\nApplicant sponsored his wife\u2019s child from a prior marriage and her Iranian parents to come to the\nU.S.  Applicant subsequently filed for divorce from his second wife, which action was still pending\nat the close of the record.  Applicant\u2019s wife and  stepchild are Iranian citizens.  His parents-in-law\nand brother-in-law are residents and citizens of Iran.  Additionally, Applicant\u2019s father and brother\nare residents and citizens of Iran.  Applicant has another brother who, though an Iranian citizen,\nresides in a European country.  He also has a sister who is an Iranian citizen residing in another\nmiddle-eastern country.\nApplicant\u2019s mother is a naturalized U.S. citizen.  She divides her time between the U.S. and\nIran.  At the close of the record, Applicant\u2019s mother was living in Iran caring for Applicant\u2019s ailing\nfather.  Applicant maintains telephone or e-mail contact with his parents and siblings about once a\nmonth.  He has also sent birthday and wedding gifts to his Iranian relatives.  Applicant has traveled\nto Iran on five occasions from the late 1970s through the mid-2000s.  Each time, he used an Iranian\npassport, although he has subsequently surrendered it to his company\u2019s security office.\nIran has no diplomatic ties with the U.S.  It supports international terrorism, commits human\nrights violations, and is attempting to develop weapons of mass destruction. \nThe Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are supported by\nsubstantial record evidence.  See  Directive  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  (Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the\n\nFor example Applicant argued that the Judge erred in stating that Applicant still has contact with his current\n2\nwife and stepchild.  The only record evidence explicitly on point is to the effect that he does not have contact with these\npersons.  See, e. g., Answers to Statement of Reasons; Tr. at 50.  However, even if the Judge had made a finding on this\nmatter consistent with this evidence, such a finding would not likely have resulted in a favorable security clearance\ndecision when viewed in light of the record as a whole.\n3\ncontrary evidence in the same record.\u201d) To the extent that the Judge\u2019s findings contain error, the\nBoard concludes that such error is harmless.  See ISCR Case No. 06-23112 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 31,\n2007).   Applicant states that the Judge erred by not analyzing the heightened risk clause of\n2\nDisqualifying Condition 7(a).  Given that the relatives are in Iran, a hostile country with a \u201cdismal\nhuman rights record,\u201d the Judge\u2019s failure to discuss this issue is at most harmless error.  In light of\nthe record as a whole, the Judge has drawn a rational connection between the facts found and her\nultimate adverse security clearance decision, both as regards the mitigating conditions and the whole-\nperson factors.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  See also Motor Vehicle\nMfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.

He married a U.S. citizen in the mid-1980s, and they had two children, who are also native-born U.S. citizens. Applicant is a mechanical engineer for a defense contractor. He has held a security clearance since 1990 with no security violations. In 2003, Applicant married an Iranian woman, who is currently a permanent resident. Applicant sponsored his wife\u2019s child from a prior marriage and her Iranian parents to come to the U.S. Applicant subsequently filed for divorce from his second wife, which action was still pending at the close of the record. Applicant\u2019s wife and stepchild are Iranian citizens. His parents-in-law and brother-in-law are residents and citizens of Iran. Additionally, Applicant\u2019s father and brother are residents and citizens of Iran. Applicant has another brother who, though an Iranian citizen, resides in a European country. He also has a sister who is an Iranian citizen residing in another middle-eastern country. Applicant\u2019s mother is a naturalized U.S. citizen. She divides her time between the U.S. and Iran. At the close of the record, Applicant\u2019s mother was living in Iran caring for Applicant\u2019s ailing father. Applicant maintains telephone or e-mail contact with his parents and siblings about once a month. He has also sent birthday and wedding gifts to his Iranian relatives. Applicant has traveled to Iran on five occasions from the late 1970s through the mid-2000s. Each time, he used an Iranian passport, although he has subsequently surrendered it to his company\u2019s security office. Iran has no diplomatic ties with the U.S. It supports international terrorism, commits human rights violations, and is attempting to develop weapons of mass destruction.

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nJune 25, 2008 \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY-ANDERSON, Darlene, Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(eQip), on August 16, 2006.  On February 8, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guideline B for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on March 6, 2008,and he requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned on March 28, 2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on April 4, 2008,\nscheduling the hearing for April 24, 2008.  At the hearing the Government presented\nthree exhibits.  The Applicant called one witness, presented four exhibits and testified\non his own behalf.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on May 8, 2008.  Based\n\n2\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts concerning the current political condition in Iran.  Applicant had no\nobjection.  (Tr. p. 23).  The request and the attached documents were not admitted into\nevidence but were included in the record. The facts administratively noticed are set out\nin the Findings of Fact, below. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the\ntestimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 49 years of age and has a Masters Degree\nin Engineering.  He is employed as a Mechanical Engineering Design Manager for a\ndefense contractor.  He seeks a security clearance in connection with his employment\nin the defense industry.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign contacts\nthat could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise\nof classified information.\nThe Applicant was born in Iran in 1958.  He immigrated to the United States in\n1976, before the Revolution, to obtain an advanced education.  He obtained both his\nBachelors and Masters degrees and started working in the defense industry.  He\nmarried an American woman in 1984, and they had two children, who are native born\nAmerican citizens.  In 1987, he received his United States citizenship.  The Applicant\nreceived a security clearance in 1990, and has committed no security violations.  In\n2002, he and his first wife divorced.  \nIn 2003, the Applicant married an Iranian woman that he met through a friend in\nIran.  It took a year and a half before the Applicant was able to bring her to the United\nStates.  After going through the process of applying for her green card, in 2005, the\nApplicant\u2019s Iranian wife was permitted to come to the United States.  She is now a legal\npermanent resident.  She had a son from a previous marriage.  The Applicant\nsponsored her, her son, and her parents in Iran to come to the United States.  Their\nmarriage experienced problems, the Applicant filed for divorce in October 2007, and it is\npending.  The Applicant\u2019s wife, and his step-child are citizens of Iran.  His mother-in-law,\nfather-in-law, and brother-in-law are also residents and citizens of Iran.\nThe Applicant\u2019s father, and a brother are residents and citizens of Iran.  Another\nbrother of the Applicant\u2019s is a citizen of Iran, and resides in Sweden, and a sister is a\n\n3\ncitizen of Iran, and resides in the United Arab Emirates.  The Applicant has another\nbrother who resides in and is a citizen of the United States.     \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a United States citizen who received her citizenship in\n2002.  She travels between the United States and Iran.  When she comes to the United\nStates, she lives with the Applicant.  When she travels to Iran she lives with the\nApplicant\u2019s brother.  She is presently in Iran taking care of the Applicant\u2019s ailing father.\nThe Applicant maintains contact by telephone or e-mail with his mother, father, and\nbrother in Iran about once a month or so.  They also send him pictures of their children.\nThe Applicant has on occasion sent birthday and wedding gifts to his relatives in Iran. In\n2002, the Applicant\u2019s mother applied to bring the Applicant\u2019s two brothers and his sister\nto the United States.  They have applied for permanent residency and have INS file\nnumbers.\nThe Applicant has traveled to Iran on five separate occasions: 1978, for a\nsummer vacation; April 1996, when his father was sick; July 2000, for his brother\u2019s\nwedding; August 2007; December 2003 through January 2004 to visit his wife; and\nagain from December 2004 through January 2005, to bring his wife to the United States.\nOn each occasion, he traveled to Iran using his Iranian passport.  He has now\nsurrendered this Iranian passport to his company security office.  \nWhen asked what his intent is as far as traveling to Iran?  The Applicant stated,\n\u201cIf it jeopardizes my life here, it won\u2019t happen.  If there is some emergency happen - -\nlike I say my father is 77 years old and he is very sick - - if something happens, then I\nhave to do something.  Otherwise, I have no intention to go back there.\u201d  (Tr. p. 52).\nOther than the two year mandatory military service required by the Iranian\nGovernment, the Applicant has no relatives in Iran who are associated with, or\nemployed by the Iranian Government.   The Applicant indicates although he stands to\ninherit something from his father when he passes away, the Iranian Government goes\nthrough the assets first and will probably audit it and take it.\nThe Applicant further stated:\nOne other thing I just thought, everybody, including the President of\nthe United States is talking about the family values and what I do, the\ncontact I have with my family, that are in Iran or other countries, is\nbasically because of the family value that I have.  And I am not going to\nlose that.  That is not going to affect my job and the job - - the kind of job I\ndo here - - either.  But I guess I have been brought up, you know, that\nfamily is important and, you know, you have to respect that.  But it should\nnot - - you should not affect what you do and how you do it.  (Tr. pp. 64 -\n65).       \nThe Vice President of Engineering and Program Management, who has been the\nApplicant\u2019s direct supervisor for about three years, testified that the Applicant\u2019s work\n\n4\nproduct is highly rated.  His special capabilities involve his mechanical background that\nprovides a special skill for the company that is not easy to obtain.  The company is\ncurrently training others to replace him but it takes a long time to establish his level of\nexpertise.  (Tr. pp. 67-68). \nA letter of recommendation from another Vice President of Engineering, who was\nat one time the Applicant\u2019s direct supervisor, indicates that the Applicant is a very\ncapable, knowledgeable mechanical engineer and manager.  He has always delivered\nsafe and reliable products to the customer and his abilities, integrity and loyalties are of\nthe highest standard.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B). \nA letter of recommendation from a Senior Mechanical Engineer who worked with\nthe Applicant for ten years, between 1990-2000, indicates that the Applicant is honest\nand forthright, careful, respectful of the rules regarding the handling of classified\nmaterials.  He is proud to be a citizen of the United States and has consistently strived\nto meet its highest ideals.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C). \nA letter from the Facility Security Officer indicates that he is in possession of the\nApplicant\u2019s Iranian passport and that the company will notify DOHA in the event the\nIranian passport is returned to the Applicant for any reason.  (Government Exhibit 3).\nPerformance evaluations of the Applicant for 2005 and 2006 reflect that his work\nperformance always \u201cmeets standards\u201d.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D).   \nI have taken administrative notice of the current political conditions in Iran.  The\nfact that Iran has no diplomatic relations with the United States, Iran\u2019s efforts to acquire\nnuclear weapons and other weapon of mass destruction, its support for and involvement\nin international terrorism, it\u2019s support for violent opposition to the Middle East peace\nprocess, and it\u2019s dismal human rights records.  I have considered the fact that Iranian\nGovernment officials at all levels commit serious abuses of their power and authority.\nIt\u2019s Totalitarian Government and the fact that Iran supports terrorists activities, and is\nrampant with crime and instability.  The overall deteriorating security situation in Iran,\nthe human rights abuses, and the government corruption elevates the cause for\nconcern in the case.  The United States may face no greater challenge from a single\ncountry than from Iran.    \nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the\nDepartment of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors\nand conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given\nbinding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors\nshould be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the\nconditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can\nthey supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\n\n5\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and\ncircumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human\nexperience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth\nabove, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:\nForeign Influence\n6.  The Concern.  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism. \nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n7.  (a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risks of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion. \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\n\n6\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\neligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is\npredicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The\nadjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the\nwhole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination. \nThe Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw\ninferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in\nnature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865,\n\u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline B (foreign influence)\nthat establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While\na rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct\nand his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency\nof proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in\nrefutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past\nadverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for\na security clearance.\nAn individual who demonstrates a foreign connections may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nThe mere possession of a foreign passport raises legitimate questions as to whether the\nApplicant can be counted upon to place the interests of the United States paramount to\nthat of another nation. The Government must be able to place a high degree of\nconfidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations,\nat all times and in all places.\n\n7\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal\nstandards and factors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the\nrecord, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its\ncase as to all allegations in the SOR.   \nThe Applicant is a dual citizen of Iran and the United States.  He has significant\nfamily ties in Iran and there is strong evidence of a close bond and affection with his\nfamily in Iran.  His mother, father, brother, sister, wife, step-son, father-in-law, mother-\nin-law and brother-in-law are all citizens of Iran.  His mother, father, brother and in-laws\nall reside in Iran.  He maintains close and continuing contact with them, as he contacts\nthem at least once a month.  Although he is going through a divorce with his wife, and\nhis contact with her, his step-son and his in-laws is much less than it has been in the\npast, he still has some contact with them.  Furthermore, after becoming a United States\ncitizen, he traveled to Iran using his Iranian passport on at least five occasions for family\nmatters.  It does not go unrecognized that for over twenty five years he has worked hard\nto establish himself as a responsible, educated, American citizen.  However, he has not\ncut all ties from Iran.    \nUnder Foreign Influence, Disqualifying Condition 7(a) contact with a foreign\nfamily member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a\ncitizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risks of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion applies.  None of\nthe mitigation conditions apply. \nIt is noted that the current political situation in Iran elevates the cause for concern\nin this case.  Although there is no direct evidence that his family members in Iran are\nassociated in any way with the Iranian government, there is evidence of a close bond\nand strong evidence of affection with his family in Iran.  This bond and affection with his\nfamily could potentially cause the Applicant to become subject to foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  Therefore, the possibility of foreign\ninfluence exists that could create the potential for conduct resulting in the compromise\nof classified information.  I find that the Applicant is vulnerable to foreign influence.\nAccordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has not met the mitigating conditions\nof Guideline B of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.\nAccordingly, he has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline B.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\n\n8\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\nSubparas.\n1.a.: Against the Applicant\nSubparas.\n1.b.: Against the Applicant\n \nSubparas.\n1.c.: Against the Applicant\n \nSubparas.\n1.d.: Against the Applicant\nSubparas.\n1.e.: Against the Applicant\n \nSubparas.\n1.f.:  Against the Applicant\n \nSubparas.\n1.h.: Against the Applicant\n \nSubparas.\n1.i.:  Against the Applicant\n \nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n \n",

Under Guideline E, personal conduct, Applicant is alleged to have deliberately falsified her March 2007 e-QIP by denying that she was over 180 days delinquent on any debts within the last seven years and that she was currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts (SOR \u00b6 2.a). In her Answer (Item 3), Applicant admitted liability for several delinquent debts due to a divorce (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.l, 1.m, 1.t, 1.u), but asserted the $1,288 auto loan debt (SOR \u00b6 1.j) had been paid.

On January 15, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F and Guideline E that provided the basis for its\naction to deny her a security clearance and refer the matter to an administrative judge.\nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on February 6, 2008. She answered\nthe SOR in writing on February 26, 2008, and requested a decision without a hearing.\nOn March 26, 2008, the government submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM)\nconsisting of seven exhibits (Items 1-7). DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to\nJune 19, 2008\n\nIn a letter to DOHA of November 27, 2007 (Item 5), Applicant commented she was \u201canxious to receive [her]\n1\nfinal clearance.\u201d She may well have been granted an interim clearance, but it is not documented in the record.\nAvailable documentation (Item 5) shows Applicant signed a debt consolidation agreement with a law firm on\n2\nNovember 13, 2007.

On May 27, 2008, the case was assigned to me\nto consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue\na security clearance for Applicant. Based upon a review of the government\u2019s FORM,\nincluding Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR allegations (Item 3), eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleges under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owes\ndelinquent debt totaling $16,256 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.u), and that as of November\n2007 she had a negative cash flow of $231.80 each month (SOR \u00b6 1.v). Under\nGuideline E, personal conduct, Applicant is alleged to have deliberately falsified her\nMarch 2007 e-QIP by denying that she was over 180 days delinquent on any debts\nwithin the last seven years and that she was currently over 90 days delinquent on any\ndebts (SOR \u00b6 2.a). In her Answer (Item 3), Applicant admitted liability for several\ndelinquent debts due to a divorce (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.l, 1.m, 1.t,\n1.u), but asserted the $1,288 auto loan debt (SOR \u00b6 1.j) had been paid. She admitted\nshe also had a negative monthly balance after payment of expenses and some debts\n(SOR \u00b6 1.v). Applicant denied the other alleged delinquencies (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.g, 1.k, 1.n\nthrough 1.s). She also denied that she deliberately falsified her e-QIP (SOR \u00b6 2.a), and\naverred she had been unaware of any debts before a \u201cvisit\u201d from an investigator. After\nconsideration of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 41-year-old office manager who has worked for her employer since\nFebruary 2007 (Item 4). The available record does not show that she has ever held a\nsecurity clearance.1\nApplicant had two prior marriages that ended in divorce before she married her\ncurrent spouse in December 2003. While she was married to her second husband from\nApril 1999 to October 2003 (Item 4), she began to fall behind on several financial\nobligations (Item 5), as set forth in the following table (Items 5, 6, 7).\nDebt\nDelinquency history\nStatus as of Jan 08\n\u00b6 1.a $2,673 apartment\ndebt\n$2,673 for collection Jul\n04, due since Oct 02\nUnpaid, included in debt\nconsolidation plan2\n\nDebt\nDelinquency history\nStatus as of Jan 08\n3\n\u00b6 1.b $25 returned check \ndebt\n$36 for collection Mar 02,\nbalance $25 May 07  \nPlanned to pay debt by\nmid-Dec 07, unsatisfied by\nJan 08\n\u00b6 1.c $40 credit card\nbalance\nOpened Nov 06, $300\ncredit limit, $691 balance,\n$40 past due Dec 07 on\ngrantor closed account\nUnpaid, in debt\nconsolidation plan\n\u00b6 1.d $40 credit card debt\nOpened Feb 07, $554\nbalance Dec 07, $40 past\ndue on grantor closed\naccount\nDisputed by Applicant but\nlisted on Jan 08 credit\nreport (Item 6) as past\ndue, no evidence of\npayment\n\u00b6 1.e $239 revolving credit\ncard debt\nIndividual account opened\nNov 04, $239 charged off\nDec 05\nUnpaid, in debt\nconsolidation plan \n\u00b6 1.f $460 cellular phone\ndebt\n$535 charged off, $460\nbalance in collection as of\nApr 06\nUnpaid, in debt\nconsolidation plan\n\u00b6 1.g $5,162 auto loan\ndebt\nIndividual installment loan\n$10,967 opened Feb 01,\nvoluntary repossession,\n$4,012 charged off Feb\n04, $5,162 balance in\ncollection Nov 07\nUnpaid, listed as\nrepossession on Mar 07 e-\nQIP, in debt consolidation\nplan but denied in Feb 08\nwithout explanation\n\u00b6 1.h $529 revolving\ncharge debt\nOpened Jul 06, $300\ncredit limit, $529 past due\nJan 07\nUnpaid, in debt\nconsolidation plan \n\u00b6 1.i $363 gas credit card\ndebt\nOpened Apr 05, $413 past\ndue for collection Nov 05,\n$363 past due as of Oct\n07\nUnpaid, in debt\nconsolidation plan\n\u00b6 1.j $1,288 past due\nbalance on auto loan \nAuto loan of $26,816\nopened in Feb 07, $529\nper month for 73 months,\nlate 30 days as of Nov 07 \nPaid $800 in late Nov 07, \nnot reported to credit\nbureau which shows\n$1,288 past due as of Jan\n08\n\nDebt\nDelinquency history\nStatus as of Jan 08\n4\n\u00b6 1.k $341 student loan\ndebt\n$11,736 loan taken out\nSep 07, $113 monthly\npayments, $341 past due\nas of Dec 07\nNo evidence of payment,\nper Applicant in debt\nconsolidation plan as of\nNov 07, denied debt Feb\n08 without explanation\n\u00b6 1.l $898 collection debt\nUnknown type of debt\nreported as $898 for\ncollection Jan 07\nUnpaid, in debt\nconsolidation plan\n\u00b6 1.m $429 wireless phone\nservice debt\n$389 past due for\ncollection Feb 05, balance\n$429 Nov 07 in dispute\nwith credit bureau\nUnpaid, in debt\nconsolidation plan\n\u00b6 1.n $370 medical debt\nfor hospital services\n$370 for collection Feb 03,\nin dispute with credit\nbureau\nUnpaid, per Applicant in\ndebt consolidation as of\nNov 07, denied debt Feb\n08 without explanation\n\u00b6 1.o $370 medical debt\nfor hospital services\n$370 for collection Mar 03,\ndisputed with credit bureau\nUnpaid, per Applicant in\ndebt consolidation as of\nNov 07, denied debt Feb\n08 without explanation\n\u00b6 1.p $626 medical debt\nfor hospital services\n$626 for collection May 02,\ndisputed with credit bureau\nUnpaid, per Applicant in\ndebt consolidation as of\nNov 07, denied debt Feb\n08 without explanation\n\u00b61.q $341 medical debt for\nhospital services\n$341 for collection Mar 02,\ndisputed with credit bureau\nUnpaid, per Applicant in\ndebt consolidation as of\nNov 07; denied debt Feb\n08 without explanation \n\u00b6 1.r $50 medical debt for\nhospital services\n$50 for collection Feb 02,\ndisputed with credit bureau\nPer Applicant to be paid by\nmid-Dec 07, denied debt\nFeb 08 without\nexplanation, no evidence\nof payment\n\u00b6 1.s $50 medical debt for\nhospital services\n$50 for collection Jan 02,\ndisputed with credit bureau\nPer Applicant to be paid by\nmid-Dec 07; denied debt\nFeb 08 without\nexplanation, no evidence\nof payment\n\nDebt\nDelinquency history\nStatus as of Jan 08\nThis student loan may well be for her oldest child, who is now 20 (see Item 4).\n3\n5\n\u00b6 1.t $375 collection debt\nPlaced Mar 01, bal $375\nas of Feb 05\nUnpaid, in debt\nconsolidation\n\u00b6 1.u $1,587 installment\naccount\n$1009 for collection Dec\n01, $1529 balance past\ndue Dec 06, disputed with\ncredit bureau\n Unpaid, in debt\nconsolidation\nIn June 2003, Applicant went to work as an executive assistant for her current\nspouse. They married in late December 2003. From May 2005 to February 2007, she\nwas employed as an office assistant for another company (Item 4). In February 2007,\nApplicant financed the purchase of a 2007 model-year car through a loan of $26,816 to\nbe repaid at $529 per month for 73 months (SOR \u00b6 1.j) (Items 5, 7). As of February\n2007, a son from her first marriage was living outside the home but three other children\nbearing the surname of her second husband were living with her and her third spouse\n(Item 4). \nApplicant went to work as an administrative professional for her current\nemployer, a defense contractor (Item 4, Item 5), in February 2007. On March 2, 2007,\nApplicant completed an e-QIP. She responded \u201cYes\u201d to question 27b concerning any\nrepossessions in the last seven years, and disclosed the voluntary surrender of a\nvehicle in February 2001 on which she reported owing about $4,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.g) due to\nfinancial problems associated with a divorce. Applicant responded \u201cNo\u201d to question 28a.\n\u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d and\nquestion 28b. \u201cAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d\nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on March 16, 2007, revealed an outstanding\ncharged off balance of $4,012 for the repossessed auto she had listed on her e-QIP\n(SOR \u00b6 1.g). Applicant also reportedly owed other delinquent balances, including\n$2,673 to an apartment lessor (SOR \u00b6 1.a), revolving credit card debt of $1,131 (SOR\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.h, 1.i), wireless phone debt of $877 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.m), medical debt in\ncollection totaling $1,807 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n-1.s), and an  installment loan debt in collection\nsince December 2001 with an updated balance of $1,587 (SOR \u00b6 1.u) (Item 7).\nIn August 2007, Applicant and her third husband separated. She has since\nmaintained a separate residence from him, at a monthly rental cost of $1,150 (Item 5).\nIn September 2007, Applicant took out an educational loan of $11,736 to be\nrepaid at $113 per month for 180 months (SOR \u00b6 1.k).  In November 2007, DOHA\n3\nasked Applicant to document the status of her delinquent debts, to furnish a current\ncredit report, and to complete a personal financial statement. At the time, she was\nreportedly one month past due in her car loan (SOR \u00b6 1.j) (Item 5).\n\n6\nOn November 13, 2007, Applicant entered into an agreement with a law firm for\ndebt negotiation and debt settlement services. Under the debt settlement agreement,\nher total debt of $54,670 (including some current accounts) was to be settled for\npayments totaling $24,602. With fees of $11,350, she was to pay the estimated\nsettlement amount of $35,952 at $571 per month starting November 16, 2007 (Item 5).\nApplicant responded to DOHA\u2019s interrogatories on November 27, 2007. She\nindicated that the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.e-1.i, 1.m-1.q, and 1.t-1.u would be resolved\nunder the debt consolidation plan, and that she would pay some of the smaller debts\n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.n, 1.o) by December 16, 2007. She also provided documentation\nshowing that she paid $800 on her vehicle loan (SOR \u00b6 1.j) in late November 2007.\nDespite an annual salary of $50,000 and monthly child support income of $441,\nApplicant reported a monthly net deficit of $231.80 after payment of expenses and three\ndebts ($529 for her car, $372 for a line of credit opened in May 2007, and $352 for an\nunsecured loan opened in July 2007). Applicant did not indicate whether she had any\nbank savings (Item 5).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\n\n7\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquency since about 2001, when creditors\nbegan placing delinquent balances for collection (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.t, 1.u). Several more\nfinancial obligations became seriously past due in 2002, including a $2,673 debt to an\napartment lessor (SOR \u00b6 1.a), over $1,000 in medical debt (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p, 1.q, 1.r, 1.s),\nand a $36 debt for a returned check (SOR \u00b6 1.b). She lost her car through a voluntary\nrepossession for failure to make her payments during her second marriage (SOR \u00b6 1.g).\nYet many of her debts were incurred more recently. A revolving charge opened in\nNovember 2004 was charged off in December 2005 due to her failure to pay a relatively\nsmall $239 balance (SOR \u00b6 1.e). A cellular telephone debt of $460 was charged off and\nplaced for collection in 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). Her gasoline credit card opened in April 2005\nhad become $413 past due by November of that year (SOR \u00b6 1.i). She fell behind on\nconsumer credit card accounts opened in the past two years (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.h).  As\nof November 2007, she was late 30 days in her car payment (SOR \u00b6  1.j). As of\nDecember 2007, she owed a past due balance of $341 on a student loan taken out in\nSeptember 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.k). Significant security concerns are raised by \u201cinability or\n\n8\nunwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(a)) and by \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(c)).\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are too pervasive and too recent to satisfy\nmitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent,\nor occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d). As of February\n2008, she admitted she owed delinquent debt totaling about $7,618 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c,\n1.e-1.f, 1.h-1.i, 1.l-1.m, 1.t-1.u). Assuming the $800 she paid on her auto loan in\nNovember 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.j) went to the past due balance on her auto loan, there is\ncredible evidence of $6,550 in additional delinquent debt that she now denies. Her credit\ncard account with a balance of $554 was closed by the credit grantor when it became\n$40 past due (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Moreover, the student loan account opened in September\n2007 was reported on her January 2008 credit report as past due in the amount of $341\nwith last activity in October 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.k). She presented no evidence of any recent\npayments on the student loan. As for the remaining disputed debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.n-\n1.q), Applicant indicated in November 2007 that they were either included in her debt\nconsolidation, or she was going to pay them by mid-December 2007. She offered no\nexplanation for denying debts that she had previously acknowledged and that are listed\nas delinquent on one or more of her credit reports. AG \u00b6 20(e) (\u201cthe individual has a\nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the\nproblem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or\nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue\u201d) does not apply in the absence of\ndocumented proof substantiating her basis for disputing them. \nApplicant\u2019s effort to bring her automobile loan current warrant a favorable finding\nas to SOR \u00b6 1.j, but it is not enough to apply either AG \u00b6 20(c) (\u201cthe person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d) or AG \u00b6 20(d) (\u201cthe individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d).  She\nhas arranged to settle most of her debt under a debt repayment plan, but this is but a\npreliminary first step to resolve her debt and not a substitute for a track record of regular\npayments. Given her negative cash flow situation (she reported a monthly deficit of\n$231.80 as of November 2007), it is not at all clear that she will be able to make the\n$571 monthly payments required under the debt consolidation contract.\nApplicant attributes her financial problems to her divorce (\u201cI will say that the debt\nlisted is a direct result of a drastic financial change in circumstances brought about by\ndivorce.\u201d Item 3). Yet Applicant has failed to adequately document or explain the extent\nto which factors beyond her control caused the majority of her indebtedness. AG \u00b6 20(b)\n(\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances\u201d) applies only in very limited part in that the financial burden of\nmaintaining a separate residence since August 2007 was a likely factor in her falling\nbehind in her car loan, student loan, and recently opened credit card accounts during\n\n9\nthe last quarter of 2007. It does not extenuate or mitigate the years of financial poor\njudgment evident in her repeatedly taking on new debt while old debt went unpaid.\nApplicant has not demonstrated that she can handle her finances responsibly.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern for Personal Conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nWhen Applicant applied for a security clearance in early March 2007, she owed\non several accounts that were seriously past due and had been charged off or placed\nfor collection (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.e-1.i, 1.l-1.u). These debts should have been reported\nin response to the financial delinquency inquiries pertinent to debts over 180 days within\nthe past seven years (question 28a) and to debts currently over 90 days delinquent\n(question 28b). Applicant instead responded \u201cNo\u201d to both questions. \nUnder AG \u00b6 16(a) personal conduct concerns are raised by the \u201cdeliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\u201d Applicant does not contest that she answered \u201cNo\u201d to the debt\ninquiries, but submits she did not intentionally falsify her e-QIP. In answer to DOHA\u2019s\nconcerns that she falsified material facts, Applicant stated, \u201cWhen I completed the E-\nQuip, I was unaware of the items listed in this Statement of Reasons. It was only after a\nvisit from an investigator that I became aware of these items.\u201d (Item 3).\nThe burden is on the government of proving knowing falsification in light of\nApplicant\u2019s denial. The government presented as Item 7 Applicant\u2019s credit report from\nMarch 16, 2007, showing charged off or collection balances on several individual\naccounts which support a reasonable inference of intentional falsification. On or more\nlikely before March 16, 2007, Applicant had disputed with the credit bureaus her\nresponsibility for some medical debt (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n-1.s) and a wireless services debt\n(SOR \u00b6 1.m). This shows Applicant knew before any visit from a government\ninvestigator that some accounts were being reported on her credit record as collection\naccounts. Even if she had a good-faith basis to believe she did not owe those debs, she\nhas not disputed then or now her responsibility for her delinquent gas credit card in\nSOR \u00b6 1.i, the cellular phone debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f, the credit card debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e, or the\napartment debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a. All are individual accounts that had been in collection for\nseveral months (in the case of the apartment debt since July 2004) by the time she\n\n10\ncompleted her e-QIP. There is no evidence that someone else used or handled\npayment of her accounts in a manner that would have kept her from knowing about\nthem. Security concerns are raised under AG \u00b6 16(a) in the absence of persuasive\nevidence showing she was ignorant of her debt when she completed her e-QIP. Her\nlisting of the car repossession in response to question 27b did not relieve her of her\nresponsibility to report other delinquencies under question 28a and/or 28b. Concerns as\nto whether Applicant has been fully candid about the reasons for the omission of\ndelinquent debt from her e-QIP preclude me from considering AG \u00b6 17(a) (\u201cthe\nindividual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or\nfalsification before being confronted with the facts\u201d), even though Applicant is credited\nwith acknowledging several of the debts when she responded to DOHA interrogatories\nin November 2007.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider\nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public\ntrust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding this case. The government must be assured that those\npersons with classified access can be counted on to exercise good judgment at all\ntimes. Applicant remains under a significant debt burden that is not likely to be resolved\nin the near future.

Edmunds, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\n\nIdentified in the record as Hearing Exhibit II.\n1\n2\nclearance.  On November 26, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) and\nB (Foreign Influence) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On March 31, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative\nJudge Edward W. Loughran granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department\nCounsel filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in\nconcluding that Applicant\u2019s status did not raise Guideline C security concerns; and whether the\nJudge\u2019s favorable decision under Guideline B is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding\nno error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is an engineer working\nfor a defense contractor.  Born in India, he came to the U.S. to attend graduate school.  He has held\nan Indian passport, though he never used it.  \nHis parents are residents and citizens of India, as are his mother-in-law and father-in-law.\nHe has three siblings, one of whom is a citizen and resident of India, the remaining two being\ncitizens and residents of the U.S.  Applicant and his wife traveled to India four times in the recent\npast to visit their parents.  He holds no foreign assets and has no intention of returning to India to\nlive.\nApplicant has held a status called \u201cOverseas Citizen of India\u201d (OCI).  He did so in order to\nfacilitate foreign travel.  According to a Department of State Consular Information Sheet,  OCI is\n1\na status which permits a holder to travel to and from India, to work and study there, and to obtain\nproperty there.  It is not a \u201cdual nationality\u201d program, being more in the nature of a green card.  This\ndocument states that OCI status does not confer Indian citizenship upon a holder.  Applicant has\nrenounced his OCI status out of concern that it would affect his clearance eligibility.  He had\npreviously surrendered his Indian passport when applying for OCI status.\nDepartment Counsel argued on appeal that the Judge\u2019s favorable decision under Guideline\nC did not take into account significant contrary record evidence.  OCI status, he contended, raises\na serious question as to whether Applicant has shown a preference for India over the U.S. and that\nit was error for the Judge to conclude that Applicant\u2019s OCI status did not raise security concerns\nunder Guideline C.  He stated that \u201cit was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law for the . . . Judge\nto conclude that only full foreign citizenship is covered under Adjudicative Guidelines \u00b6 10.\u201d\nDepartment Counsel Brief at 7.  The Board has considered these arguments in light of the Judge\u2019s\ndecision and the record as a whole, paying particular attention to the previously- referenced Consular\nInformation Sheet, an official U.S. document whose contents are binding upon the Judge.   See ISCR\nCase No. 05-11292 at 4, n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007) (\u201c. . . Official pronouncements by the\nPresident, State Department, Department of Defense, or other appropriate federal agency on matters\n\nIt is not necessarily contradictory to find conduct or circumstances mitigated for the purposes of one guideline\n2\nbut still disqualifying in the context of relevant matters in another guideline.\nDirective \u00b6 E2.11(b): \u201c[T]he individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship\u201d and  Directive\n3\n\u00b6 E2.11(e): \u201c[T]he passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise\ninvalidated[.]\u201d   \n3\nof national security are equivalent to legislative facts for purposes of DOHA adjudications in that\nthey bind the Judge and are not subject to refutation . . .\u201d) \nWithout elaboration, the Consular information Sheet states that the OCI program does not\ngrant Indian citizenship.  The gravamen of Department Counsel\u2019s argument is that the OCI program\nestablishes some form of citizenship, at least in the eyes of the Indian government.  The Judge had\nto consider all the evidence but was bound by the Consular Information Sheet.  The record provides\nno basis to hold that the Judge\u2019s analysis of Applicant\u2019s OCI status was error.  Moreover, there is\nambiguity in the Judge\u2019s decision in that, after declaring that no Foreign Preference disqualifying\ncondition was raised by the OCI status, the Judge goes on to rely on Applicant\u2019s renunciation of his\nOCI status and surrender of his OCI card in his overall analysis of Guideline B.   This suggests that\n2\nthe Judge may, in fact, have attributed some security significance to the OCI status, notwithstanding\nhis one unequivocal statement to the contrary.  In any event, the Judge, in effect, concluded in the\nalternative that Applicant had satisfied two Guideline C mitigating conditions  and this conclusion\n3\nis sustainable on this record.  Therefore, to the extent the Judge erred in his treatment of the\ndisqualifying conditions, such error is harmless. \nDepartment Counsel also argues that it was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law for the\nJudge to conclude that only full citizenship is covered under the Guidelines, \u00b6 10.  The Board does\nnot interpret the Judge\u2019s decision as asserting or implying such a position.  \nConcerning Guideline B, Department Counsel is correct that the Government\u2019s security\nconcerns are broader than the limited possibility of the use of coercive means of influence.\nHowever, a review of the Judge\u2019s decision leads the Board to conclude that the Judge did not confine\nhis analysis under Guideline B to only coercive means of influence.  Department Counsel\u2019s brief\ncites several passages where the Judge spoke solely in terms of \u201ccoercion.\u201d  Yet, in other portions\nof his Decision, the Judge uses terms like \u201cinducement,\u201d \u201cpersuasion,\u201d and \u201cconflicts of interest\u201d\nwhen discussing the potential security concerns raised by the presence of Applicant\u2019s family\nmembers in India.  Judges\u2019 decisions are not measured by a standard of perfection.  The fact that the\nJudge did not engage in a detailed discussion of bribery and illegal gratuities as forms of foreign\ninfluence, and did not engage in the type of conflict of interest analysis proffered by Department\nCounsel, does not establish error.  The terms used by the Judge, though general, are broad in scope\nand fairly embrace the concept of non-coercive means of influence.  The Judge\u2019s use of them\nindicates that he considered an appropriate spectrum of types of foreign influence, and \u201ca satisfactory\nexplanation for [his] conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found\u201d and his\nultimate decision, both as to the application of the mitigating conditions and the whole-person\nanalysis.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 9App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  \n\n4\nThe record supports the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant has met his burden of persuasion\nthat it is \u201cclearly consistent with the interests of the national security\u201d for him to have a clearance.\nSee Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  \u201cThe Board need not agree with a\nJudge\u2019s decision in order to find it sustainable.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 06-23881 at 2 (App. Bd. November\n2, 2007).  Accordingly, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s decision, as to both Guidelines B and\nC, is sustainable.\n \n  \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is AFFIRMED.  \nSigned: Michael Y.

The two countries are the world\u2019s largest \ndemocracies, both committed to political freedom protected by representative \ngovernment, and share common interests in the free flow of commerce, in fighting \nterrorism, and in creating a strategically stable Asia. However, differences over India\u2019s \nnuclear weapons program and pace of economic reform exist. There are also concerns \nabout India\u2019s relations with Iran, including their increasing cooperation with the Iranian \nmilitary. \n \nThere have been cases involving the illegal export, or attempted illegal export, of \nU.S. restricted, dual use technology to India, including technology and equipment which \nwere determined to present an unacceptable risk of diversion to programs for the \ndevelopment of weapons of mass destruction or their means of delivery. Foreign \ngovernment entities, including intelligence organizations and security services, have \ncapitalized on private-sector acquisitions of U.S. technology, and acquisition of sensitive \nU.S. technology by foreign private entities does not slow its flow to foreign governments \nor its use in military applications. \n \nThe U.S. views India as a growing world power with which it shares common \nstrategic interests. There is a strong partnership between the two countries and they are \nexpected to continue to address differences and shape a dynamic and collaborative \nfuture. The U.S. and India are seeking to elevate the strategic partnership further to \ninclude cooperation in counter-terrorism, defense cooperation, education, and joint \ndemocracy promotion. \n \n\u201cOverseas Citizens of India\u201d \n \nThe Constitution of India does not allow one to hold Indian citizenship and \ncitizenship of a foreign country simultaneously. India decided to grant Overseas \nCitizenship of India. Commonly, but incorrectly, known as \u201cdual citizenship.\u201d Persons of \nIndian origin who migrated from India and acquired citizenship of a foreign country other \nthan Pakistan and Bangladesh are eligible for grant of OCI as long as their home \ncountries allow dual citizenship in some form under their local laws.9 The U.S. \nDepartment of State Consular Information Sheet on India addressed dual nationality: \n \nIn 2006, India launched the \u201cOverseas Citizens of India\u201d (OCI) program, \nwhich has often been mischaracterized as a dual nationality program, as it \ndoes not grant Indian citizenship. Thus, an American who obtains an OCI \ncard is not a citizen of India and remains a citizen of the United States. An \nOCI card in reality is similar to a U.S. \u201cgreen card\u201d in that a holder can \ntravel to and from India indefinitely, work in India, study in India, and own \nproperty in India (except for certain agricultural and plantation properties). \n                                                          \n9 GE 3; AE L. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nAn OCI holder, however, does not receive an Indian passport, cannot vote \nin Indian elections and is not eligible for Indian government employment.10 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n                                                          \n10 HE II. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in \nAG \u00b6 9: \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 10. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember.  This includes but is not limited to: \n \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport;  \n \n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or \nother such benefits from a foreign country; \n \n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an \nAmerican citizen. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s last Indian passport was issued in 1999, while he was still an Indian \ncitizen. It was scheduled to expire in 2009. He continued to possess it after he became \na U.S. citizen, but he never used it. India does not recognize dual citizenship, and the \npassport was cancelled in 2007, when Applicant obtained OCI status. AG \u00b6 10(a) was \napplicable while the passport was valid. Applicant was subsequently granted status as \nan Overseas Citizen of India. Despite the misnomer, this is not citizenship. The U.S. \nState Department equated it to a U.S. green card. No Foreign Preference disqualifying \ncondition has been raised by Applicant\u2019s OCI status.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate Foreign Preference security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 11, including: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n\n \n7 \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; \n \n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship \noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the \nindividual was a minor; \n \n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security \nauthority; and \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated. \n \nIndia does not recognize dual citizenship. When Applicant became a U.S. citizen, \nhe in essence gave up his Indian citizenship. Like almost everybody else in his \nsituation, he still had his Indian passport after becoming a U.S. citizen, but he did not \nuse it. The passport was canceled by the Indian Embassy as part of the process for \nApplicant to obtain OCI status. He has formally renounced his OCI status and \nsurrendered the OCI card to the Indian Embassy. AG \u00b6\u00b6 11(b) and (e) are applicable. \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 7: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \n\n \n8 \n \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents, brother, and parents-in-laws are citizens and residents of \nIndia. His father worked as an engineer for the state government before he retired about \n21 years ago. He collects a pension based on that employment. His brother presently \nworks as an engineer for the state government. India is the world\u2019s largest democracy, \nworks closely with the U.S. on many matters, shares common strategic interests, and \ngenerally respects the rights of its citizens. But it also continues to have some human \nrights issues, has been victimized by terrorist attacks, and restricted, dual use \ntechnology has been illegally exported to India. This creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. It also creates a potential \nconflict of interest. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), (b), and (d) have been raised by the evidence. \n \nConditions that could mitigate Foreign Influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n\n \n9 \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nApplicant came to the U.S. as a young man to further his education. He \nremained, obtained a successful career as an engineer, married, had a child with \nanother on the way, and became a U.S. citizen. While he and his wife still have family in \nIndia that they love, their life and future are here. India is a democracy and strategic \npartner of the U.S. Technology has been illegally exported to India, but the documents \nprovided by Counsel do not show that coercion was utilized. I find that it is unlikely \nApplicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of the \nIndian government or his family members in India and the interests of the United States. \nI further find there is minimal conflict of interest, because Applicant can be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8 (b) are \npartially applicable. Because Applicant has been a U.S. citizen for less than two years, I \nam unable to find the mitigating conditions fully applicable. No other mitigating condition \nis applicable. \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was born in India. He \ncame to the U.S. in 1992 to further his education. He obtained permanent residency \nstatus, remained in the U.S., thrived and became an established, highly regarded \nengineer, with considerable U.S. ties and assets. He and his wife became U.S. citizens \nin June 2006. He has a seven-year-old child and his wife is pregnant with their second \nchild. His life, immediate family, professional career, and future are now here.  \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to India. There is a strong \npartnership between the U.S. and India and they share common strategic interests. \nHowever, Guideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d11 The distinctions between friendly and unfriendly \ngovernments must be made with caution. Relations between nations can shift, \nsometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. Furthermore, friendly nations can have \nprofound disagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to \ntheir vital interests or national security. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged \nin espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and \ntechnical fields. Nevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with \nthe U.S., and its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an \napplicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or \nthe country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the U.S. \n \n \n \nIndia is a democracy that generally respects the rights of its citizens, but \nnumerous serious problems remain. Like almost every country, including the United \nStates, it has been victimized by terrorist acts. Restricted, dual use technology has been \nillegally exported to India, but there is no indication that India utilizes coercion against its \ncitizens for espionage purposes. Many of our allies conduct intelligence gathering \nagainst the U.S. India would be risking a great deal by raising the stakes, and \nattempting to use duress against one of its citizens in an attempt to coerce a U.S. \ncitizen to commit espionage. Applicant is obviously closer to his parents than his \nbrother. He speaks to him much less frequently and did not see him on any of his recent \nvisits to India. Applicant\u2019s father is 80 years old and has been retired for 21 years. While \nhis brother does work for the state government and his father receives a pension, \nApplicant\u2019s position, assets, and ties in the U.S. make economic coercion through his \nbrother or father extremely unlikely to happen and even less likely to succeed.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Foreign Preference and Foreign Influence security \nconcerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n                                                          \n11 ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On January 7, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a decision on the written record.  On June 30, 2008, after considering the record,\nAdministrative Judge Paul J. Mason denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nfiled a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of\nfact are supported by substantial record evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s unfavorable security\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nApplicant is 33 years old and a senior contract administrator for a defense contractor.  She\nalso has been employed as a bartender since April 2005.  \nThe Judge found that Applicant has delinquent debts, one for a car and another for a \u201ctire\naccount.\u201d  Decision at 2.  Although the SOR contains three allegations, the Judge found that the first\ntwo refer to the same car purchase.  Applicant made inconsistent statements concerning her debts\nand provided no evidence to demonstrate an intent to pay them off.  The Judge concluded that\nApplicant had not met her burden of persuasion, either under the pertinent mitigating conditions or\nunder the whole-person factors.  He stated that Applicant \u201cmentioned financial hardships but did not\nexplain what those hardships were.

Failure to pay those two accounts, or resolve past mistakes, demonstrates\nunwillingness to satisfy debts that has not been mitigated by any of the [Guideline F mitigating\nconditions].\u201d  Decision at 5-6.  \nWe have examined the Judge\u2019s decision in light of the record as a whole.  The Judge\u2019s\nmaterial findings of security concern are supported by substantial record evidence.  See  Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  (Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as\nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d)  In support\nof her appeal, Applicant submitted new evidence not contained in the record, which the Board cannot\nconsider.  \u201cNo new evidence shall be received or considered by the Appeal Board.\u201d  Directive  \u00b6\nE3.1.29.  Applicant cites to information she reports that she provided to \u201cthe Investigator\u201d and does\nnot understand why it was not in the record.  A review of the record shows that Applicant was sent\na copy of the record to be considered by the Judge, along with a cover letter dated March 6, 2008,\nwhich advised her that \u201cIf you do not file any objections to the attached material or submit any\nadditional information within 30 days of receipt of this letter, your case will be assigned to an\nAdministrative Judge for a determination based solely on the attached file of relevant material.\u201d  The\nrecord demonstrates that Applicant submitted no objections or additional information.  Her case was\nprocessed accordingly.  \n\n3\nThe Judge has drawn a rational connection between the facts found and his ultimate adverse\nsecurity clearance decision.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  See also\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.

Applicant made inconsistent statements concerning her debts and provided no evidence to demonstrate an intent to pay them off. The Judge concluded that Applicant had not met her burden of persuasion, either under the pertinent mitigating conditions or under the whole-person factors. He stated that Applicant \u201cmentioned financial hardships but did not explain what those hardships were. Even though she may have incurred no new debt in the last five years, she still has the two past due accounts; one is more than four years old, and the other is more than seven years old. Failure to pay those two accounts, or resolve past mistakes, demonstrates unwillingness to satisfy debts that has not been mitigated by any of the [Guideline F mitigating conditions].\u201d Decision at 5-6. We have examined the Judge\u2019s decision in light of the record as a whole. The Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are supported by substantial record evidence.

Delaney, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SCA), on June 29, 2006.\nOn January 7, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under financial considerations\n(Guideline F) and personal conduct (Guideline E). The action was taken pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and made effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued on or after September 1, 2006. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted her answer to the SOR on January 31, 2008, and requested\na decision be made on the record in lieu of a hearing. A copy of the Government\u2019s File\nof Relevant Material (FORM, the government\u2019s evidence in support of the allegations of\nthe SOR) was sent to Applicant on March 6, 2008. Applicant received the FORM on\nJune 30, 2008\n\n I am unable to provide a reliable or credible explanation for why there are different case numbers. \n1\n2\nMarch 11, 2008. Her response was due April 10, 2008. No response was received. The\ncase file was assigned to me on May 27, 2008. \nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR contains three allegations under the financial considerations guideline.\nApplicant admitted SOR 1.a. and 1.c. but denied SOR 1.b. In the explanatory portion of\nher answer, she pointed out the financial problems occurred more than five years ago,\nand, since then, she has been working at a full-time and part-time job to avoid the same\nproblems from recurring. Also, in that period of time, she has purchased two\nautomobiles, and opened two credit card accounts. In the last paragraph of her answer,\nshe stated, \u201dWhile I am not requesting to have a hearing, it is my hope that a favorable\ndecision will be made based on my efforts to remedy past mistakes and my current\nstatus.\u201d\nItem 1 reflects Applicant is 33 years old and single. She has been employed as a\nsenior contract administrator by a defense contractor since December 2005. She also\nhas been employed as a bartender since April 2005. She seeks a secret security\nclearance. \nFinancial Considerations\nThe SOR lists the same car credit judgment twice under SOR 1.a. and SOR 1.b.\nMy finding that these entries refer to the same car judgment is based on the credit\nbureau reports that display very similar information about when the account was\nopened, and when the judgment was filed.  The car account was opened in March\n1\n1999, and fell delinquent in February 2001. A judgment was filed against Applicant in\nFebruary 2002. (Item 8) The collection account $445.00 referred to in SOR 1.c. is a tire\naccount Applicant opened in March 2003, and became delinquent in October 2003.\n(Item 8) \nDuring the security investigation, Applicant has provided different positions about\nthe past due debts. In her SCA (Item 5), she admitted the debts listed in the SOR. Yet,\nin November 2007 (Item 6, answers to interrogatories), Applicant was presented with\nthe same list of creditors (the SOR creditors are included in that list). She denied the car\ncredit account belonged to her. She also disputed the SOR 1.c. debt, noting the account\nwas charged off and closed. In her answer to the SOR, she concedes that the debts are\nhers, but refers to a five-year period in which she has supposedly rehabilitated her\ncredit. She provided no evidence of having contacted either creditor or of explaining\nhow she intends to make either creditor whole. I find Applicant does not intend to repay\nthe overdue debt. \nApplicant has not presented any evidence regarding her job performance or her\nlife away from the job. There is also no evidence concerning her financial practices\n\n3\nexcept what she indicated in her answer to the SOR. Having opened two credit card\naccounts and purchased two cars does not necessarily translate into sound financial\npractices, particularly when personal loan accounts are also opened. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2b.\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n\n4\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\n18. The Concern. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is\nalso a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\u201d \nThe record evidence indicates the Government has established its case under\nthe financial considerations guideline. Applicant opened an installment account (SOR\n1.b.) with a credit company to purchase a car. She could not sustain the payments, and\nthe account became delinquent in February 2001. A judgment was taken against her in\nFebruary 2002. The SOR 1.c. account was opened in March 2003, and converted to a\ndelinquent status in October 2003. FC disqualifying condition (DC) 19.a. (inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC 19.c. (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations) apply. Having carefully evaluated the language Applicant used denying the\ncar account altogether in Item 6, I conclude that Applicant was unwilling in November\n2007 to acknowledge the car judgment. Based on the words used by Applicant in Item 6\nin describing the SOR 1.c. debt as charged off and closed, I conclude Applicant did not\nbelieve she owed the debt because of the debt was somehow done away with. \nIn her January 2008 answer to the SOR, Applicant acknowledges the two\naccounts, but claims the purchase of two cars and the opening of two personal loans\nmeans that she has her financial responsibilities under control.\nEven though there are only two debts listed in the SOR totaling a little more than\n$13,000.00, both debts are in a delinquent status and one has been converted to a\njudgment. Under the FC guideline, an applicant is required to present evidence that\nshows their delinquent debts have been resolved, or provide compelling evidence that\ndemonstrates why the debts have not been resolved. \nThere are five mitigating conditions (MC) that are potentially applicable to the\ncircumstances. They are: FC MC 20.a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment);\nFC MC 20.b. (the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control, and the individual acted reasonably under the circumstances); FC\nMC 20.c. (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is resolved or under control); FC MC 20.d.\n(the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay creditors or otherwise resolve debts);\n\n5\nand, FC MC 20.e. (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause or of the problem and provides documented proof to\nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the\nissue). FC MC 20.a. does not apply. Though the delinquent debt was incurred more\nthan four years ago, Applicant has provided no evidence to indicate that the debt\nproblem is unlikely to recur. Her failure to produce evidence to show why the financial\nproblems are unlikely to recur continues to cast doubt on her trustworthiness and good\njudgment. \nFC MC 20.b. is inapplicable as Applicant has not presented any evidence\nidentifying the reason she incurred financial problems. Without specific evidence\ndescribing her situation for example, a loss of employment, a business downturn, or an\nunexpected medical condition, I cannot speculate as to what her financial hardships\nwere. FC MC 20.b. does not apply. FC MC 20.c. does not apply as there is no evidence\nApplicant participated in financial counseling or reorganized her financial obligations so\nthat her indebtedness is under control. \nFC MC 20.d. (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts) does not apply. The language Applicant employed in her\nanswers to interrogatories in November 2007, and in her January 2008 answer to the\nSOR persuades me she has no intention of repaying either creditor. FC MC 20.e. does\nnot apply because Applicant finally acknowledges (she does not dispute) she owes the\ndebts, but does not intend to repay the judgment or the collection account. \nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nThe AG indicates the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and whole person concept. The WPC is made of nine\ngeneral policy factors:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nthe participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and, (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant used poor judgment in not paying the car debt before it became a judgment.\nShe mentioned financial hardships, but did not explain what those hardships were. Even\nthough she may have incurred no new debt in the last five years, she still has the two\npast due accounts; one is more than four years old, and the other is more than seven\nyears old. Failure to pay those two accounts, or resolve past mistakes, demonstrates an\n\n6\nunwillingness to satisfy debts that has not been mitigated by any of the MC factors of\nthe FC guideline. Accordingly, Applicant has failed to mitigate the FC guideline. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn April 26, 2007, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an \nElectronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security \nClearance Application. On November 21, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended and modified; and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended and modified (Directive). The SOR alleged security concerns under \nGuidelines J (Criminal Conduct) and E (Personal Conduct), and detailed reasons why \nDOHA could not make a preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApril 9, 2009\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nApplicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \nIt should be noted that on December 29, 2005, the President promulgated \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified \nInformation, and on August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) \npublished a memorandum directing implementation of those revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines (hereinafter AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under \nthe Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel \nSecurity Program (January 1987), as amended and modified (Regulation), in which the \nSOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.  The AG are applicable to Applicant\u2019s \ncase because his SOR was issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 28, 2008. In a sworn, \nwritten statement, dated that same day, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations \nand requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel indicated \nthe Government was prepared to proceed on December 8, 2008, and the case was \nassigned to Administrative Judge Martin H. Mogul on December 12, 2008. It was \nreassigned to me on January 23, 2009, due to caseload considerations. A Notice of \nHearing was issued on February 2, 2009, and I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on \nFebruary 11, 2009. \n \nDuring the hearing, five Government exhibits and two Applicant exhibits were \nadmitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified. The transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) was received on February 19, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied all of the factual allegations in the \nSOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d., and 1.a. and 1.b.).  \n \nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and he is seeking to \nretain a SECRET security clearance.  He currently holds an interim clearance. Applicant \nhas never been married.1 He has been gainfully employed by the same defense \ncontractor since March 2007, and currently serves as a mechanic.2 His employment \nhistory since 1999 includes various periods of unemployment (January-April 2001, \nAugust 2001-February 2002, June 2002-January 2003, April 2003-April 2004, \nDecember 2004-November 2005, and January-March 2007).3  \n \n \n1 Government Exhibit 1 (e-QIP, dated April 26, 2007), at 25. \n \n2 Id. at 11. \n \n3 Id. at 12-13, 15, 17-18, 20-21. \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \ne a month.   \n                                                          \nCriminal Conduct  \n \nApplicant was a substance abuser whose choice of substances was alcohol, \nmarijuana, and methamphetamines (\u201cspeed\u201d).  He was a frequent consumer of alcohol \nfrom the time he was in high school, during 1980-81, sometimes while with friends and \nsometimes alone, until about 2003.4  He would consume limited amounts of alcohol on \nweekends, and get intoxicated two or three times per year.5 He estimated it would take \nsix beers or mixed drinks for him to become intoxicated.6 Applicant\u2019s excessive \nconsumption of alcohol diminished substantially in 2003 after he was diagnosed with \ndiabetes.7 Since that time, he no longer goes to bars, and limits his alcohol \nconsumption to one or two beers at a time, once or twic\n8\n \nHis drug use started earlier while in high school, during 1977-81, when he started \nexperimenting9 with marijuana and methamphetamines,10 and continued until about \n2003, when it ceased forever.11 He considered his drug abuse to be recreational, and \noccasionally would use those substances, at most once a month, either alone or with \nfriends.12 There were also periods of four or five months at a time when he did not use \nany drugs.13 He attributed some of his substance abuse to peer pressure,14 depression, \nand being upset over certain past incidents.15 \n \nDuring the period from July 1992 through March 2001, Applicant was arrested \nthree times for substance-related activities.  In October 1993, after smoking marijuana \nwith a friend, Applicant was upset over not being paid for some work he had done, and \ndecided to ride his bicycle to get a beer and cool off. He was stopped by police for \nunknown reasons.16  For some unexplained reason, Applicant attempted to flee, and \n \n4 Government Exhibit 2 (Interrogatories and answers to interrogatories, dated October 27, 2008) at 4. \n \n5 Id. \n \n6 Id. \n \n7 Id. \n \n8 Tr. at 76. \n \n9 Government Exhibit 2, supra note 4, at 3. \n \n10 Id. at 10; Government Exhibit 1, supra note 1, at 34. \n \n11 Tr. at 46, 56. \n \n12 Government Exhibit 2, supra note 4, at 4. \n \n13 Id. \n \n14 Tr. at 57. \n \n15 Government Exhibit 2, supra note 4, at 4. \n \n16 Id. at 9. \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nthe officer threw a flashlight to stop him.17 A search of Applicant incident to the arrest, \nrevealed an amount of marijuana, a pipe for smoking marijuana,18 and a 3.5 to 4 inch \nlong folding double-edged buck knife,19 characterized by the police as a \u201cdangerous \nweapon,\u201d20 and by Applicant as a \u201cpocket knife.\u201d21  He was charged with (1) possession \nof a dangerous weapon (the knife), a felony; (2) possession of less than 28.5 grams of \nmarijuana; and (3) resisting arrest.22 The 2nd charge was amended to possession of \ncontrolled substance paraphernalia.  The 1st charge was dismissed; the 2nd charge was \nsuspended and he was sent to a drug diversion program. He was convicted of the 3rd \ncharge and sentenced to 12 months probation and 2 days in jail. The diversion term \nwas successful and the charge was eventually dismissed.23 \n \nIn February 1997, after consuming alcohol at a bar with a friend, Applicant got \nbehind the wheel of his truck and was driving home when one wheel drifted slightly off \nthe road and the friend grabbed the wheel, causing an over-correction.  The truck rolled \nand ended up in a field.  Applicant was unhurt, but his friend sustained minor injuries \nand was transported to the hospital.24 Applicant admitted he was intoxicated, and was \nadministered a blood test. His blood-alcohol level registered 0.15 or 0.16 percent.25 He \nwas charged with (1) driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI); and DUI causing \nbodily injury. He was subsequently convicted of the 1st charge and the 2nd charge was \ndismissed in the furtherance of justice.  He was sentenced to 2 days time served in jail, \n3 years probation, a substantial fine, and ordered to attend a first offender\u2019s DUI \nprogram.26  He successfully completed his probation and all required counseling.27 \n \nIn March 2001, after consuming alcohol at a bar alone, followed by an \nunspecified period of additional drinking alone in his car, Applicant became, by his own \nadmission, intoxicated.28 He subsequently drove around searching for female \ncompanionship.  He solicited a date with a woman who, unfortunately for Applicant, \n \n17 Id. \n \n18 Id. at 9-10. \n \n19 Tr. at 80. \n \n20 Government Exhibit 3 (County Sheriff Master File, various dates), at 6. \n \n21 Tr. at 51, 80. \n \n22 Government Exhibit 3, supra note 20, at 6. \n \n23 Applicant Exhibit A (State Department of Justice Record Review, dated July 17, 2008), at 2. \n \n24 Government Exhibit 2, supra note 4, at 4. \n \n25 Id. \n \n26 Id.; Applicant Exhibit A, supra note 23, at 3; Government Exhibit 5 (Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) \nIdentification Record, dated May 13, 2007), at 3. \n \n27 Tr. at 49. \n \n28 Government Exhibit 2, supra note 4, at 3. \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nturned out to be a police officer.29  He was arrested, transported to jail, where he \nremained for nearly 2 days, and charged with (1) possession of a controlled substance, \na felony; and (2) disorderly conduct: prostitution.30 The controlled substance found in \nhis car was methamphetamine.31 He was subsequently convicted of the 2nd charge, and \nsentenced to 24 months probation, a fine, and 3 days (apparently reduced to time \nserved) in jail.32 It is unclear if the remaining charge was dismissed, for there is no court \ndisposition other than \u201cfurther investigation,\u201d listed in the evidence.33 \n \nIn July 1992, according to SOR & 1.d., Applicant was purportedly arrested and \ncharged with robbery, a felony.34 The charge was subsequently dismissed for lack of \nevidence.35 Applicant denied the allegation and disputed the arrest, contending he was \nnever arrested for robbery, and claimed the evidence of such arrest is erroneous.36  No \nfurther evidence is known about this alleged arrest, and, interestingly, it is not listed in \nhis FBI Identification Record.37 \n \nIn July 2004, Applicant decided to relocate from the state where he had \npreviously gotten into trouble. He had become tired of everything that was going on \naround him, including the wrong crowd with whom he was hanging around, the peer \npressure to do things he shouldn\u2019t be doing, the trouble it had caused, and the \nheartache caused his family.38 As a result, the changes have brought about a positive \nattitude and outlook, as well as reduced peer pressure, and he no longer hangs out with \nthe wrong crowd.39 Since the move, he has had no unfavorable involvement with law \nenforcement.40 Moreover, he has vowed never to use illegal substances again,41 and \nbecause of his diabetes, has substantially decreased his alcohol consumption.

At that time, Applicant \nwas with a small group of new hires and they received a very cursory oral instruction on \nhow to complete a questionnaire.43 He cannot recall any written instructions,44 and \naside from the form itself, there is no evidence of any such instructions. Seeking \nadditional guidance on completing some responses, Applicant turned to a colleague, not \nthe facility security officer, and was advised to only go back for seven years.45 Applicant \nfilled out the questionnaire in long hand, without the benefit of any records, relying \nsolely on his memory.46 He signed the questionnaire and submitted it, but did not \ncomplete the form on a computer, and does not know who did so.47 In fact, until he \nreceived a copy of the e-QIP from Department Counsel, he had never seen the \ncomputerized version, a copy of which is in evidence.48  \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant deliberately failed to disclose two aspects of his \npolice record in Section 23 thereof.  The SOR & 2.a. refers to question 23.d. (Have you \never been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?). \nThere is no modifier to that particular question which would limit the reportable period to \nanything less than \u201cever.\u201d49 Applicant answered \u201cYes\u201d to the question and described the \nincidents from SOR && 1.a. (2001 - drugs) and 1.b. (1997 - alcohol).50 He did not \nmention the incident from SOR & 1.c.  (1993 \u2013 drugs).  The Government argues the \nomission of that incident was made deliberately by Applicant, but he denies his \nomission was deliberate or with intent to falsify his police record.  He contends he was \nin a rush to complete the information, and \u201cdid so to the best of [his] ability and what [he] \ncould recall,51 did not have the exact dates and times of past offenses,52 and was under \n \n42 Applicant Exhibit B (Employer Correspondence, dated June 21 and 24, 2008), at 1. \n \n43 Tr. at 59, 68. \n \n44 Id. at 68. \n \n45 Id. at 59-60. \n \n46 Id. at 34-35, 63, 65, 69-70. \n \n47 Id. at 71-72. \n \n48 Id. \n \n49 It should be noted, however, that questions 23.e. and 23.f. do contain such modifiers.  See Government \nExhibit 1, supra note 1, at 32. \n \n50 Id. at 31-33. \n \n51 Tr. at 34. \n \n52 Id. at 35. \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nthe erroneous impression that he was only supposed to list incidents within the past \nseven years.53 After reviewing the e-QIP during the hearing, and upon further reflection, \nApplicant conceded that he \u201cmessed up\u201d in failing to include the other incident.54 While \nApplicant clearly omitted the incident, I find his explanations to be reasonable, and can \nfind no substantial benefit to have been gained by deliberately omitting the oldest \nincident when he had already admitted the two most recent incidents and they covered \nboth alcohol and drugs.  Accordingly, I find Applicant is credible in his denial of \n\u201cdeliberate falsification.\u201d \n \nThe SOR & 2.b. refers to question 23.a. (Have you ever been charged with or \nconvicted of any felony offense?). Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question.55 He did not \nmention the incidents from SOR & 1.c.  (1993 \u2013 dangerous weapon) or SOR & 1.d. \n(1992 \u2013 robbery).  The Government again argues the omissions of those incidents were \nmade deliberately by Applicant, but he again denies these omissions were deliberate or \nwith intent to falsify his police record, and contends, in addition to his other \nexplanations, that he was under the impression that the question referred to \u201cfelony \nconvictions.\u201d56 While Applicant clearly omitted the incidents, I again find his \nexplanations, including the one that he was not aware of any \u201cfelony convictions,\u201d to be \nreasonable. Moreover, as far as SOR & 1.d. is concerned, Applicant consistently \ndisputed the occurrence of the 1992 arrest for robbery, and the FBI Identification \nRecord does not list it. Applicant\u2019s erroneous impressions may be wrong, but that is not \nevidence of deliberate falsification. I find Applicant is credible in his denial of \u201cdeliberate \nfalsification.\u201d \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d57 As Commander in Chief, \nthe President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national \nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access \nto such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his \ndesignee to grant an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon \na finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d58   \n \n \n \n53 I recognize he disclosed the 1997 incident which occurred more than seven years previously.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended \nand modified.    \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d59 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \napplicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, \nextenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s \ncase.  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.60  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as \nwell. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to \nrepose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants \naccess to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation.  Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d61 \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d62 Thus, nothing \n \n59 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd.

It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical \nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30:       \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d is potentially \ndisqualifying. Similarly, under AG \u00b6 31(c), an Aallegation or admission of criminal \nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted,@ may raise security concerns. Applicant\u2019s history of criminal conduct, \ninvolving at least three arrests and three convictions, is documented in his police and \ncourt records, his answers to interrogatories, and the evidence, including his testimony, \npresented during the hearing. The Government has established AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(c).   \n \nThe guidelines also include examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from criminal conduct. Under AG \u00b6 32(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where Aso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.@ In addition, when there is \u201cevidence that the person did not commit the \noffense,\u201d AG \u00b6 32(c) may apply. Similarly, AG \u00b6 32(d) may apply when \u201cthere is \nevidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time \nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement.@  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) apply because Applicant\u2019s alleged criminal conduct (the \n2001 arrest) last occurred approximately eight years ago and there has been no further \nalleged criminal conduct. His illegal substance abuse ceased in 2003, and his \nabstinence has continued for about six years since then. He has clearly exhibited \nremorse, and since turning his life around and avoiding the wrong crowd, he has \nestablished a good employment record with constructive community involvement. \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nAs far as AG \u00b6 32(c), it is really unclear if Applicant was arrested for robbery, for \nwhile he denies the arrest, county police records claim that he was, but FBI records \nrecord no such arrest. I carefully viewed his demeanor and am satisfied that he was not \narrested for robbery in 1992.  This particular criminal offense is unsubstantiated. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15:  \n      \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG \u00b6 16(a), a \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used \nto conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or \nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities,\u201d is potentially disqualifying. Similarly, under AG \u00b6 16(b), \u201cdeliberately \nproviding false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official government \nrepresentative,\u201d may raise security concerns. Applicant\u2019s omissions of critical \ninformation pertaining to arrests, provides sufficient evidence to examine if his omission \nwas a deliberate falsification or was the result of simple oversight or negligence on his \npart.  \n \nThe guidelines also include examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from personal conduct. Under AG \u00b6 17(b), \u201cthe refusal or failure to \ncooperate, omission, or concealment was caused or significantly contributed to by \nimproper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or \ninstructing the individual specifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon \nbeing made aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully,\u201d may apply.  In this instance, while Applicant\u2019s \nomissions were not considered to be deliberate attempts to conceal certain arrests, \nthere appears to have also been some improper or inadequate advice received which \nmisled Applicant. While there is no clear evidence that the advice was from \u201cauthorized \npersonnel,\u201d regardless of the source, Applicant\u2019s state of mind was partially influenced \nby it.  Accordingly, AG \u00b6 17(b) partially applies.  Most importantly, I find that AG \u00b6 17(f), \n\u201cthe information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability,\u201d \napplies. \n \nBased on the evidence, I have already concluded that Applicant credibly stated \nduring his hearing that at the time he completed his Security Clearance Application, he \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \ndid not believe he needed to disclose the information regarding incidents that were \noutside the seven year limit, he was unaware that he had been convicted of a felony, \nand he was never arrested for robbery. I find Applicant is credible in his denial of \ndeliberate falsification.63 \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines J and E in my analysis below.      \n \nWhile in high school, Applicant started hanging around with the wrong crowd and \ndeveloped bad habits. In part, due to peer pressure, he consumed alcohol, sometimes \nto excess, and abused marijuana and methamphetamines. That substance abuse \neventually resulted in some arrests. While some of the charges were dismissed, he was \nconvicted several times and punished. Some of the sentences included probation, \nparticipation in certain rehabilitation or education programs, and brief periods of \nincarceration. \n \nAs bad as things had become, with his 2001 arrest, they took a turn for the \nbetter, and there has been no further negative involvement with law enforcement \nauthorities since that time. Furthermore, in 2003, he decided to abstain from further \ndrug abuse and significantly diminished his alcohol consumption. In July 2004, \nApplicant relocated from the state where he had previously gotten into trouble. He \n \n63 The Appeal Board has explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of proving \nfalsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s \nintent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record \nevidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning the \napplicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally \npermissible for the Judge to conclude Department Counsel had established a prima facie case \nunder Guideline E and the burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to \nexplain the omission. \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \nturned his back on the old crowd and shed his bad habits, and developed a new life and \nlifestyle. The changes have brought about a positive attitude and outlook. Now, there is \nlittle potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress, and the likelihood of \nrecurrence is nil. The change in lifestyle has also had a positive impact on his \nprofessional career. \n \nIt is true that Applicant made poor choices, but those activities occurred in 2001 \nand before, and have not recurred. Using the analogy from the Appeal Board in financial \ncases, Applicant has established a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of good conduct over the \npast eight years, establishing a new life and lifestyle with positive results. These factors \nshow responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. (See AG && 2(a)(2), 2(a)(3), 2(a)(5), \n2(a)(6), 2(a)(7), 2(a)(8), and 2(a)(9).) \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the criminal conduct and \npersonal conduct security concerns.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nhe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n13 \n                                      \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On February 19, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nJ and E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 5, 2008. He answered the\nSOR in writing and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the\ncase assignment on April 8, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 14, 2008,\nand I convened the hearing on May 7, 2008. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1-2,\nwhich were received without objection. Applicant testified in his own behalf and\npresented two witnesses. He submitted Exhibits (AE) A-G, without objection. DOHA\nJune 9, 2008\n\nThe report was not in the record. Applicant was not given a copy at the time of the evaluation. Thus, there\n1\nis no information on what testing was done nor the precise basis for the diagnosis. Applicant reported in his\nSF 86 that he was seen by someone who possesses an MSW  (Master of Social W ork) for the evaluation in\nearly 2003 after his release. This credential (MSW ) is not the same as a licensed clinical psychologist. \n2\nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on May 15, 2008. Based upon a review of the\ncase file, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated March 5, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b of the SOR. He also admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6\n2.a-c of the SOR with explanation (denying its applicability under Guideline E) but\ndenied allegation \u00b6 2.d of the SOR. Applicant provided additional information to support\nhis request for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\ncollege with highest honors in December 2005 (AE B). His degree is in computer\nscience with a minor in mathematics. His grade point average was 4.0 in his major. He\nis single. He has worked for his current employer since 2005 (GE 1).\nApplicant attended a preparatory school before entering the U.S. Naval Academy\nin 1989. Just prior to that time his mother died. He was 16 years old. His mother and\nfather had divorced when he was very young. Thus, he experienced some depression\n(AE D). During his first year at the academy, at the age of 19, he was still grieving his\nmother\u2019s sudden death. He had a stressful first year and experienced pressures. He\nhad trouble with the intensity of the military training. He was not sleeping at night and he\nfelt that he wanted to leave the military setting. He voluntarily spoke to a psychologist on\nthe campus about his difficulties. The military psychologist recommended that Applicant\nbe discharged from the academy due to not being emotionally suited for military service\n(Tr.85). The psychologist believed that Applicant should go home. Applicant agreed that\nhe was not happy in the academy setting. He decided he wanted to go to a regular\ncollege. After Applicant left the academy, he attended a community college for a few\nyears and earned an Associate Degree. He worked while attending the community\ncollege.\nOn May 13, 1992, Applicant shot a man who had raped his girlfriend. His\ngirlfriend told Applicant about the rape and Applicant got a gun and went to the person\u2019s\nhouse and shot him in the chest. He pled nolo contendre (no jury trial) and on\nNovember 13, 1992, he was sentenced to 22 years in prison, probation and restitution\non the charge of Attempted First Degree Murder. He was 21 years old. This was his first\nand only arrest. Applicant spent more than ten years in prison and was released in\nDecember 2002 for good behavior. As part of a court requirement upon his release,\nApplicant underwent a psychological evaluation in early February 2003. He was\ndiagnosed with a non-specific personality disorder with antisocial and narcissistic traits.\nThe diagnosing therapist determined that Applicant did not require any treatment.1\n\nThe certificate of achievement notes that these courses are an intensive and carefully structured series of\n2\nlearning experiences dealing with personal planning, goal setting, communications skills, social skills,\nemotional development, attitude and outlook enhancement. Moreover, the courses involve critical self-\nappraisal and evaluation which culminate in the development of a personal plan.\n3\nDuring his time in prison, Applicant took many courses (AE A). He received a\ncertificate in Vocational Masonry. He completed a series of self-help courses, including\nLife Skills, Vital Issues Project, Family Empowerment Enrichment Program and a\nTransition program.  He attended psychiatric counseling. He was a facilitator for a self-\n2\nhelp group. He worked in the adult basic education classes to help other prisoners (Tr.\n59). He spent 10 years, seven months and sixteen days incarcerated. During that time\nhe did not receive any disciplinary actions. \nIn 2003, Applicant started his courses at university. He took computer science\ncourses. He was an outstanding student who was in regular contact with his academic\nadvisor. She found him to be an excellent student with good people skills. He was a\ndisciplined student who managed his time very well. He worked while attending college\nto support himself. Applicant told his academic advisor that he was a convicted felon.\nShe was quite impressed with him and believes he has much to offer his employer and\nthe defense contract world. His academic advisor held a security clearance and\nrecommended him highly. She was adamant that there is no reason to deny a security\nclearance at this point in time despite his crime. She remarked that Applicant\u2019s\nintelligence, dedication, hard work ethic and knowledge of technology would make him\nan asset to the U.S. (Tr. 49). She also explained that Applicant is one of the only\nstudents she taught to earn a 4.0 as a computer science major.\nApplicant\u2019s academic advisor specifically asked to testify at the hearing in\naddition to providing a sworn statement. She recognizes the impact of obtaining a\nsecurity clearance. She noted in her letter of recommendation for Applicant that \u201cnobody\nwith whom I worked who also had a secret clearance seemed more deserving of this\nrecognition than [Applicant] since I have known him\u201d (AE G).\nApplicant lived with his father, stepmother and grandmother while in college. He\ntook a part time job with a swimming pool company. He worked his way up to a\nmanagement position in the company. He saved money for his education expenses. He\nalso worked part time for the defense contractor that hired him permanently in 2005.\nApplicant was hired as a systems analyst initially in 2005. He immediately told his\nemployer that he was a convicted felon. He works independently but is a valued\nmember of a small team. He is reliable. He is an excellent problem solver. He received\nnumerous compliments from clients. He works very hard (Tr. 35-38). During his three\nyears with the company Applicant has received promotions. He has done an excellent\njob and his evaluations are very good (Tr. 41).\nApplicant\u2019s manager for operations research hired Applicant three years ago. He\nhas worked closely with him on several projects (Tr. 35). He emphasized that Applicant\n\n4\nworks well independently but does not hesitate to ask for assistance when needed.\nApplicant has assisted the manager in presentations of professional materials. Applicant\nalready has access to some sensitive information such as proprietary data and trade\nsecrets (Tr. 40). His final comment was that Applicant was exceptionally reliable (Tr 41).\nApplicant tutors students in college level math, science and computer courses.\nHe does this as a volunteer. He views this as a way to give something back to society.\nApplicant acknowledges that he very much regrets what he did in 1992 - almost 16\nyears ago. He hurt someone and destroyed many lives. He threw his whole life off track\nand hurt the people who cared for him. He does not excuse his behavior. He believed\nhe committed the crime in response to the trauma of his girlfriend\u2019s rape. He has\nlearned from this grave mistake (Tr. 57-58). \nApplicant pays restitution to his victim and his family as part of his probation. He\nwas ordered to pay restitution to the hospital in the amount of $41,517 and $11,855 to\nthe victim. Applicant has 13 more years of probation. However, his understanding is that\nonce he finishes his restitution payments he will not remain on probation. Currently, he\npays approximately $260 a month. (AE C) He has doubled the payments over the past\n14 months. The balance is now $33,608. \nApplicant underwent psychological testing on April 18, 2008 by a licensed clinical\npsychologist. He completed the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory - Second\nEdition (MMPI-2). The MMPI-2 is an objective personality assessment designed to help\nidentify personal, social, and behavioral problems (AE D). The testing revealed that he\nis extroverted, sociable, gregarious, and friendly. The profile was within normal limits.\nHe seems to maintain a healthy balance in his approach to life. His profile indicated that\nhe responded in a forthright manner and may therefore be viewed as a reliable and\naccurate measurement of his current functioning. He describes himself as being happy,\nhealthy and contented. He does not report any type of emotional distress. He did not\nclinically elevate scales associated with paranoia, undue suspicion, lack of empathy,\ncurrent disdain for authority, antisocial problems, depression, anxiety, mania or\naggression (AE D). Applicant will seek counseling with this therapist when the need\narises or he feels pressures (Tr. 94).\nIn October 2006, Applicant was interviewed as part of the security clearance\nprocess. He explained to the interviewer that he writes to a 70-year-old man in prison\nwho was kind to him when he was in prison. He does not call him or visit him (Tr. 73). At\nthe hearing, he explained his reasons for the pen-pal relationship. It provides value for\nboth men. Applicant provided the name of this gentleman on his security clearance\napplication under Section 12. Since he spent a decade incarcerated, he decided to list\nthis fellow inmate. Applicant believed this would give the investigators an opportunity to\nspeak with him regarding Applicant. At the hearing, Applicant noted that if necessary, he\nwould discontinue his written exchanges with this inmate. However, his friend is in poor\nhealth and Applicant enjoys sending him letters to share his progress. He believes his\nletters give the inmate hope.\n\n5\nOn cross examination, Applicant related that he at first thought of suicide when\nhis girl friend was raped. He tried to explain his feelings at the time of the crime. He did\nnot want the man who raped his friend to be free and walking around (Tr. 75). He also\nexplained that he cannot justify what he did. He knows this was irrational behavior (AE\nE). His girl friend did not report the rape to the police and he related that he just\nexploded. He also explained that the judge sentenced him to the maximum time in\nprison. \nApplicant\u2019s probation officer now requires him to phone in several times a month.\nThe senior probation officer does not require Applicant to physically present himself to\nthe office anymore. This reduction in level of supervision is due to Applicant\u2019s continued\ncompliance and no violation of rules in his probation (Tr. 100). His probation officer\nnoted that even with the relaxed terms of supervision, Applicant has continued to\nmaintain compliance (AE F).\nApplicant presented many letters of recommendation frm professors, colleagues,\nfriends, family and a senior associate from his current employment. The senior\nassociate commended Applicant on his dedication during his past three years of\nemployment. Applicant works nights and weekends to complete a project. He is a\ntalented and respected computer professional (AE G). Each letter attests to Applicant\u2019s\ncandor, honesty, and willingness to comply with rules and regulations.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n6\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in\nAG & 30, \u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 31(a), an Asingle serious crime or multiple lesser offenses@ may be potentially\ndisqualifying.  Similarly under AG & 31(d), A an individual who is currently on parole or\nprobation@ may raise security concerns. As noted above, Applicant admits he committed\na felony crime in May 1992. He was sentenced to prison (22 years) for the charge of\nAttempted First Degree Murder. He served almost 11 years in prison. He is on probation\nand he is still paying his court-ordered restitution. These facts are sufficient to raise\nthese potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from criminal conduct. Under AG \u00b6 32(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Aso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.@ Applicant=s criminal conduct occurred almost 16 years ago when he was 21\n\n7\nyears old. He said he reacted to the rape of his girlfriend. He was released from prison\nalmost six years ago (for good behavior) and is on supervised probation. This potentially\nmitigating condition is a factor for consideration in this case. \nUnder AG & 30(d), it may be mitigating where A there is evidence of successful\nrehabilitation; including, but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of\ncriminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good\nemployment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d As noted above, Applicant\nwas released from prison for good behavior after serving more than ten years of his\nsentence. He has completed his college education. He has a very good position with his\ncompany. His supervisor highly recommends him. He volunteers in the community. He\nhas undergone psychological testing. He is making restitution for his crime to his victim\nand the hospital. He deeply regrets his irrational reaction to the rape of his girlfriend. He\nacknowledges that he harmed many lives. I find this potentially mitigating condition\napplies in this case. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate with\nthe security clearance process.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 16(c):\ncredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not\nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline,\nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person\nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard\nprotected information.\nApplicant was administratively discharged from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1989.\nHe was a midshipman fourth class. He volunteered to see a psychologist because he\nfelt depressed, was grieving his mother\u2019s death and could not handle the strain of the\nmilitary setting. He did not display unbecoming conduct. He agreed with the\npsychologist that he was not emotionally suited to the military setting at that time. I do\nnot find that this raises a disqualifying condition under this section.\n\n8\nSimilarly, under AG \u00b6 16(d):\ncredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any\nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse\ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available\ninformation supports a whole-person assessment of questionable\njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, \nlack \nof \ncandor,\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly\nsafeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited to\nconsideration of: (1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior....\nApplicant shot a man with a gun for which he spent time in prison. Thus, AG \u00b6\n16(d) applies because this shows unreliability and poor judgment.  After his crime and\nhis time in prison, Applicant was court-ordered to receive a psychological evaluation\nupon his immediate release. Applicant did not see a copy of the report of that\nevaluation. The alleged diagnosis is somewhat diminished because the basis for the\ndiagnosis and testing is no known nor is it in the record evidence. Applicant met with the\npsychologist several times and discussed his past along with the prison experience and\nhis transition to society. Applicant was not determined to need treatment after his\nrelease in December 2002. It is now almost six years later and his licensed clinical\npsychologist finds his profile, based on the MMPI-2, within normal limits. He did not\nclinically elevate scales associated with antisocial problems or aggression. \nApplicant writes to an inmate in the prison where he spent more than ten years of\nhis life.  He does not visit him nor call him. He believes that his letters encourage the\nman and give him hope. The man is 70 years old and in poor health.\nAG \u00b6 16(e) \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s\nconduct that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation or duress, such as (1)\nengaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or\ncommunity standing.\u201d This disqualifying condition is not a factor for consideration\nbecause Applicant has told his employer and others about the crime and his time in\nprison. He has taken the positive steps of disclosure, eliminating his vulnerability to\nexploitation, manipulation or duress. I do not believe he would compromise national\nsecurity to avoid public disclosure of his crime or conduct.\nParagraph 17 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Specifically,\nAG \u00b6 17(c) \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not case doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgement\u201d is a factor for consideration in this case. Moreover, AG \u00b617(d) \u201cthe individual\nhas acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or\ntaken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances or factors that\ncaused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is\n\n9\nunlikely to recur\u201d does apply. Applicant\u2019s emotional status in 1989 and his evaluation in\n2003 do not reflect inappropriate behavior or poor judgment. Applicant has rehabilitated\nhimself and has acknowledged his crime and is paying restitution to the victim. His\nrecent psychological evaluation underscores the positive steps he has taken to ensure\nthat criminal conduct does not occur again. Moreover, since the 2002 release from\nprison Applicant has not had any behavioral problems. He has been gainfully employed\nand has a better perception of how to avoid future problematic situations. Thus, AG\n17(e) \u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to\nexploitation, manipulation, or duress\u201d is a factor for consideration.  He has mitigated any\npersonal conduct concerns through his recent actions and behavior. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant committed a grave crime\nin 1992 when he was 21 years old. He intentionally got a gun and shot the man who he\nsays raped his girlfriend. He was convicted of Attempted First Degree Murder. He\nserved more than ten years of his 22 year sentence. Applicant does not excuse his\ncrime. He was diagnosed in early 2003 (just after his release in December 2002) with a\nnon-specific personality disorder with antisocial and narcissistic traits. \nHowever, Applicant received counseling during his years in prison. He also\navailed himself of many self help programs. He tutored other inmates. He facilitated\ngroups. He did not receive any disciplinary infractions while in prison. He was released\non probation in 2002 for good behavior. \nApplicant returned to college after his early release for good behavior. He\nreceived the highest honors upon graduation in 2005. He completed his computer\nscience major and earned a 4.0 grade average. He worked to pay for his education. He\nwas hired in 2005 by a defense contractor. He has received promotions and earned the\nrespect of his supervisors and colleagues as well. Applicant tutors other students. \n\nSee Attorney Sheldon I. Cohen\u2019s 2008 article on the repeal of the Smith Amendment at\n3\nwww.sheldoncohen.com/publications. \n10\nApplicant is paying restitution to the victim and is paying the hospital bills. He has\ndoubled his payment during the past 14 months. He reports to his probation officer by\nphone. He has not violated any conditions of his probation during the past five years.\nApplicant was recently evaluated by a clinical psychologist. He presented in a healthy\nmanner and did not show signs of paranoia, disdain for authority, antisocial problems or\naggression. He has met his burden of proof in this case to overcome the government\u2019s\ncase.\nApplicant\u2019s parents divorced when he was young. His mother died when he was\nsixteen. Applicant\u2019s depression and difficulties during his time at the Naval Academy are\nrelated to her death. He was not emotionally suited to the military setting in 1989 when\nhe was a young man. He has received psychological counseling and evaluations as\nrequired. His most recent psychological evaluation confirms that he is now coping with\nstress and is living a healthy life. \nIn addition, Applicant began his education by attending a navy preparatory\nschool and followed that by enlisting in the Navy. He earned admission to the U.S.\nNaval Academy. He wanted to serve his country. \nOn January 28, 2008, the President signed into law Public Law 110-181, the\nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, Section 1072 which repealed\n10 U.S.C. Section 986, formerly known as the Smith Amendment. In doing so,\nCongress lifted the automatic ban to those who had been convicted of a crime and\nserved more than one year of incarceration. Originally, 10 U.S.C. Section 986 barred\nanyone from holding a security clearance if convicted of an offense and sentenced to at\nleast a year regardless of whether they were allowed to serve community service and\nnever spent a day in jail. The effect was to cause numerous long-standing excellent\nemployees to lose their clearances, and thus their jobs, even if convicted of an offense\nmany years before.3\nCongress has grappled with this weighty issue over the years. Recognizing the\ninjustice of this law, it has been changed. The intent is to decide on a case by case\nanalysis if an Applicant has overcome the past criminal record and is rehabilitated.\nHaving considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in evaluating Applicant\u2019s risk vulnerability\nin protecting our national interest, I find Applicant has made sufficient progress to\nmitigate the criminal and personal conduct security concerns.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his personal\nconduct and criminal conduct. \n\n11\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a-b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a-d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On March 17, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the\ncase assignment on May 20, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 30, 2008,\nand I convened the hearing as scheduled on June 19, 2008. The government offered\nExhibits (GE) 1 through 5 which were received without objection. Applicant testified on\nher own behalf. She also submitted Exhibits (AE) A through E. Department Counsel had\nno objection to the exhibits. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on June\nJuly 28, 2008\n\n2\n27, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated April 21, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a- 1.h of the SOR. Applicant provided additional information to\nsupport her request for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor. Applicant graduated\nfrom high school in 1976 (Tr. 31). Applicant has been employed in her current position\nsince May 1981. She is technical support (assembler) for her employer (Tr. 16). She\nalso has a seasonal part-time job.\nApplicant has been widowed since 2005 (GE 1). She has a grown daughter and\nthree grandchildren. Applicant married her husband when she was 17 years old. She\nand her husband had a difficult marriage due to his drinking problems. Applicant\u2019s\nhusband was verbally abusive to her. He also had health problems due to his drinking.\nApplicant decided to leave her husband and move to another state in November 2001.\nShe was able to continue her employment with the same company.\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began when she moved out of her husband\u2019s\nhome to work in another state. They had not paid federal income taxes from 1995 until\n1999. He used his money for his drinking habit. Applicant and her husband had\narranged to make payments with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). When Applicant\nmoved out of the house, her husband stopped making the payments. The IRS\ngarnished Applicant\u2019s wages in September 2002. The levy was satisfied in May 2003.\nAll the money was taken from Applicant\u2019s pay check leaving her with a minimal amount.\nSOR \u00b6 1.a is a garnishment for federal taxes not paid by Applicant and her\nhusband for the 1995-1999 years. This levy on her wages began in September 2002\nand terminated in May 2003.\nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a medical account for $164. This debt originated with x-rays that\nApplicant needed in conjunction with her gall bladder problems. This account is paid\n(AE A).\nSOR \u00b6 1.c is another medical account for $1,090. This debt originated with\nApplicant\u2019s emergency surgery for gall bladder problems. The account is paid (AE A). \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is an unnamed medical account for $41.25. This account is paid (AE\nA). \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is a medical account for $143. This account is paid (AE B).\n\n3\nSOR \u00b6 1.f is for a credit card account that is charged off in the amount of $794.\nThis account is paid (AE C). \nSOR \u00b6 1.g is for a credit card account that is charged off in the amount of $8,530.\nApplicant charged hotel, rental car, and other daily expenses when she moved from her\nhome to another state. This account is not paid (GE 3). \nSOR 1.h is for a charged off account for $1,990. Applicant purchased furniture for\nher apartment when she moved out of her home in 2001. This account is not paid.\nApplicant completed a thirteen-week financial counseling course. However, she\ncontinues to attend classes until she is debt free. She has a plan to pay off her bills. Not\nonly is she using the $400 that she has left after expenses, but she is taking any money\nthat she makes from her part-time job and using that to reduce her debts (Tr. 53). She is\nsaving money and she uses a budget (Tr. 29). Applicant may take another hardship\nloan and pay the largest debt. She is looking for someone to share her apartment to\nreduce her rent. She plans to pay the remaining debt in one year. Applicant lives\nfrugally. After 23 years she finally bought a new car. She is current on her monthly\npayment of $166 for her new vehicle. Her credit report confirms that she is in good\nstanding with other accounts (GE 3).\nApplicant\u2019s current monthly net income is approximately $2,601. After monthly\ndeductions and expenses, she has a net remainder of approximately $400 a month to\nhelp pay her debts (Tr. 53). She now pays her bills as soon as they are due.\nApplicant took a hardship loan from her 401(k) retirement money. She used that\nmoney to pay bills. She plans to do another hardship loan so that she can more quickly\npay off her largest remaining debt.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\n\n4\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\n\n5\nsecurity concerns. Applicant had delinquent debts that total about $13,000. She also\nhad her wages garnished in 2002 for failure to pay federal income taxes. The evidence\nis sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial problems were partially a result of her separation from her husband. Since that\ntime, she has paid the taxes due from her wages. She has also paid all but two of the\ndebts listed in the SOR. This potentially mitigating condition applies in part. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above,\nApplicant\u2019s husband contributed to the financial problems that evolved. Applicant was\nsteadily employed. She also had some medical problems that resulted in bills. I find that\nthis mitigating condition applies in part.\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant completed a 13-week counseling program and\ncontinues to receive counseling. She paid medical accounts and a charged off credit\naccount. She borrowed against her retirement funds to pay the credit account. She has\nshown good faith with her creditors. I conclude these potentially mitigating conditions\napply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c) the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\n\n6\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant is a hardworking person.\nShe has been employed for the past 27 years with her employer. She has no incidents\nor problems with them. She married quite young and her marriage was a difficult one.\nHer husband\u2019s drinking caused financial problems in the marriage. He did not pay\nfederal taxes for the years 1995-1999. Applicant made an arrangement with the IRS to\npay the taxes, but when she moved out of her husband\u2019s house, he stopped paying the\namount. Applicant\u2019s wages were garnished and the tax levy was completely paid in\n2003. She is now widowed and living on her own. She paid several medical accounts\nand a charged off credit account. She took a financial planning course and has a budget\nand savings. She took a hardship loan to help pay the one credit account. She does not\nlive beyond her means. She plans to pay the remaining debt with her net monthly\nremainder and if necessary, take another hardship loan against her retirement. She has\nmet her burden of proof in this case to overcome the government\u2019s case. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nHistory of Case\nOn July 25, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant\nto Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, and\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, issued a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and\nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on August 27. 2008, and elected to have his\ncase decided on the basis of the written record.  Applicant received the File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM) on September 18, 2008.  Applicant did not submit any information in\nresponse to the FORM.  The case was assigned to me on November 14, 2008.\nDecember 30, 2008\n\n                                                                                                                2\nProcedural Issues\nBoth SOR and Department Counsel contend that the covered allegations of drug\nuse rightfully invoke application of the per se bar of the Bond Amendment (viz., Section\n3002 of 50 U.S.C. \u00b6 435b).  Applicant provides no rebuttal to these Bond contentions in\nhis answer.  As shown infra, the Bond Amendment\u2019s explicit statutory prohibition against\ngranting security clearances to unlawful drug users and addicts under Adjudicative\nGuideline (AG) H has potential application to the facts of this case Whether or not the\nexclusion is invoked will depend on how Applicant\u2019s use frequency is considered recent\nunder the statutory requirements of the Bond Amendment and its implementing\nguidelines. \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline H, Applicant is alleged to (a) have used marijuana\napproximately 50 times from September 2003 through October 2006, (b) have used\nmarijuana approximately 5 times from around March 2007 through July 2007, even\nthough he has applied for a DoD security clearance in March 2007, (c) have used\nmarijuana approximately 3 times around November 2007 in connection with his security\nclearance application, (d) have purchased approximately $25.00 per month worth of\nmarijuana from approximately September 2003 through September 2006, and (e) to be\ndisqualified from having a security clearance by virtue of Public Law 110-181 (the Bond\nAmendment).  Allegations of use of marijuana while applying for a security clearance\nare incorporated under Guideline E.\nFor his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations.  He\nclaimed infrequent and declining use of marijuana.  He claimed his spouse has not\nrenewed her prescription for medical marijuana, which means he can no longer legally\npurchase the substance as her caretaker.  He claimed he no longer associates with\nanyone who can provide any illegal marijuana.  \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 53-year-old software engineer for a defense contractor who seeks\na security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant\nare adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nBetween September 2003 and October 2006, Applicant smoked marijuana\napproximately 50 times.  He reduced his marijuana use somewhat after October 2006:\nHe estimates he smoked the substance only five times between March 2007 and July\n2007 (see exs. 6 and 7).  He admits to continuing to use marijuana even after applying\nfor a security clearance in March 3007.  After he suffered a heart attack in April 2007 he\nreduced his marijuana use to once every two to three weeks (see ex. 6).  Albeit, his wife\ncontinued using marijuana for medicinal purposes (ex. 6).  When Applicant smoked\nmarijuana. He did so at home with his wife for pleasure and relaxation.  He purchased\nthe substance for the personal needs of his wife and himself, spending around $25.00 a\nmonth (see ex. 7).  Although he assured the investigator from the Office of Personnel\nmanagement (OPM) who interviewed him in August 2007 that he would not use\n\n                                                                                                                 3\nmarijuana or any other illegal substance in the future, he resumed his usage in\nNovember 2007.  Between November 2007 and June 2008, he used marijuana on\napproximately five separate occasions (see  ex. 8).  \nApplicant is physically active (see ex. 6).  He does aerobic exercises at a local\ngym and surfs on the weekends (ex. 6).  Applicant provided no documentation in his\nbehalf to support any further progress in the resolution of his drug usage.  He  provided\nno endorsements or performance evaluations either.  \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\"\nif any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nDrug Involvement\nThe Concern: Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription\ndrug \ncan \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \nreliability \nand\ntrustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it\nraises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with\nlaws, rules, and regulations  AG \u00b6 24.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe \nConcern: \nConduct \ninvolving \nquestionable \njudgment,\nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \ndishonesty, \nor\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  See AG, \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a\n\n                                                                                                                            4\nthreshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires administrative judges to make a common sense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility\nfor a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\njudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nBetween September 2003 and at least June 2008, Applicant used and purchased\nmarijuana on what must be described as a regular and recurrent basis. His admission to\nusing marijuana after applying for a security clearance raises security concerns not only\nabout his continued drug use, but judgment issues as well, given his declination to cease\nhis use of a substance he knew to violate established DoD drug policy requirements.\nBecause he continued using marijuana so close to the date of issuance of the SOR in\nJuly 2008, his drug use also raises the potential for applying the per se prohibition of the\nBond Amendment for concluded drug users.\nApplication of Bond Amendment to Applicant\u2019s drug usage\nBefore January 2008, certain types of conduct were subject to mandatory\nprohibitions against the granting of security clearances under the Smith Amendment (10\nU.S.C. \u00a7 986).  Conduct subject to the Smith Amendment\u2019s prohibition included ongoing\ndrug usage or addiction.  However, this section of the U.S. Code, which applied only to\nsecurity clearances granted by DoD, was repealed on January 28, 2008, when the\nPresident signed the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2008 into law.\nThe previous Smith Amendment provisions were replaced by adding Section 2002 to 50\nU.S.C. \u00a7 435b (known as the Bond Amendment), which applies throughout the Federal\nGovernment (not just DoD anymore).  \nSection 3002 as it applies to drug users precludes the head of a Federal agency\nfrom granting or renewing a security clearance \u201cfor a covered person who is an unlawful\nuser of a controlled substance or an addict (as defined in section 102(1)) of the\n\n                                                                                                                            5\nControlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802) (see ex. 9).  Unlike its other legislative\ncounterparts that cover persons convicted of a crime, persons discharged or dismissed\nfrom the Armed Forces under dishonorable conditions, or persons determined to be\nmentally incompetent, the drug user prohibition in the Bond Amendment includes\ncollateral clearances and provides for no waiver authority (see ex. 9).\nTo be sure, the Bond Amendment\u2019s drug user prohibition provides no definitions\nof the term \u201cdrug user.\u201d  In June 2008, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence)\nissued a clarifying memorandum (USD memorandum) providing interim guidance for\nimplementation of the Bond Amendment (see ex. 10).. This memorandum set forth\nguidance for adjudicators, department counsel and administrative judges to assess the\npotential application of the Bond Amendment to security clearance determinations and\nrequirements for \u201cException\u201d identification of persons subject to its limitations in the Joint\nAdjudication management System (JAMS) if a collateral clearance is granted.  For\npurposes of the unlawful user prohibition in the Bond Amendment, the memorandum\ndescribed an \u201cunlawful user of a controlled substances\u201d as (a)  a person who uses a\ncontrolled substance and has lost the power of self-control and (b) any person who is a\ncurrent user of the controlled substance in a manner other than as prescribed by a\nlicensed physician.  Current use is not limited to the use of a drugs on a particular day, or\nwithin a matter of days or weeks before, but rather enough usage to indicate the\nindividual \u201cis actively engaged in such conduct\u201d (see ex. 10).  \nStill, the USD memorandum does not provide any bright lines for determining\nfrequency patterns and contemporaneous use parameters relative to applicants with\nsecurity clearances or pending clearance applications.  This is a potential problem for\ndetermining where to draw boundaries for applying per se prohibitions for established\ndrug users under the Bond Amendment.  We need not reach precise boundary limits in\nthis case, though, for the Government has established a prima facie case for applying\nthe Bond Amendment\u2019s drug user prohibitions to Applicant\u2019s case specific\ncircumstances.  \nBy all accounts, Applicant\u2019s continuous and recurrent use of marijuana to within\nseveral weeks of the issuance of the SOR in this case to fall within the Bond\nAmendment\u2019s prohibition on drug users absent any persuasive contrary authority from\nApplicant.  Invoking the drug user prohibition in these circumstances serves to bar\nApplicant from being granted a security clearance on a per se basis.  Applicant has\nprovided no documented reasons why the Amendment\u2019s prohibition should not be\napplied to his situation.\nApplicant\u2019s drug abuse history and Bond Amendment application\nOver a five-year period, Applicant used marijuana on a virtually continuous basis,\npurchasing enough to meet the personal needs of himself and his wife.  He currently\nuses marijuana and reports a last use about a month before the issuance of the SOR.\nWith so many returns to marijuana use after commitments to abstain, and lacking in any\nreliable track history of drug use avoidance, too much doubt and uncertainty exist to\nmake safe predictable judgments about his ability to avoid recurrent drug involvement. \n\n                                                                                                                            6\nOn the strength of the evidence presented, several disqualifying conditions of the\nAdjudicative Guidelines for drug abuse are applicable: DC \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d\nDC \u00b6 25(c), \u201cillegal possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase,\nsale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia,\u201d and DC \u00b6 25(h), \u201cexpressed\nintent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to\ndiscontinue drug use.\u201d  Afforded an opportunity to respond to the FORM materials,\nApplicant did not reply. \nJudgment concerns exist over Applicant\u2019s continued drug use after applying for a\nsecurity clearance in March 2007.  These actions reflect both serious judgment lapses\nand disregard of the DoD\u2019s rules and policies for clearance holders.  Applicant\u2019s actions\nare expressly covered by Guideline E, and are entitled to independent cognizance under\nthis Guideline according to the Appeal Board.  See ISCR Case No. 06-20964, at 6 (April\n10, 2008).  Where (as here) there is additional probative adverse information covered by\nGuideline E that is not covered by Guideline H, and vice versa, and which reflects a\nrecurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility or emotionally unstable\nbehavior, independent grounds do exist for considering questionable judgment and\ntrustworthiness allegations under Guideline E, as well as Guideline H.  Authority for\nconsidering overlapping conduct under both guidelines is contained in the guidance\nprovided in Enclosure 2, \u00b6 2(d) of the Directive\u2019s August 2006 amendments. \nSo, under Guideline E, core judgment and trustworthiness concerns covered by\nD.C. \u00b6 16(d), \u201ccredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other\nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which,\nwhen combined with all available information supports a whole-person assessment of\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may\nnot properly safeguard protected information,\u201d are applicable in this case\nBecause of the Bond Amendment\u2019s mandatory preclusion of clearance eligibility\nfor anyone determined to be an illegal drug user (see Sec. 3002 of 50 U.S. \u00a7 435b),\nApplicant, by virtue of his determined current illegal use of marijuana, is barred from\ncontinued access to classified information without regard to any extenuating or mitigating\ncircumstances that might be found in his behalf.  Further, in view of his continuous and\nrecurrent history use of marijuana, even after he applied for a security clearance and\neven despite past promises to abstain, considerable time in demonstrated abstinence\nwould be required  without the mandatory preclusive effects of the Bond Amendment. \nFrom a whole person perspective, Applicant has established no independent\nprobative evidence in this administrative record to warrant any different conclusions\nunder the whole person concept in the Directive.  He has provided no endorsements\nfrom supervisors and coworkers with his employer to soften or mitigate any of the drug\nand judgment concerns associated with his ongoing use of marijuana. \nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s\ndrug use and judgment lapses, Applicant does not mitigate security concerns related to\nhis drug use and personal conduct issues.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect\nto the allegations covered by Guidelines H and E.\n\n                                                                                                                            7\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E2(a) factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE H: (DRUG INVOLVEMENT):         AGAINST APPLICANT\n   \nSub-paras. 1.b through 1.e:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE E: (PERSONAL CONDUCT):         AGAINST APPLICANT\n   \nSub-para. 1.a:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

The\ncase was assigned to me on September 16, 2010, and was scheduled for hearing on\nOctober 14, 2010.  A hearing was held on the scheduled date for the purpose of\nconsidering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant,\nJanuary 14, 2011\n\n2\ncontinue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance. At the hearing, the\nGovernment's case consisted of eight exhibits (GEs 1 through 8); Applicant relied on two\nwitnesses (including himself) and three exhibits. (AEs A-C) The transcript (Tr.) was\nreceived on October 29, 2010. \nProcedural Issues and Rulings\nAt the outset of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to strike subparagraph\n1.d (both independently and as incorporated in subparagraph 2.c) and 1.c of 2.c of the\nSOR. Department Counsel also moved to add subparagraph 1.i to subparagraph 2.c of\nthe SOR.  For good cause shown, the Government\u2019s motion was granted.\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to\nafford him the opportunity to supplement the record with documentation of his approved\nearly release of his probation associated with a covered arrest and conviction.  For good\ncause shown, applicant was granted 14 days to explore steps to obtain documentation of\nan early release of his probation. Department Counsel was afforded three days to\nrespond. Within the permitted time, Applicant provided documentation of his early\nrelease from his probation conditions associated with his 2006 conviction for domestic\nviolence. Applicant\u2019s submission was admitted as AE D.    \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline J, Applicant is alleged to have been arrested and charged on\nmultiple occasions between 1984 and March 2006: (a) in 1984 for possession of\ncontrolled substance and convicted; (b) in 1984 for driving with suspended license\n(drugs/alcohol) and convicted; (c) in 1985 for burglary; (d) in 1986 for driving under the\ninfluence (DUI); (e) in 1988 for inflict injury upon child; (f) in March 1988 for willful cruelty\nto a child and convicted; (g) in 1990 for felony wilful cruelty to child and convicted; (h) in\n1993 for investigation for cruelty to a child, and, as a result, for violation of probation; and\n(i) in March 2006 for corporal injury to spouse/co-habitant/child\u2019s parent and battery:\nsimple and convicted.\nUnder Guideline G, Applicant is alleged to have (a) consumed alcohol at times to\nexcess and to the point of intoxication from his teenage years to at least 2006; (b)\nreceived outpatient alcohol abuse treatment from March 2006 to June 2006 at K facility;\nand (c) abused alcohol as alleged in subparagraphs 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.h (since stricken\nand replaced with 1.i).\nUnder Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have (i) falsified material facts in a July\n2004 interview with a DoD investigator re: his arrest history, and (ii) falsified material\nfacts in an April 2007 DoD interview re: his arrest history.\nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations covering his\nalleged arrests and alcohol abuse, but denied any intention to omit material facts in his\nDoD interviews. He added explanations to some of his answers. Responding to the\n\n3\nallegations covered by Guideline J, he claimed he was innocent of any burglary in\nconnection with his alleged 1985 arrest, despite a conviction in the matter. He claimed\nthe allegations covered by subparagraphs 1.e and 1.f are related.  He claimed the child\ncruelty charges that resulted from a 1993 investigation were based on false allegations\nreported by his ex-girlfriend, and were dismissed. And he claimed his alleged March\n2006 arrest and conviction on domestic violence charges are alcohol-related. In\nresponding to the allegations covered by Guideline G, he claimed he had to stop KP\ntreatment because of conflicts with the days and times available to him.  And, in\nresponse to the allegations covered by Guideline E, he claimed again that the underlying\nallegations covered by Guideline E were false and dismissed.\n      \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 50-year-old maintenance facility technician of a defense contractor\nwho seeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by\nApplicant are adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nBackground\nApplicant experienced a difficult childhood while growing up. He seldom saw his\nmother or father. (GEs 3 and 4) He has limited post-high school schooling. He attended\na vocational school for six months between January and June 1997, and earned an\nengineering certificate. (GE 1)\nApplicant married W1 in October 1981. He has one child from this marriage, and\ndivorced his wife in September 1986. (GEs 1 and 3) His daughter from this marriage\nlived with W1 while growing up.  Since her mother passed away, she has lived on her\nown. (Tr. 138-139) Applicant has not maintained any contact with this daughter. (Tr. 155)\nBetween 1986 and 1990, Applicant lived with a girlfriend and has two children\n(girls, ages 22 and 21, respectively) from this relationship. (see (GE 1; Tr. 154-155)  One\nof his daughters serves in the Air Force; the other is a mother who currently does not\nwork. (Tr. 155)  Besides their two children, his girlfriend had a young son who resided\nwith them. (see GE 7)  He and his girlfriend separated in 1990. (GE 4)\nWhile in high school. Applicant was introduced to alcohol. (see GEs 3 and 4 and\nAE B; Tr. 116).  Between 1977 and 1985, he consumed alcohol regularly, and often to\nexcess and to the point of intoxication. (GEs 3, 4, and 7; Tr. 116-118, 129). He quit\ndrinking altogether in 1985 to provide a better example for his daughter and prove to\nhimself he was not an alcoholic. (Tr. 99, 129-130) Believing at the time he was not an\nalcoholic and could safely drink at controlled levels, Applicant resumed drinking in 2001,\nmostly in social situations with W2. (Tr. 100) Within a couple of years, though, he\nincreased his drinking to excessive levels, and to the point of intoxication. (GEs 3 and 4;\nAE C; Tr. 98) His medical records revealed that he and W2 consumed up to a fifth of\nTequila daily between themselves while at home, and to the point of intoxication. (see\nAE C) Applicant agrees with this medical account. (Tr. 98)\n\n4\nBesides consuming alcohol excessively between 1977 and 1985, Applicant\nsmoked marijuana frequently during this same period, and snorted methamphetamine as\nwell from age 24 to age 28. (see GE 7) He last used methamphetamines in September\n1990.  \nApplicant\u2019s arrest history\nFBI information reports list three Applicant arrests between 1984 and 1985 on\nvarious grounds. In April 1984, he was arrested and convicted of the charge of\npossession of a controlled substance. (Tr. 74-75)  For this charge, he was placed on 36\nmonths probation and fined. (see GE 4 and 5) Shortly thereafter, in June 1984, he was\narrested and charged with driving on a suspended license (drugs/alcohol). He was found\nguilty and sentenced to 180 days in jail, placed on three years court probation, and fined\n$680. (see GEs 3 and 7)  \nIn June 1985, Applicant was arrested and charged with burglary. (GE 5)  A vehicle\non a highway that Applicant stopped to check was burglarized. Applicant denies any\nknowledge or responsibility for the burglary (Tr. 78), but was convicted of the charge on\nthe apparent strength of an eyewitness\u2019s account of spotting him at the roadside scene\nwhere Applicant had stopped.\nIn March 1988, Applicant was arrested and charged with wilful cruelty to a child\nand injury to a child. (GE 5; Tr. 82-83). On the day of his arrest, Applicant and his\ngirlfriend were arguing, which prompted a neighbor to call police. (GE 4). During their\nargument, Applicant noted that her young son had wet the bed. (GE 4). Applicant took\nthe boy to the bathroom to clean up, and when he returned, he found the boy urinating\non the floor. (see GE 4; Tr. 84-85, 90-91) (GE 4). Applicant was subsequently arrested\nby investigating police and charged with wilful cruelty to a child and injury to a child. The\ncourt found him guilty of the charges and sentenced him to 365 days in jail (suspended),\nplaced him on five years of probation, and ordered him to obtain psychological and\nparental counseling. (see GEs 4 and 7) Applicant attended parental counseling classes\nfor six months in 1988, and was enrolled in a drug diversion program during the same\ntime frame.  (see GE 7) \nWhile still on probation, Applicant was involved in a second incident of child\nabuse.  In 1990, Applicant was arrested at his home for spanking his son while he was\nstill on probation for a prior arrest (Tr. 93)  On the day of his arrest, he was home with\nthe woman with whom he was living when her eight-year-old son from another\nrelationship (Tr. 140-141) ran from the front yard of their apartment to the adjacent\nstreet. (GE 4; Tr. 90-93). Applicant pursued him and yelled at the boy to return. When\nthe young boy returned to him as he ordered, he spanked him on the rear and directed\nhim to return to their apartment. (GE 4). The boy obeyed Applicant, and there were no\nother incidents with the boy.  However, the boy informed his father of what Applicant had\ndone to him, and the police came out to Applicant\u2019s home to investigate. (GE 4). Upon\ntaking a report of the incident from his girlfriend, investigating police arrested Applicant\nand charged him with felony wilful cruelty to a child and infliction of injury upon a child.\n\n5\nApplicant was found guilty of one count of inflicting injury upon a child.  The court, in turn,\nsentenced him to 365 days in jail, placed him on five years of probation, and fined him.\n(see GEs 4 and 5) Applicant served eight months of his sentence in jail before being\ngranted an early release for good behavior. (GE 4) With his release, he was permitted to\ncontinue with his probation, which he completed in May 1996. (GE 7)\nBetween 1991 and 1996, Applicant was assigned to a local probation officer.\nRecords show that Applicant enrolled in counseling in September 1991 and maintained\npoor attendance throughout 1991 and 1992. (see GE 7)  Periodically, he was warned by\nhis probation officer that his missing counseling sessions could jeopardize his probation\nstatus, and would be reported to the court, if they persisted. (GE 7) Applicant was\ncontinuously admonished by his probation officer for his lack of participation in\ncounseling. (GE 7) In a letter of February 1992 to his probation officer, Applicant\nattributed his counseling absences to poor finances. He expressed a willingness to\ncontinue his counseling when he found work, but could provide no date certain.  (GE 7)\nHis letter did not deter his probation officer from asking the supervising court to consider\nordering Applicant to spend 180 days in protective custody. (see GE 7).  In a series of\nminute orders in March and August 1992, Applicant was ordered to complete 300 hours\nof community service and was credited by the court with doing so. (GE 7).  By its minute\norder of March 26, 1992, the supervising court continued Applicant\u2019s probation on the\nsame terms and conditions and credited him with being in probation compliance. (GE 7)  \nIn March 1993, police were called to Applicant\u2019s motor home to investigate a\nneighbor\u2019s report of a child\u2019s screams in the home. (see GE 7)  The investigating officer\nfirst interviewed Applicant\u2019s youngest daughter (M).  Accounts of the officer\u2019s interview in\nthe investigation report reveal that M told the officer that Applicant placed her in the\ncorner and spanked her real hard, \u201ca whole bunch of times.\u201d (GE 7) M related that\nApplicant then placed her on the bed and spanked her again. Once he finished his\ninterview with M, the officer proceeded to interview Applicant in the front yard of the\nlocation. Asked what happened, Applicant told the officer he spanked her for \u201clying\u201d to\nhim. (GE 7). He told the officer M was wearing sweat pants at the time and any audible\nyelling from his motor-home was likely his own resulting from a slip and fall in the motor\nhome. (GE7) He then commented to the officer that he was on probation for physical\nchild abuse.\nAfter leaving Applicant, the investigating officer interviewed the informant who\nrequested to remain anonymous. This informant described the yelling as continuous over\na ten-minute period, and generally indicative of a very, very angry man. (GE 7). The\ninvestigating officer then spoke with Applicant\u2019s mother and photographed M\u2019s injuries\nwith the assistance of Applicant\u2019s mother. M\u2019s injuries included red bruise marks on her\nupper buttocks at the base of her spine.\nWhen the investigating officer confronted Applicant with his observations of M,\nApplicant admitted to lying to the officer in his first interview and attributed his initial false\naccounting of the incident with M to his fears of having his probation revoked and his\nbeing returned to jail. (GE 7) Based on his observations of M, the investigating officer\n\n6\nthen examined Applicant\u2019s other daughter (C) for signs of hard spanking. While he did\nsee some bruise marks on C\u2019s buttocks area, he could not determine the extremity of the\nmarks. Although this investigating officer was able to form an opinion that Applicant had\nviolated his probation conditions with his actions toward M, he noted Applicant\u2019s eventual\ncooperation and decided not to take Applicant into custody at the time, pending further\ninvestigation and a determination of Applicant\u2019s probation conditions. (GE 7)\nOnce the county\u2019s investigation of Applicant\u2019s actions against M in March 1993\nwas completed, a warrant was issued for Applicant\u2019s arrest for violation of probation\nassociated with Applicant\u2019s 1990 child abuse conviction. (GE 7) In the state\u2019s probation\nrevocation application, Applicant\u2019s probation officer described Applicant as a \u201cspeed\nuser, and he abuses his children . . .\u201d (GE 7) His probation officer recommended\nrevocation of Applicant\u2019s probation. In an initial court hearing in April 1993, the court\ngranted the State\u2019s preliminary motion to revoke Applicant\u2019s probation, pending the\noutcome of an evidentiary hearing on the motion. (GE 7). But at the scheduled\nevidentiary hearing (two weeks later) on the probation violation charges, the presiding\ncourt listened to the testimony of Applicant and the investigating police officers and found\nno probation violation. (GE 7) The court added conditions to Applicant\u2019s probation\nconditions: no use of corporal punishment on any child and  continued counseling.           \n                                                                            \nOn March 2, 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with corporal injury to his\nspouse and simple battery. He pled no contest to both counts and was found guilty of\nboth counts. (GE 6) According to Applicant\u2019s account, he and W2 were experiencing\nfamily issues at the time of his arrest. She had lost her job; their two daughters were\nstealing from Applicant; and her son (from another marriage) had threatened Applicant\nphysically. On the evening of his arrest, Applicant, W2, and C were at their home, and\nApplicant had consumed a half bottle of Tequila (or fifth) that evening. (GE 3)  Applicant\nbecame intoxicated from his drinking and blacked out. He recalled going to sleep and\nthen awaking, after which he screamed and yelled at W2 over something trivial. He\nrecalled grabbing W2 and throwing her to the floor, but nothing more.  He claims that W2\nand C have not been willing to tell him any more about his action that evening, and he\nhas no further details of his own to add of the evening\u2019s events. (GE 3) He claimed he\nwas confused about the evening\u2019s events and was told only by arresting sheriffs\u2019\ndeputies that he was being arrested for domestic violence. (GE 3)\nSheriff\u2019s deputies who took a distress call from C concerning the events of March\n2, investigated the incident. Upon arriving at Applicant\u2019s home, the investigating officer\nwas told by W2 that she and Applicant were involved in an argument over a small matter\nwhen Applicant grabbed her by her upper arm and threw her to the ground. (GE 6)\nApplicant (according to W2) then grabbed her by the neck with his left hand and choked\nher.  She managed to kick him in the groin/stomach area and gain her release from his\nclutches. After releasing her, he yelled at her: \u201cIf you don\u2019t give me my (expletive) lighter,\nI will (expletive) kill you.\u201d (GE 6) At this point, Applicant\u2019s daughter C tried to intervene on\nher mother\u2019s behalf, and was pushed backwards (uninjured by the push).  Fearing for C\u2019s\nand her own safety, W2 picked up a baseball bat and yelled at Applicant to leave the\nroom. Applicant complied until police arrived. Asked for her account of the events of\n\n7\nMarch 2 by the investigating officer, C corroborated her mother\u2019s account. (GE 6) In\naddition to obtaining statements from the principals present at the March 2 incident, the\ninvestigating officer examined W2 for body marks and noted dry blood on W2's right\ntemple area, and redness on her throat. \nBased on the investigation of the March 2 events, the investigating officer arrested\nApplicant for injury to W2 and battery (simple), took him into custody, and transported\nhim to a local police station for booking. (GE 6) A misdemeanor complaint was filed in\nthe \nlocal \nsuperior \ncourt, \ncharging \nApplicant \nwith \ncorporal \ninjury \nto \na\nspouse/cohabitant/child\u2019s parent and battery: simple. (GE 6) Applicant plead no contest\nto both counts and was found guilty of each count. The sentencing court placed him on\nprobation for 60 months; ordered him to serve 45 days in jail or perform 45 days of work\nfor a state program; required him to attend a domestic violence batters\u2019 program (VP);\nrequired him to attend 20 Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings; and fined him. (GE 6)\nPost-conviction rehabilitation efforts\nApplicant enrolled in a recognized violence prevention program (VP) in June 2006\nand documents his completion of the 52-week program in July 2007. (see GE 7 and AE\nB; Tr. 113) He also completed 20 meetings with a local AA chapter. (AE B; Tr. 114)\nApplicant documented his completion of 48 hours of community service, in lieu of serving\n45 days of jail time. (see AE B; Tr. 151-152)\nContemporaneous with his enrollment in VP\u2019s domestic violence program\nApplicant voluntarily admitted himself to an outpatient treatment program with K facility in\nMarch 2006. Medical records document Applicant\u2019s weekly participation in K facility\u2019s\nadult treatment plan between March 2006 and June 5, 2006. (AE B). K facility\u2019s\nconsultation report included an alcohol and drug history from Applicant. It reports the\nabsence of any prior diagnosis or treatment for a mental or emotional disorder or\nsubstance abuse problem.  In providing background information to K facility, Applicant\ndenied any family history of mental illness, but reported a positive family history of\nsubstance abuse with his siblings. He reported the absence of any parental physical and\nemotional support during his nurturing years. And he denied any prior hospitalizations.\nCiting logistical conflicts with his anger management classes, Applicant ceased\nattending his outpatient sessions with K facility in July 2006. (Tr. 137-138). In his\ninterview with an investigator of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in July\n2007, Applicant assured the investigator he could not historically recall any instances of\ntaking prescribed medications. Nor could he recollect any diagnosis of any kind of\ncondition. (compare GE 3 with AE B)\nSince the Fall of 2008, Applicant has participated in a spiritually-based 12-step\nrecovery program affiliated with his church. (see GE 3 and AE A; Tr. 141-143) The\nprogram\u2019s ministry leader, and Applicant\u2019s current sponsor, described his church\u2019s\ncelebrate recovery program as a Christ-centered, biblically-based 12-step recovery\nprogram for men and women \u201cdealing with all kinds of life\u2019s hurts, habits and hang-ups.\u201d\n\n8\n(AE A; Tr. 53). His ministry uses a 12-step program similar to the program used by AA\nchapters nationally. (AE A; Tr. 53)  Its stated purpose is to encourage fellowship and to\ncelebrate God\u2019s healing power as they work their way along the road to recovery.\n Both Applicant and his past co-leader of his ministry\u2019s alcohol recovery program\ncredit the program with helping Applicant to maintain his sobriety and account for and\ntake more responsibility for his own actions. (Tr.131-134, 143-145)  Like AA, his church\u2019s\n12-step program offers chips to celebrate sobriety milestones. The ministry\u2019s pastor\ncredits Applicant with completing all of the 12 steps in the program, and continuing to\nwork the same steps as a co-leader of his 12-step ministry with his church pastor and\nsponsor since September 2009. (see AE A; Tr. 54-55  \nApplicant provided no chips or other documentary evidence to corroborate his\nabstinence claims and clean arrest record since March 2006. Nonetheless, the\nassurances provided by Applicant and his pastor/sponsor that Applicant, with the aid of\nhis church\u2019s celebrate recovery ministry, has maintained his abstinence since March\n2006 are credible and accepted.  (see AE A; Tr. 50-57, 131-132) \nAfforded an opportunity to explore his obtaining an early release from his\nprobation condition (then due to expire in March 2011), Applicant successfully moved the\nsupervising court with continuing jurisdiction over Applicant\u2019s March 2006 conviction to\ngrant him early release from any continuing probation conditions. (see AE D). The court\u2019s\nOctober 2010 minute order confirmed the court\u2019s termination of Applicant\u2019s probation\nupon his motion to modify his probation. The state did not oppose Applicant\u2019s motion.\n(AE D)  \nApplicant\u2019s E-Qip and OPM interview omissions \nAsked to complete a security application (E-QIP) in March 2006, Applicant listed\nhis pending charges related to his March 2, 2006, spousal abuse offense. (see GE 1)\nHowever, he omitted his 1993 incident. This incident was potentially includable in the\npertinent information sections of the E-QiIP because it involved an underlying felony\nconviction.  Specifically, his 1993 incident covered the investigation of reported cruelty to\na child and warrant for his arrest for violation of probation ordered by the sentencing\ncourt in 1990. However, neither the charging revocation of probation motion nor the\nentered orders of the hearing court cited any governing penal authority for probation\nrevocation, and there is noting in the record to identify the governing standards in the\nevent Applicant\u2019s probation was revoked. \nFactually, it is not at all clear whether a probation revocation in the jurisdiction\nwhere the 1993 matter arose invoked a felony, or just a misdemeanor. If a violation of\nprobation is only a misdemeanor in Applicant\u2019s state, then Applicant\u2019s 1993 arrest would\nnot have required listing in his E-QIP. Uncertainty in classifying the criminal level of a\nprobation violation covering a felony conviction may best explain why Applicant\u2019s 1993\narrest was not alleged in the SOR.  Since the issuance of the SOR, there has been no\n\n9\nGovernment amendment request to add Applicant\u2019s 1993 arrest as an arrest that should\nhave been listed in Applicant\u2019s E-QIP. \nApplicant was twice interviewed by Government investigators concerning his\narrest history. In his July 2004 interview with an agent from the Defense Security Service\n(DSS), he covered his arrests in 1988 and 1990, but did not mention his receipt of an\nissued 1993 warrant for his arrest for probation violation. Applicant denied any intention\nto intentionally omit this arrest, but provided no detailed explanations. Without any\nestablished legal certainty that a probation violation related to a felony conviction itself\nconstitutes a felony, on legal requirement can be ascribed to Applicant to disclose the\n1993 warrant and motion. In his E-QIP.\nIn October 2007, an agent from OPM scheduled an interview with Applicant to\ndiscuss his March 2006 spousal abuse incident with W2. Asked why he did not list the\narrest in his March 2006 E-QIP, Applicant indicated that the incident \u201coccurred after he\nsubmitted his SF questionnaire.\u201d (GE 3) He proceeded to provide background\ninformation preceding the incident, and limited information about his recall of the incident\nitself. There are no indications in the summary of interview that the OPM agent asked\nApplicant about any other arrests, or that the arrest warranted full voluntary disclosure by\nApplicant.  Applicant volunteering that he has \u201ccommitted no other similar offenses\u201d other\nthan the ones he was convicted of 1989 and 1990 was not a misstatement, if the\nunderlying felony conviction did not set the legal parameters for determining the nature\nof any probation violation. (GE3) Applicant provided no other pertinent information about\nhis 1993 arrest. \nApplicant\u2019s explanations of his omissions of his 1993 arrest in both his 2004 and\n2007 interviews are not totally reconcilable with his past statements regarding the\nsubstantive charges.  His claim that his girlfriend falsely accused him of striking a child is\nnot entirely consistent with the police findings following an investigation into claims that\nApplicant spanked his girlfriend\u2019s son. Although the anonymous caller\u2019s identity is not\nclear from the police accounts of the 1993 incident, accounts of his spanking the child\nare fairly settled. What investigating officers could not agree on was the extent of the\ninjuries incurred by the child, and whether the evidence was sufficient to revoke\nApplicant\u2019s probation. \nMore persuasive are Applicant\u2019s confusion claims stemming from his\nmisunderstanding of the significance of the court\u2019s dismissal of the 1993 probation\nviolation charges.. Contextually, he claimed confusion over the E-QIP question in light of\nthe dismissal of the probation violation charges based on the developed evidence by\ninvestigating police. His stated reasons for not volunteering information about the 1993\nincident without any questions from interviewing agents are plausible and credible under\nall of the circumstances considered, and are accepted.  While he does not question the\npunishable nature of a probation violation (felony or misdemeanor), it is questionable\nwhether he had any duty to disclose his 1993 arrest to the interviewing OPM agent.\nOnly if a probation violation was legally defined as a felony itself would the arrest (older\nthan seven years) need to be disclosed at all by Applicant. \n\n10\n Considering all of the circumstances surrounding the statements provided by\nApplicant in his 2004 DSS interview and his 2007 OPM interview, inferences warrant that\nApplicant\u2019s interview omissions of his 1993 arrest were legally excusable.  In the event a\nprobation violation associated with an underlying felony conviction could be considered a\nfelony and subject to disclosure requirements, inferences warrant that Applicant\u2019s failure\nto disclose his 1993 arrest in either interview was inadvertent.   \nEndorsements and performance evaluations\nApplicant is highly regarded by his coworkers. His maintenance facility leads\ndescribe Applicant as trustworthy and dependable. They credit him with integrity and\nresponsibility. (see AE A)  His church pastor with considerable knowledge of his drinking\nand anger issues cites Applicant\u2019s marriage to W2 following his March 2006 incident as a\nstrong testament of his progress in overcoming the alcohol and anger problems that\ncontributed to so much of his arrest history. (AE A) Applicant\u2019s pastor credits Applicant\nwith being an active church member who is trustworthy and honorable.  \nMembers of Applicant\u2019s celebrate ministry are equally effusive in their praise of\nApplicant\u2019s positive efforts in overcoming alcohol and alcohol issues and consider\nApplicant an invaluable member of their Celebrate Recovery ministry. (AE A) They credit\nhim with demonstrated Christ-like qualities, honesty, openness, humility, and a unique\nwillingness and ability to lead others by serving. Both his pastor and local outreach\nminister recommend Applicant for a position of trust.\nPolicies\nThe AGs list guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the decision-\nmaking process covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that\ncould create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as\nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. These guidelines include \"[c]onditions that could raise a\nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (disqualifying conditions), if any, and many of\nthe \"[c]onditions that could mitigate security concerns.\u201d These guidelines must be\nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted,\ncontinued, or denied. The guidelines do not require administrative judges to place\nexclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the\nguidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is to be evaluated in the\ncontext of the whole person in accordance with AG \u00b6 2(c) \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a)\nof the revised AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent\nguidelines within the context of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed\nto examine a sufficient period of an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be\nmade about whether the applicant is an acceptable security risk. \n\n11\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following AG \u00b6 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy concerns are pertinent herein:\nCriminal Conduct\nThe Concern: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into\nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and\nregulations.  AG, \u00b6 30.\nAlcohol Consumption\nThe Concern: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the\nexercise of questionable judgment, or the failure to control impulses, and\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\nSee AG, \u00b6 21.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe \nConcern: \nConduct \ninvolving \nquestionable \njudgment,\nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \ndishonesty, \nor\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  AG, \u00b6 15.\nBurden of Proof\nUnder the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for\nsecurity clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do so is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest. Because the Directive requires administrative\njudges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record,\nthe ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in\nlarge part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all adversarial\nproceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and\n\n12\nlogical basis from the evidence of record. Conversely, the judge cannot draw factual\ninferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR; and (2) it must demonstrate that the\nfacts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or his security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.  Because Executive Order 10865 requires that all\nsecurity clearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, \u201csecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\nAnalysis\nApplicant presents as a conscientious maintenance facility technician with a\nconsiderable history of assorted arrests and convictions (several alcohol-related) over a\n26-year period and recurrent problems with alcohol before turning to a spiritually-inspired\nrecovery program. Principal security issues raised in this case center on Applicant\u2019s\nhistory of arrests for child and spousal abuse, his recurrent periods of alcohol abuse, and\nhis omitted accounts of a 1993 arrest in his DSS and OPM interviews that followed his\ncompletion of an E-QIP in March 2006.\nCriminal arrest issues\nApplicant\u2019s arrests and convictions fall into two principal categories: drugs and\nalcohol, driving on a suspended license, and burglary arrests in the 1984-1985 time\nframe, and a series of child abuse arrests (three in all) spaced between 1988 and 1993,\nand a more recent spousal abuse arrest and conviction in March 2006. All but his 1993\nprobation violation charges resulted in convictions and extensive probation conditions,\nand in one instance (associated with his 1990 child abuse conviction), jail time.\nApplicable disqualifying conditions under the criminal conduct guideline include\nDC \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d DC \u00b6 31(c), \u201callegation or\nadmission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged,\nformally prosecuted or convicted,\u201d and DC \u00b6 31(e), \u201cviolation of parole or probation, or\nfailure to complete a court-mandated rehabilitation program.\u201d To be sure, Applicant was\nnever fully prosecuted or convicted of any probation violations.  Nonetheless, e-mail\nexchanges between Applicant and his parole officer in 1991 and 1992, and arrest reports\n\n13\nassociated with Applicant\u2019s 1993 arrest warrant for a violation of probation, reflect prima\nfacie instances of probation violations. The cited records are enough to justify the\napplication of  DC \u00b6 31(e) to the facts of Applicant\u2019s situation.\nApplicant\u2019s arrest and conviction history covered over 20 years and included two\nserious child abuse incidents in 1988 and 1990 that resulted in jail time and lengthy\nprobation conditions. More recently, he was convicted of spousal abuse and placed on\nfive years of probation and required to participate in anger management classes.\nTogether, they reflect a recurrent pattern of criminal behavior over an extended period of\ntime.\nSince March 2006, Applicant has not been involved in any recurrent abuse\nincidents. Applicant attributes his demonstrated rehabilitation to the anger management\nclasses he completed in July 2007, the counseling he received from K facility in 2006,\nthe support he has had from W2, and the spiritual growth he has been able to achieve\nwith the support of his Celebrate Recovery ministry.  The growth and maturing that\nApplicant has displayed throughout his rehabilitative efforts are impressive. He has\navoided any incidents with law enforcement since his last reported incident of March\n2006, and shows renewed strength in his relationships with W2 and his daughters. His\nprobation conditions that were not due to expire until March 2011 have been terminated\nby the court. As matters stand, Applicant has no remaining probation conditions to\nsatisfy.\nWithout any evidence to challenge Applicant\u2019s steady rehabilitative progress he\nhas shown since his last arrest in March 2006, the criminal conduct concerns that are\nbased on his history of recurrent arrests between 1984 and 2006 are entitled to crediting\nof mitigation. Applicant may rely on MC \u00b6 32(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed since the\ncriminal behavior happened, or it happened under unusual circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s prior convictions are currently aged and are outweighed by\nhis substantial showing of good judgment and trust demonstrated with his civilian\nemployers, and family over the past four years. Applicant has also established himself to\nbe a responsible parent of his two daughters (since emancipated) and stepson.   \nIn the face of Applicant\u2019s persuasive showing of extenuating circumstances\nsurrounding his 2006 arrest, his responsible parenting efforts, and his impressive\nprofessional achievements with his civilian employer, his prior arrests and convictions\nare not enough to warrant continuing security concerns about his judgment, reliability,\nand trustworthiness. \n Based on his own rehabilitative efforts to date (which include anger management\nclasses, permanent changes in his family environment, and almost four years of\ndemonstrated responsibility and trust with his children and with his colleagues in the\nworkplace), the chances of any recurrent domestic actions like the ones that produced\nhis 2006 conviction are highly unlikely.  Applicant may take advantage of MC \u00b6 32(d) of\nthe criminal conduct guideline, \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including\n\n14\nbut not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive\ncommunity involvement.\u201d\nBoth from a consideration of the applicable guidelines, and from a whole-person\nperspective, Applicant demonstrates he  possesses the strength of overall character and\nrehabilitation to meet all of the minimum requirements under the criminal conduct\nguideline for continued eligibility to hold a security clearance. Applicant maintains the\nconfidence and trust of past and present leads in his maintenance facility familiar with his\nwork and behavior within and without the work place. And he has completed all of his\nprobation conditions and maintains the positive support of his church pastors.\nApplicant\u2019s many credits in his life should not be taken to minimize in any way the\nseriousness of his actions that resulted in his series of child abuse, spousal abuse, and\nother illegal actions over a 20-year period spanning 1984 and March 2006.  Based on\nthe confluence of corrective steps he has taken to date, he persuasively demonstrates\nthat he has learned important lessons from his unfortunate lapses in judgment and\nfamilial responsibilities and will work earnestly to avoid any recurrence. Taking into\naccount all of the facts and circumstances developed in the record, favorable\nconclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by subparagraphs 1.a\nthrough 1.c and 1.e through 1.i of the SOR.\nAlcohol issues\nApplicant\u2019s recurrent history of excessive drinking and his 2006 alcohol-related\narrest on spousal abuse charges raise important security concerns about his risk of\nrecurrent alcohol abuse. On the strength of the evidence presented, two disqualifying\nconditions (DC) of the AG for alcohol consumption (AG \u00b6 21) may be applied: DC \u00b6\n22(a), \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the\ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace or other incidents of\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent,\u201d and  DC \u00b6 22(c), \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the\npoint of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an\nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d  \nTrue, Applicant considers himself an alcoholic and attends a church-based 12-\nstep program.  Still, he has never been diagnosed for alcohol abuse or dependence.  As\na result, DC \u00b6 22(f), \u201crelapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and\ncompletion of an alcohol rehabilitation program is inapplicable to the facts of Applicant\u2019s\ncase.\nCognizant of his recurrent history of abusive drinking and the seriousness of his\nalcohol-related spousal abuse conviction in 2006, Applicant has come to recognize he is\nalcoholic and assures he will continue his 12-step Christ-based recovery program\ndesigned to keep him alcohol-free. Since his last and only documented alcohol-related\nincident in 2006, he has remained abstinent and is committed to avoiding alcohol in the\n\n15\nfuture. Applicant\u2019s assurances are highly credible based on the progress he has shown\nto date, and are  accepted.\nBased on the positive steps he has taken to address his problems with alcohol,\nsince his 2006 offense, Applicant may rely on one of the mitigating conditions of the\nalcohol guideline: MC \u00b6 22(a),\u201c so much time has passed, or the behavior was so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.\u201d  While four years of demonstrated good behavior is not a significant period of\nrecovery for an applicant who abused the substance recurrently over the previous 28\nyears, it is enough considering the quality of his recovery program and the time he has\ncommitted to sustained abstinence. \nTaking into account Applicant\u2019s very limited history of alcohol-related incidents\n(defined by his cited two alcohol-related incidents), his rehabilitation efforts with his\ncelebrate recovery ministry, and his strong work record, the applicable guidelines, and a\nwhole-person assessment, conclusions warrant that his overall efforts reflect sufficient\nevidence of sustained commitment to abstinence (over four years of sobriety) to ensure\nthat he is not at any risk of recurrent alcohol abuse.  \nConsidering the record as a whole, Applicant makes a convincing showing that he\nhas the strength and stability to avert any recurrent problems with judgment lapses\nrelated to alcohol. Applicant\u2019s mitigation efforts are enough to warrant safe predictions\nthat he is no longer at risk to judgment impairment associated with alcohol abuse.\nFavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by Guideline G of\nthe SOR. \nPersonal conduct concerns\nSecurity concerns over Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability and trustworthiness are\nraised under Guideline E as the result of his omissions of his 1993 probation violation\narrest in both his 2004 DSS interview and his later 2007 OPM interview. By omitting his\narrest warrant stemming from an investigation into a possible probation violation in 1993,\nquestions arise over whether Applicant failure to furnish materially important background\ninformation about his arrest history that was needed for the Government to properly\nprocess and evaluate his security clearance application.\nApplicant\u2019s omissions are attributable to some misunderstanding and uncertainty\nover the listing requirements of the issued arrest warrant in light of (a) leal questions over\nthe legal nature of a probation violation associated with an underlying felony conviction\nand (b) a subsequent favorable court finding on the underlying charges. Because of the\nraised uncertainty over the nature of a probation violation covering an underlying felony\n(misdemeanor or felony) and Applicant\u2019s accepted confusion over the meaning of the\npertinent E-QIP question in light of the court\u2019s ensuing finding in his favor, no\nconclusions of deliberate omission may attach to his failure to disclose the arrest in\neither of his two interviews. Accordingly, the falsification allegations are unproven.  \n\n16\nIn evaluating all of the circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s DSS and OPM\nomissions of his 1993 arrest, and his hearing testimony, his explanations are sufficient to\nenable him to convincingly refute or mitigate the deliberate falsification allegations.\nOverall, Applicant\u2019s explanations about his omissions and misrepresentations are\npersuasive enough to warrant conclusions that the falsification allegations relative to his\nomissions of his 1993 arrest in his DSS and OPM interviews are unsubstantiated. Taking\ninto account all of the evidence produced in this record, favorable conclusions warrant\nwith respect to the Guideline E allegations that Appellant knowingly and wilfully omitted\nhis 1993 arrest warrant in the DSS and OPM interviews he attended in 2004 and 2007,\nrespectively.  \nFormal Findings\n   \nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate\nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE J (CRIMINAL CONDUCT):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparas. 1.a -1.c, 1.e -1.i                      For Applicant\n:\nGUIDELINE G (ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION):   FOR APPLICANT\nSubparas. 2.a -2.c:\n           For Applicant\nGUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparas 3.a and 3.b:\nFor Applicant \n            \n       \nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance. \nClearance is granted.\n                                  \nRoger C.

On February 25, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On June 19, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Shari Dam denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal:  whether the Judge\u2019s findings are based on\nsubstantial evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision under Guideline\nF is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\n \n(1) Applicant contends that the Judge erred in finding that Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties\nwere due in part to \u201ca previous drinking problem.\u201d   In support of that contention, he argues that he\n1\ndoes not have \u201ca drinking problem,\u201d but instead has \u201c. . . a problem with drinking beer.  The problem\nwas, and is, medical.  I have peripheral neuropathy in both feet and beer exacerbates the problem.\u201d2\nThe Board\u2019s review of a Judge\u2019s findings is limited to determining if they are supported by\nsubstantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.32.1. \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607,\n620 (1966).\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s findings are based on\nsubstantial evidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or inferences that could be drawn\nfrom the record.  Applicant has not identified any harmful error likely to change the outcome of the\ncase.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern\nare sustainable.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21025 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2007).  \n(2) Applicant also contends that the favorable evidence in the record was sufficient, as a\nmatter of law, to overcome any security concerns presented by his financial difficulties.  Specifically,\nhe argues that his failure to pay off his outstanding debts was not due to \u201cprocrastination,\u201d because\nhe \u201c. . . has only reached the level where payment of outstanding debts was possible in the last five\n\nApplicant\u2019s Brief at 1.\n3\nThe Judge also found that several of the debts listed in SOR were duplicates.  The debts in paragraphs 1(a) and\n4\n1(b) were the same debts, as were the debts listed in paragraphs 1(f) and 1(m).\n3\nor six years,\u201d and during that time period he did pay off a substantial student loan.   He notes that\n3\nhe has had excellent job performance and that he has held a security clearance without incident for\n15 years.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious\nor contrary to law.\nThe Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under\nany of the Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-22325 at\n3-4 (App. Bd. July 30, 2004).  Security clearance determinations are not limited to consideration of\nwork performance or conduct during duty hours.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-08623 at 5 (App. Bd.\nJuly 29, 2005).  The federal government need not wait until an applicant actually mishandles or fails\nto properly handle or safeguard classified information before it can deny or revoke access to such\ninformation.  See Adams v. Laird, 420 F.2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969).  The absence of security\nviolations does not bar or preclude an adverse security clearance decision.  See ISCR Case No. 01-\n03357 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2005).\n \nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-05632 at 2 (App. Bd. May 13, 2008).\nA review of the record indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible\napplication of relevant conditions and factors.  She gave Applicant credit for debts that he had paid\nand found in his favor with respect to several of the factual allegations.   However, she reasonably\n4\nexplained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to\novercome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The\nfavorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep.\n4, 2007).  The Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for her\ndecision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)\n(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v.

On February 25, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).

In his November 2007 response to a set of Interrogatories \npertaining to financial delinquencies, he listed 21 debts and their outstanding balances. \n(GE 2 at 49). He attached a November 2007 credit bureau report (CBR) to the response \nand noted he \u201cwill be paying this off in the next few weeks\u201d next to a $283 utility debt. \n(Id. at 58).  On February 25, 2008, the SOR notified him of the specific debts that \ncreated a security concern. On May 12, 2008, (two days before the hearing in this \ncase), he entered into a debt repayment agreement for four debts, incorporating two \ndebts disclosed on his e-QIP and two listed in the Interrogatories.

The status \nof the 13 debts is as follows: \n \n \nApplicant paid four debts that total $7,866. He completed payment on \u00b6 1.h (his \nstudent loan for $7,189), through a garnishment that ended in June 2007. (AE D). On \nMay 27, 2008, he paid \u00b6 1. d (a $60 medical bill), \u00b6 1. e (a $283 utility bill), and \u00b6 1. k (a \n$334 department store debt). (AE E and F). \n \n  \n \nApplicant entered into a repayment agreement on May 12, 2008, which includes \nfour debts, totaling $12,718: \u00b6 1.b (a $5,567 credit card company debt); \u00b6 1.c (a $5,734 \nautomobile loan); \u00b6 1.j (a $217 loan); and \u00b6 1.n (a $1,200 loan). According to the plan, \nApplicant was required to make an initial payment of $212 on May 20, 2008.  \n \n \nFive debts remain unresolved: \u00b6 1.f is a department store debt for $2,665; \u00b6 1.g \nis a credit card debt for $5,984; \u00b6 1.i is a department store debt for $235; \u00b6 1.l is a \ngasoline credit card debt for $150; and \u00b6 1.o is a department store debt for $300. These \ndebts total $9,334. \n \n \nApplicant submitted a budget with the November 2007 Interrogatories that \nessentially remains accurate. His current net monthly income is $6,000 and includes his \nspouse\u2019s $600 salary. The family expenses are $5,366, including payments on his \nmortgage and car loan. With an increase in gas prices, he estimates he has between \n$150 and $500 remaining for discretionary items. (Tr. 69).   \n \n \nThroughout his testimony, Applicant acknowledged that he has procrastinated in \nresolving these debts. He admitted that the garnishment of his wages to repay his \nstudent loan was due to his procrastination. (Tr. 73). He also\u201d waited and waited\u201d before \ncalling the debt consolidation company at the last minute to set up the repayment plan \nfor the four debts. (Tr. 58).  At the conclusion of the hearing, Applicant expressed \nconcern over losing his job as a result of these security concerns. In reference to the six \nunresolved debts, he stated: \n \nOf the six debts that I have to \u2013 or the six entities I have to contact, there\u2019s \none that\u2019s enough where it could be added on to this agreement that I\u2019ve \nmade with this debt company, and the other six I can pay separately. \nThat\u2019s going to be done. All I can say is that I will get \u2013 take care of what \nwe have agreed to as quickly as possible and get the proof of that to you \nas quickly as possible in whatever form you\u2019d like and I only hope that \nyou\u2019ll let me have a couple of weeks or a week or so to do that, and I will \ntake care of it. [Sic] \n \n                                            \n1SOR \u00b6 1. a ($2,018) is a duplicate of \u00b6 1.b ($5,567); \u00b6 1.m ($173) is a duplicate of \u00b6 1.f ($2,665).  \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n \nPursuant to his request, the record remained open for two weeks to give him an \nopportunity to resolve or submit additional information on the six debts that remain \nunresolved. He subsequently produced evidence that he paid the $263 utility bill, a $60 \nmedical bill, and one of the six debts that owed to a department store (for $334) and \ndisclosed on his e-QIP. He did not address the other outstanding five debts. \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n\n \n \n \n \n5\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \npotentially applicable in this case. Under AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201can inability or unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.  Similarly, under AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations\u201d may raise security concerns. Applicant began \naccumulating a significant amount of delinquent debt seven or eight years ago that he \ndid not intend to pay until recently. The evidence is sufficient to raise these \ndisqualifications. \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those disqualifications, \nthe burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition. \nAG \u00b6 20 includes six conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \nfinancial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n\n \n \n \n \n6\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \nApplicant=s financial worries arose seven to eight years ago and continue into \n2008 because he did not intend to resolve many of them. Because the problems have \nbeen ongoing, are not isolated, and resulted from a decision not to address them, his \njudgment and reliability are called into question. Hence, AG \u00b6 20(a) cannot apply.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts accumulated as a result of personal problems, his daughter\u2019s \nmedical problems, and insufficient income.  Some of those circumstances were outside \nof his control. As he did not present evidence indicating that he attempted to manage \nhis debts over the years, I find AG \u00b6 20(b) has partial application.  \n \n Applicant produced evidence that he paid $7,866 of his debt. He documented \nthe execution of a recent repayment plan for $12,718 of his outstanding debts, but \nprovided no evidence that he made any payment. He did not fully address $9,334 of the \noutstanding debts, which he indicated he intended to do at the end of his testimony. He \ndid not provide evidence that he obtained credit counseling. Hence, I conclude AG \u00b6 \n20(c) and AG \u00b6 20(d) has only partial application. They apply fully to the debts that he \npaid. They have limited application to those that he placed on a repayment plan, but not \nfull application because he did not produce evidence of having made any payment on it.  \nConsequently, he did not adequately demonstrate that his debts are under control or \nthat he made a good-faith effort to address them. These two AGs do not have any \napplication to the five unresolved debts. \n \nThere is no evidence to support the application of AG \u00b6 20(e) and AG \u00b6 20(f).   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant is a 50-year-old married \nman. He is intelligent and educated. He has worked for his current employer since 1994 \nand held a security clearance during that time. About seven to eight years ago, he \nbegan accumulating delinquent debts as a result of various circumstances. In February \n2006, he disclosed eight of those debts to the Government. In November 2007, the \nGovernment inquired further into his delinquencies. In his response to that inquiry, he \nlisted additional debts and indicated that he intended to let some of them become \nlegally unenforceable and not make payments. He also noted he was going to pay a \npast due utility bill of $283 within a couple weeks (which he did not do). At the time, he \nfelt that he did not have an obligation or responsibility to pay the numerous debts that \nhe incurred.    \n \nAfter receiving the SOR in February 2008, Applicant clearly realized his \ndelinquencies were creating potential employment problems. Two days before the \nhearing, he entered into a repayment plan with a company to begin resolving his debts, \nbut did not make any initial down payment on it. While testifying, he further expressed \nhis employment concerns and requested time to resolve six unresolved debts. The \nrecord was held open for two weeks to give him time to provide further documentation in \nsupport of his case.  Although he subsequently presented evidence of payment for three \ndebts, including the previously mentioned utility bill, a small medical bill, and a \ndepartment store charge, he did not resolve five debts, totaling $9,334, as he said he \nwould. His history of procrastination and refusal to pay his bills, demonstrate a \nconsistent pattern of poor judgment and a lack of reliability. Based on that history, I am \nconcerned that he will not comply with his repayment plan or resolve the debts that \nremain outstanding. Despite a budget that will accommodate a repayment plan, I \nbelieve similar problems may recur in the future until he commits to establishing a solid \nfinancial track and gains insight into the reasons for his procrastination.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of the above \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under \nfinancial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n\n \n \n \n \n8\n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n (Same as 1.b) \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n Against Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n Against Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d  \n For Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n For Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n Against Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n Against Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n For Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n Against Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n Against Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n For Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n Against Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n (Same as 1.f) \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n Against Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n Against Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n For Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly not consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

On December 20, 2007, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn January 9, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on January \n31, 2008. The case was assigned to another administrative judge on February 1, 2008 \nand transferred to me on July 9, 2008. In January 2008, it was discovered that Applicant \nwas working in Iraq. He did not return to the U.S. on leave until November 2008. On \nOctober 21, 2008, a Notice of Hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for \nNovember 18, 2008. The case was heard on that date. The Government offered five \nJanuary 8, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nexhibits which were admitted as Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 5 without objection. \nApplicant testified and offered five exhibits which were admitted as Applicant Exhibits \n(AE) A \u2013 E without objection. The record was held open until December 19, 2008, to \nallow Applicant to submit additional documents. No additional documents were \nsubmitted. The transcript was received on December 4, 2008.

He was unemployed \nfor six months after separating from the U.S. Army in 1995. (Tr at 64.) In 1998, his \nemployer laid him off and he was unemployed for six months. (Tr at 57, 64-65.) From \nMarch 2006 to October 2006, he was unemployed for six months after being injured by \nthe spider bite in Iraq. He has a pending workmen\u2019s compensation claim with the \ncompany. (Tr at 35.) His periods of unemployment contributed to his financial problems \nbut he also admits some of his financial problems were due to mismanagement. (Tr at \n56; Gov 1, Additional Comments section.) \n \nIn 1995, Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy. He claims that he completed \nthe wage earner plan in 1998. (Tr at 38.) He claims the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, \nand 1.i were included in the bankruptcy. Applicant testified that he would obtain a copy \nof his bankruptcy and submit it post-hearing. (Tr at 40-41, 50.) No documents were \nsubmitted after the hearing. He also claimed the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.i \nwere the responsibility of his first ex-wife, who is now deceased. He provided a copy of \nthe automobile title pertaining to the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i indicating no liens on the \nautomobile. He has provided sufficient evidence to indicate these debts belonged to his \nfirst ex-wife. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.i are found for Applicant. (TR at 17, 38-40; AE A; Answer \nto SOR.) \n \nApplicant claims the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, and 1.b are medical accounts \nincurred by his current wife prior to their marriage. (Tr at 29-31.) SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are \nfound for Applicant. \n \nHe is waiting for a settlement offer related to the $4,629 medical debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.c.  In October 2002, he injured his ankle and had no medical insurance. The \ncompany was contacted in November 2007 to inquire about a settlement. His wife \nallegedly made a couple of phone calls since that time about a potential settlement. \nApplicant has not heard anything about a possible settlement. He has not made any \npayments towards the account because he is waiting for a settlement offer. (Tr at 32-\n33.)  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant admits that he owes the $1,072 medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. He \nhas made no contact with the creditor. (Tr at 33.)  \n \nApplicant disputes the $3,476 credit card account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f. He \nclaims that it was a company credit card and a previous employer is responsible for the \naccount. He is trying to contact the previous employer in order to get the account \nremoved from his credit report. The last time he contacted them was in early 2008. (Tr \nat 42-25.) \n \nThe $12,718 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g was a truck loan. Applicant could not \nmake the truck payments after he was laid off. He arranged to have a friend take over \nthe truck payments. His friend did not make the truck payments and the truck was \nrepossessed. The loan was in Applicant\u2019s name. He is trying to locate the company  \ncollecting on the debt. (Tr at 46-48.) \n \nThe $28,221 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h was an automobile loan. The car was \nrepossessed in 2004. Applicant is not sure who is currently collecting on the debt.   \n \nApplicant is currently waiting for a settlement offer related to the $3,770 amount \nowed on an apartment lease (SOR \u00b6 1.j). He has made no payments on the debt. He \nand his wife moved out of the apartment before their lease was up after his wife slipped \non the stairs while pregnant. They had complained to the landlord several times about \nproblems with the entry way but the landlord did not correct the problem. (Tr at 50.) \n \nApplicant denies the $253 telephone account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k.  He has no \nknowledge of the account. (Tr at 52; Answer to SOR.)  \n \nApplicant claims the $484 telephone debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l and the $723 \nutility account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m was opened by his second ex-wife. He admits that \nthe accounts were joint accounts and accepted responsibility for the accounts at \nhearing. (Tr at 53-54.) No payments have been made towards either account.  \n \nApplicant claims the $621 satellite television account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.n is paid \nbut provided no receipts at the close of the record. (Tr at 55; Answer to SOR.) \n \nApplicant denies the $496 Direct TV account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.o. He claims he \nnever had a Direct TV account. (Tr at 55.) \n \nIn late 2006/early 2007, Applicant contracted a law firm to dispute several of the \naccounts listed on his credit reports, including SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.o. He contacted them \nfour days prior to the hearing but has not heard anything about the status of the firm\u2019s \nprogress. (Tr at 52, 59.) He provided no documentation after the hearing pertaining to \nhis agreement with the law firm. \n \nApplicant is taking an online financial credit counseling course. He intends to \ntake a money management class when he returns to Iraq. (Tr at 60.) He recently \n\n \n5 \n \n \nconsulted consumer credit counseling. He intends to allocate $1,500 out of his \npaycheck towards his delinquent accounts. He claims he was too busy to resolve his \nfinancial situation while in Iraq. (Tr at 66-67; AE D.) No documentation was provided to \nindicate that an agreement has been created or when it will take effect.  \n \nApplicant and his wife were concerned about a letter they received which they \nbelieve was an attempt to steal his identity. It was addressed to a bank located in a \ncountry that is a US territory.  The letter asked that his credit rating be reconsidered and \nhas his social security number on the account. Neither Applicant or his wife mailed the \nletter. It was returned to their address because there was no such address for the bank. \nThey took actions to monitor their credit reports and it appears no unauthorized \naccounts had been opened. (Tr at 24; AE E.)    \n \nIn response to interrogatories, dated October 22, 2007, Applicant completed a \npersonal financial statement. His net monthly take home pay was $7,000. He listed \napproximately $4,283 in monthly expenses. He has approximately $2,717 in \ndiscretionary income left over each month after expenses. (Gov 2.) At hearing, \nApplicant testified these numbers are no longer accurate. He was given the option to  \nprovide an updated statement with his post-hearing submissions. No updated budget \nwas provided. His wife is a full-time student and does not work. (Tr at 61-62, 70.)    \n \nApplicant submitted numerous letters of recommendation commending his \nservice while working in Iraq and his overall character. (AE B at 1-7.)      \n  \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); FC DC &19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case.  Applicant has accumulated a significant \namount of delinquent debt since 2000. Previous financial problems resulted in a 1995 \nChapter 13 bankruptcy filing. The SOR alleges 15 debts, an approximate total balance \nof $63,739.   \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \n\u00b6E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. September 22, 2005)).  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. While \nApplicant states he retained a law firm to assist him in removing disputed debts off his \ncredit report in late 2006/early 2007, he provided no indication of the law firm\u2019s \nprogress. The majority of the accounts remain unresolved.  While he has made sporadic \nattempts to resolve his financial situation, he has not established a plan to resolve his \ndebts.  \n   \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies, in part. Applicant had several \nperiods of unemployment which contributed to his financial problems. However, he has \nbeen continuously employed in Iraq since October 2006, earning enough income to be \nable to begin to resolve his financial situation. At the close of the record, no proof was \nprovided that any of the delinquent accounts which were Applicant\u2019s responsibility were \nresolved.  I cannot conclude Applicant has acted responsibly under the circumstances.    \n \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. When he returned from Iraq on leave, Applicant consulted \nconsumer credit counseling. He intends to allocate $1,500 out of his paycheck to pay \ntowards his delinquent debts. He provided no proof at the close of the record that this \naction was completed. Even if it were completed, it is too soon to conclude Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial situation has stabilized due to his history of financial irresponsibility and no \nproof that any payments have been made towards his delinquent accounts. Given the \nextent of the debt it will take some time for the delinquent debts to be resolved.  \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) does not apply. Applicant presented sufficient \nevidence that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.e, and 1.i were not his \nresponsibility. Aside from these debts, approximately $50,410 of unresolved delinquent \ndebt remains. Applicant testified that he is beginning to resolve his delinquent accounts. \nThe record was held open to allow him to submit documentation to corroborate his \nefforts. Nothing was submitted. I cannot conclude Applicant initiated a good-faith effort \nto resolve his delinquent accounts based on a lack of documentation.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \nFC MC \u00b620(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of \nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the \nissue) applies with respect SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.e, and 1.i. Applicant provided sufficient \ndocumentary evidence to support that these debts were not his responsibility.  He did \nnot provide sufficient evidence to support his disputes with the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.f, 1.k, 1.l. 1.m, and 1.o.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered the favorable \ncomments of Applicant\u2019s friends and co-workers. I considered Applicant\u2019s periods of \nunemployment. However, Applicant\u2019s financial situation has been relatively stable since \nOctober 2006. Although Applicant intends to pay off his delinquent accounts, he \nprovided insufficient evidence to establish that he has taken action to resolve his \ndelinquent accounts. A promise to pay in the future does not mitigate the security \nconcerns raised based on Applicant\u2019s past financial history. Applicant has not mitigated \nthe security concerns raised under financial considerations.  \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

DeLaney, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted a Security Clearance Application, EPSQ version, on\nFebruary 3, 2006. On February 14, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant  detailing security concerns\nunder Guideline J, Guideline G, and Guideline E as the bases for its decision to deny\nhis request for a security clearance. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 4, 2008, and requested a\ndecision without a hearing. On March 17, 2008, the government submitted a File of\nRelevant Material (FORM) consisting of six exhibits (Items 1-6). DOHA forwarded a\ncopy of the FORM to Applicant and instructed him to respond within 30 days of receipt.\nJune 17, 2008\n\nContrary to Department Counsel\u2019s assertion in the FORM, Applicant did not admit SOR \u00b6 1.d. The answer\n1\nof record (Item 4) does not include a response to that allegation.\n2\nApplicant submitted no response by the April 23, 2008, deadline. On May 27, 2008, the\ncase was assigned to me to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Based upon a review of\nthe government\u2019s FORM, including Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR allegations (Item 4),\neligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline J, criminal conduct, and under Guideline G,\nalcohol consumption, that Applicant committed three drunk driving offenses, in about\nJanuary 2006 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 2.a), December 1997 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 2.a), and March 1996\n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 2.a). Under Guideline J, Applicant was also alleged to have been issued a\ncitation for open container in 1993 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Under Guideline G, Applicant was also\nalleged to have consumed alcohol to excess and to intoxication from approximately\n1999 to at least January 2006 (SOR \u00b6 2.b). DOHA alleged under Guideline E, personal\nconduct, that Applicant falsified a February 2006 EPSQ by not disclosing his December\n1997 DWI (SOR \u00b6 3.a) or his March 1996 DWI (SOR \u00b6 3.b) in response to question 24\nconcerning whether he had ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s)\nrelated to alcohol or drugs. Applicant admitted the drunk driving offenses and the\nconsumption of alcohol to intoxication. He denied any falsification of his security\nclearance application, averring that he understood the ESPQ inquiry covered the last\nseven years of his history. Applicant did not respond to the alleged open container\nviolation in SOR \u00b6 1.d.  After reviewing the available evidence, I make the following\n1\nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is a 33-year-old electronics technician, who has worked for his present\nemployer since January 2005 (Item 5). He seeks a security clearance for his duties. The\navailable record does not reflect that he has held a clearance.\nApplicant drank during his late teens episodically when out with friends. In 1993,\nwhen he was 19, he and his friends were drinking outside an apartment. Someone\ncalled the police, and after his identification was checked, Applicant believes he, along\nwith others, was issued a citation for open container. To the best of his recollection, he\npaid a fine (Item 6).\nAfter Applicant turned 21, his consumption of alcohol increased. He consumed\nas much as six to nine beers on occasion in social settings (at parties, in bars, friends\u2019\nhomes, other social situations), but did not drink on a daily basis (Item 6). His alcohol\nconsumption led to his arrest three times for drunk driving between 1996 and 2006.\nIn mid-March 1996, Applicant drank four or five beers plus three or four shots of\nliquor at a local bar when out with a female friend. While taking her home, he was\nstopped for weaving and speeding. He failed field sobriety and alcohol breath tests and\n\nDOHA alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a that Applicant was charged was also charged with negligent driving and driving\n2\nwhile impaired with alcohol.  W hen interviewed about the offense in July 2006 Applicant told the investigator\nthat he was arrested for \u201cDriving Under the Influence of Alcohol\u201d and for reckless driving. The government\npresented no police or court records showing a second alcohol-related charge, although Applicant did not\ndeny the allegation.\n3\nwas arrested for driving under the influence (DUI). About three months later, he pleaded\nguilty and was given probation before judgment. The charge was to be dismissed on the\nfulfillment of certain conditions, including that he abstain from alcohol for 18 months,\npay a $500 fine, and attend an eight-week alcohol education program. His license was\nrestricted for three months with driving privileges limited to work and school. Applicant\nreports he complied with the terms, although there is evidence to the contrary in that he\ntold a government investigator in July 2006 that he had abstained from alcohol for only\ntwo to three months after his arrest (Item 6).\nApplicant was arrested again for DUI in early December 1997. After drinking one\nbeer at a happy hour with some coworkers,  Applicant accompanied some of them to a\nbar. Over about five hours time, he drank six or seven more beers and three shots of\nliquor. While driving a companion back to his vehicle, Applicant was pulled over by\ncounty police for speeding. Applicant realized at the time that he shouldn\u2019t have driven\nbut he was tired and wanted to go home. He failed field sobriety and breath tests (his\nblood alcohol level was about .18%) and he was arrested for DUI. In March 1998,\nApplicant was placed on two years probation, required to attend 26 weeks of outpatient\ngroup counseling and two weeks of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings, and\nassessed $500 court costs plus program fees. During a separate administrative\nadjudication by the motor vehicle department, Applicant was ordered to have an\n\u201cinterlock system\u201d installed on his vehicle for six months to prevent his car from starting\nif he had alcohol on his breath (Item 6).\nApplicant did not drink alcohol for about six months after his DUI, but resumed\ndrinking thereafter two to three beers per day on the weekends. In mid-January 2006,\nApplicant consumed a couple of beers at a happy hour with coworkers. He then\naccompanied a few of them to a bar where he drank seven to eight more beers and a\ncouple of \u201cJello shooters.\u201d He knew he wasn\u2019t sober, but elected to drive anyway, and\nhe was pulled over for swerving. Applicant was administered field sobriety tests that he\ncould not fully complete. On the advice of the lawyer who had represented him on an\nearlier DUI charge, Applicant refused to submit to a breathalyzer, and he was arrested\nfor level B DUI and negligent driving (Item 5, Item 6).  \n2\nOn February 3, 2006, Applicant completed an EPSQ on which he responded\n\u201cYES\u201d to questions 23 [\u201cAre there currently any charges pending against you for any\ncriminal offense?\u201d] and 24 [\u201cHave you ever been charged with or convicted of any\noffense(s) related to alcohol or drugs\u201d]. Applicant disclosed in response to both\nquestions 23 and 24 that he had been arrested for DWI in January 2006 and was\nwaiting for a court date. Applicant did not report his 1996 and 1997 DUI offenses in\nanswer to question 24 (Item 4). At an administrative proceeding before the motor\n\n4\nvehicle administration in April 2006, Applicant was ordered to have the interlock device\ninstalled on his vehicle for two years (Item 6).\nOn July 25, 2006, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the\nDepartment of Defense about his alcohol use and police record. He indicated that he\nhad a court date in October 2006 for his latest offense and had an interlock device\ninstalled in his vehicle. Applicant expressed his belief that he could have a problem with\nalcohol and could use some counseling, but that he mainly considered himself a social\ndrinker with bad luck. As for his current alcohol consumption, Applicant averred he was\ngoing out with his brother every other weekend to friends\u2019 homes where he consumed\nabout three beers over a five-hour time span. Applicant indicated that he had completed\na security clearance application in 2004. He told the investigator that he had listed only\nthe 1998 [sic] offense because he thought he only had to go back seven years.\nApplicant added that he would never again drive after drinking because he did not want\nto hurt anyone or lose his job (Item 6).\nOn the advice of his lawyer, Applicant began counseling in a 26-week outpatient\nprogram in August 2006 (Item 6). In about December 2006, Applicant appeared in court\nfor the January 2006 DUI. He was sentenced to serve three days in detention, three\nmonths house arrest, and three years probation, to complete his outpatient counseling\nprogram, to pay $350 court costs plus the costs of counseling, home detention,\nprobation, and the interlock system. Applicant completed his outpatient counseling in\nFebruary 2007. During his treatment program, he submitted to 18 breathalyser tests that\nwere all negative (Item 6).\nOn July 24, 2007, Applicant was reinterviewed by a government investigator\nabout his alcohol-related arrests, counseling, and consumption levels. Applicant\nindicated that his January 2006 DUI led him to realize he had a problem with alcohol.\nHe denied any drinking to intoxication since January 2006, and claimed he last\nconsumed alcohol during the Christmas holiday in 2006 when had only two beers. He\nindicated he might have one or two beers during the holidays in the future, but he did\nnot intend to drink and drive (Item 6).\nOn December 5, 2007, Applicant was notified by the state\u2019s drinking and driving\nmonitor program that he qualified for \u201cstandard low.\u201d His case was considered active but\nhe would no longer have to report in, although he would have to pay all monthly fees 30\ndays before the expiration of his probation case (Item 6).\nIn December 2007, DOHA asked Applicant to complete interrogatories inquiring\ninto his alcohol consumption, treatment programs, and any changes in his personal or\nprofessional situation indicative of a lifestyle free of alcohol abuse. Applicant responded\nthat he was not currently drinking and that he had last consumed alcohol on \u201cNew\nYear\u2019s Eve 2006. Beer only, approx. 6 cans.\u201d He denied any participation in any\nrecognized alcohol support group such as Alcoholics Anonymous. He provided a letter\nfrom the DWI monitor program declaring him eligible for \u201cstandard low\u201d and showing his\ncompliance with his probation. Applicant did not provide requested records of the\n\n5\nprogram he participated in after his second DUI, but attested that he would have been in\nviolation had he failed to complete it. As for lifestyle changes, Applicant averred that he\nhas avoided \u201cpast unhealthy relationships, such as \u2018drinking friends,\u2019\u201d is in compliance\nwith his probation, and has recently been informed of his promotion at work (Item 6).\nDOHA also provided Applicant with copies of the investigators\u2019 reports of his interviews\nin July 2006 and July 2007. Applicant confirmed they accurately reflected the\ninformation he had provided (Item 6).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\n\n6\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for Guideline J, criminal conduct, is set out in AG \u00b6 30:\n\u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d When interviewed by an authorized\ninvestigator for the Department of Defense, Applicant indicated that he recalled\nreceiving a citation for open container in 1993. It cannot be determined from the\navailable record whether he violated a local ordinance or a state criminal law. However,\nApplicant\u2019s three DUI offenses implicate AG \u00b6 31(a) (\u2018a single serious crime or multiple\nlesser offenses\u201d) and AG \u00b6 31(c) (\u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct,\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or\nconvicted\u201d).\nFor the January 2006 offense, he was sentenced later that year to three days in\na county detention center, three months house arrest, and three years probation. In\nabout December 2007, he was placed on \u201cstandard low status.\u201d This change to\nunsupervised probation implies he has been in compliance, but he was also informed\nthat should he be newly charged with a criminal offense, he would be required to\ncontact the DWI monitor immediately for reporting instructions. His case remains active\nand he has probation fees to pay as the DWI monitor indicated in her letter of December\n2007 that \u201call monthly fees will have to be paid 30 days prior to expiration of [his]\nprobation case.\u201d AG \u00b6 31(d) (\u201cindividual is currently on parole or probation\u201d) also\napplies.\nAs for the potential mitigating conditions, the recency of his January 2006 DUI\nand the similarity in circumstances to his second DUI preclude me from favorably\nconsidering AG \u00b6 32(a) (\u201c\u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment\u201d). Inasmuch as Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct is all alcohol-related, his\ncompletion of outpatient group counseling in February 2007 is relevant to determining\nwhether he is successfully rehabilitated under AG \u00b6 32(d) (\u201cthere is successful\nrehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of\ncriminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good\nemployment record, or constructive community involvement\u201d), as well as of the\n\nIn July 2006, Applicant told an investigator that his blood alcohol level was .18% on his arrest for DUI in\n3\nDecember 1997. One year later, he told an investigator that his blood alcohol content was .18% on the\noccasion of his March 1996 arrest,  and that he was unable to recall the amount consumed before his second\narrest for DUI.\n7\nGuideline G concerns, infra. He started the program before his court appearance for his\nlatest DUI. Although the program cannot be considered completely voluntary since he\nwas required to complete it as part of his sentence, he took 18 breath tests that were all\nnegative. He alluded in his response to interrogatories in December 2007 that he had\nbeen informed of a recent promotion at work.  Despite these indicia of reform, it would\nbe premature to conclude he is successfully rehabilitated. His latest DUI occurred about\nnine years after his second DUI and following his completion of alcohol education and\noutpatient counseling programs. He denies any intent to drive after drinking in the\nfuture, and there is no evidence that he has driven after consuming alcohol since his\nlast DUI. Yet he also has an interlock system on his vehicle which prevents it from\nstarting if alcohol is detected on his breath. A truer test of reform is whether he will\nabide by his stated intention to not drink and drive after that device has been removed\nfrom his vehicle. Given the persistent Guideline G concerns, infra, a future alcohol-\nrelated criminal incident cannot be ruled out.\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for alcohol consumption is set out\nin AG & 21: \u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and untrustworthiness.\u201d Applicant first consumed alcohol at age 14\n(Item 6), but it was not until he was in his late teens that he began drinking when out\nwith friends. He told a government investigator in July 2006 that he consumed\nanywhere from six to eight beers during a night out with friends starting when he was 17\nor 18. A year later, he told an investigator that he began experimenting with alcohol at\naround age 19 with friends, and that his consumption increased after he turned 21. The\nrecord before me for review contains little detail about his consumption in terms of\nfrequency or quantity. Applicant does not deny, however, and his DUI convictions\nconfirm, that he abused alcohol on repeated occasions, leading to a relatively recent\narrest in January 2006. His three drunk driving offenses raise security concerns under\nAG \u00b6 22(a) (\u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the\ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent\u201d). The record supports limited application of AG \u00b6 22(c) (\u201chabitual or\nbinge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether\nthe individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent\u201d). Applicant had a\nblood alcohol level of .18% on one or more occasions,  and he drank in abusive quantity\n3\nof at least eight beers before his latest DUI. The record does not otherwise indicate\ndrinking to binge levels.\n\n8\nAvailable information suggests he may also have failed to follow a court order\nconcerning abstinence (see AG \u00b622(g) (\u201cfailure to follow any court order regarding\nalcohol education, evaluation, treatment, or abstinence\u201d)). Applicant indicated in July\n2006 that his first DUI would be dismissed provided he not drink for 18 months and fulfill\nother conditions. He admitted in July 2006 that he had stopped drinking for only about\ntwo or three months. His December 1997 DUI was within 18 months of his first offense.\nApplicant bears a particularly heavy burden to overcome the serious judgment\nconcerns raised by repeated intoxication and drunk driving. His December 1997 DUI\nfollowed his completion of an eight-week alcohol education course. Six months of\noutpatient counseling after that offense did not prevent him from again driving under the\ninfluence in January 2006. This history of relapse precludes favorable consideration of\nmitigating condition \u00b6 AG 23(a) (\u201cso much time has passed, or the behavior was so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nor does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment\u201d).\nAs of July 2006, Applicant was going out with his brother every other weekend to\nfriends\u2019 homes and drinking about three beers over five hours time. In July 2007,\nApplicant told a government investigator that he consumed only two beers during the\nChristmas holiday (December 25, 2006), and none since. However, in December 2007\nhe told DOHA that his last use of alcohol was on New Year\u2019s Eve in 2006 and that he\nconsumed about six beers, an amount greater than he had previously reported (\u201cNew\nYear\u2019s Eve 2006. Beer only, approx. 6 cans). Irrespective of whether Applicant drank on\nDecember 25 or December 31, 2006, his consumption of six beers at a sitting after a\nthird DUI and while in a court-mandated alcohol counseling program, was irresponsible.\nHe has yet to demonstrate the sustained reform required under AG \u00b6 23(b) (\u201cthe\nindividual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides\nevidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of\nabstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser)\u201d).\nMitigating condition AG \u00b6 23(c) (\u201cthe individual is a current employee who is\nparticipating in a counseling or treatment program, has no history of previous treatment\nand relapse, and is making satisfactory progress\u201d) cannot be applied because of the\nrecurrence of drunk driving after completing court-ordered counseling for a previous\noffense. Applicant is credited with completing his latest court-mandated outpatient\nprogram, but the fill-in-the-blanks form letter confirming his successful completion falls\nshort of the favorable prognosis required under AG \u00b6 23(d) (\u201cthe individual has\nsuccessfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along with any\nrequired aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified\nconsumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as\nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization and has\nreceived a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a licensed\nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment\nprogram\u201d). It provides no information about Applicant\u2019s progress during treatment, his\nprognosis for the future, the qualifications of his counselor, or any recommendations, if\n\n9\nappropriate, to prevent recurrence. A recent favorable assessment by a qualified\nclinician could have gone a long way toward dispelling the Guideline G concerns raised\nby his irresponsible drinking after his third DUI. It cannot be determined from the limited\nrecord available for review whether his counselor even knew that he had consumed as\nmany as six beers on or about December 31, 2006, when he was still in active\ncounseling.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAbout two weeks after his arrest for his third DUI, Applicant completed an EPSQ\non which he disclosed his then very recent arrest, as a pending charge in response to\nquestion 23, and as an alcohol or drug related offense in response to question 24.\nApplicant did not report his two previous DUI offenses, even though they fell within the\nscope of question 24 (\u201cHave you ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s)\nrelated to alcohol or drugs?\u201d), but he denies any intentional falsification:\nOn my Electronic Personnel Security Questionnaire, I understood\n\u2018Question 24' to require information from a period of 7 years back in my\nhistory. I was not intentionally being deceitful or in any way falsifying my\ninformation. I explained this in detail at my first interview with an\ninvestigator in the summer of 2006 (Item 4).\nA candid disclosure of his recent arrest did not relieve him of his obligation to\nreport his earlier DUI offenses. However, a mistaken belief held in good faith that he\nhad complied with his obligation would negate the willful intent required under AG \u00b6\n16(a) (\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to\nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities\u201d).\nWhen the subject of the EPSQ omission was broached during his first interview\nheld in July 2006, Applicant indicated that he first completed his security forms in 2004.\nHe listed only the 1998 [sic] offense, because he thought he needed to go back only\nseven years (see Item 6). The record available for review does not include any security\nclearance application completed in 2004, so Applicant\u2019s claim of having listed the\nsecond DUI on an earlier form cannot be corroborated. Yet, it is also clear that as of\n\nW hile there is conflicting evidence about the amount and date of Applicant\u2019s last involvement with alcohol,\n4\nthe government did not allege any additional personal conduct concerns beyond the EPSQ omissions.\n10\nJuly 2006, Applicant still thought that the security clearance application only had a\nseven-year scope. As of February 2006 when he completed the EPSQ at issue, more\nthan seven years had passed since his second DUI. Had Applicant intended to conceal\nhis drunk driving from the government, it stands to reason he would not have disclosed\nthat he had been arrested only two weeks before. His denial of any intentional\nconcealment is accepted. AG \u00b6 16(a) does not apply to his EPSQ omissions.  \n4\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s abuse of alcohol in 2006\nrenewed concerns about his judgment and reliability that cannot be attributed to youthful\nindiscretion. He continued to drink every other weekend after his third DUI, and in\nirresponsible amounts on at least one occasion while undergoing court-ordered\ncounseling. What insight Applicant has gained into his drinking behavior is not currently\nbeing reinforced through any association with AA or other similar recovery organization.\nWhile that may not be required to prevent a recurrence in his case, more time is\nrequired before I can safely conclude that his abuse of alcohol and related criminal\nconduct are safely in the past.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\n\n11\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

On \nJune 10, 2008, I was assigned the case. On June 26, 2008, DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing scheduling the hearing held on August 7, 2008. The government offered \nExhibits (Ex.) 1 through 9, which were admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on his \nown behalf and submitted Exhibits A through H, which were admitted into evidence. On \nAugust 19, 2008, the transcript (Tr.) was received.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to the PRC. The request and the attached documents were \nincluded in the record as Hearing Exhibits (Ex) I\u2500VI. The facts administratively noticed \nare set out in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a, 1.b, and 1.c, with explanations.  \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old linguist who has been employed by a defense \ncontractor working with a U.S. Army Joint Task Force (JTF) since August 2002. He is \nseeking to maintain a secret security clearance granted in April 2004. (Ex. 2) Applicant\u2019s \nimmediate supervisor places him in the top three per cent of the 90 plus linguists he \nsupervises. (Tr. 26) Applicant is one of the busiest translators at the JTF. (Tr. 25, 28) \nThe site manager states Applicant is a very dedicated, hard working individual. Neither \nhis supervisor nor the site manager have ever had a problem with Applicant or had a \ncomplaint about Applicant. (Tr. 30, 31) \n \nApplicant has received seven certificates of appreciation and a letter of \nrecommendation for his work with the JTF. (Exs. A, F) Applicant\u2019s work has been \nbeyond reproach. He handles pressure, physical hardships, and emotional stress \nadmirably. (Ex. F) His unique skills have made significant contributions to the JTF\u2019s \nmission. (Ex. G) A co-linguist and senior site representative says Applicant is very proud \nof his citizenship and very proud of his contribution to the mission. (Tr. 36) \n \n \n2 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) approved by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of \nDefense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n\n \n \n \n3\nApplicant has endured difficult working conditions to get the mission \naccomplished. He has shown \u201cthe true meaning of dedication and personal courage on \na daily basis.\u201d (Ex. B) Applicant has not only provided meticulous insight into the \nlanguage, but more critically of the social, economic, and religious culture of his native \npeople. (Exs. C, G) He is an innovative, self\u2013starter, exceeds expectations, handles \npressure well, volunteers for overtime to meet deadlines and completes all tasks \nassigned. (Exs. C, G) He is a model citizen who understands and respects the benefits \nof the U.S. (Ex. D) He is dedicated, reliable, and an invaluable asset to the mission. (Tr. \n67)  \n \n \nIn 1972, Applicant was born in the PRC. At age 14, Applicant went to art college. \nIn 1989, he graduated from college at the time as the Tiananmen Square student \nuprising. The uprising opened his mind to expressing his rights and feelings against the \nChinese government. (Tr. 40) In January 1991, Applicant was selected to be an \nentertainer as part of a cultural entertainment dance ensemble at a theme park, in \nChina. (Tr. 40) Applicant was a folk dancer. This theme park was 3,000 miles from his \nhome. (Tr. 53) In October 1994, Applicant came to the U.S. to work at a Chinese theme \npark sponsored by the Chinese government. He worked at the park until 1995, when an \nacquaintance told Applicant not to return home, because someone Applicant knew and \ntalked with had been arrested and placed in jail. (Tr. 41) Applicant sought and received \npolitical asylum. (Ex. 3) In 1997, Applicant attended a U.S. university.  \n \nIn July 2003, Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen. (Ex. 1) Since coming \nto the U.S. he has had no foreign travel except for travel with his job with the JTF. He \nhas no foreign passport. (Ex. 8) In 2001, Applicant was married to a native born U.S. \ncitizen and they have one child, a son born in February 2002. In 2005, he was divorced. \nApplicant calls his son daily. (Tr. 57) His job requires him to be gone for three or four \nmonths before returning home for five or six days. (Tr. 56)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents, five brothers, and sister live in the PRC. His parents are \nretired medical doctors who operate a drug store. (Tr. 54) One of his brothers is in the \nclothing business, another is a cook, one is a nurse, and the last is a pharmacist. His \nsister is a student. (Tr. 57, Ex. 6) Applicant has a cousin who was adopted by his \nparents and helps them in their home. (Tr. 59) None of his relatives work for a foreign \ngovernment nor have any served in a foreign military.  \n \nApplicant talks with his parents every three or four months, asking about their \nhealth and daily lives. (Tr. 16, Exs. 4, 6) He last talked with them six months ago. He \nlast talked to one brother two or three years ago and another brother three or four years \nago. He has not spoken to his three other brothers since 1994. He last spoke to his \nsister three years ago. His sister was one year old when he last saw her. (Ex. 8) In \n2005, Applicant sent his younger brother money to help with this brother\u2019s tuition. (Tr. \n50) He recently sent his mother money because she was having heart surgery. (Tr. 50) \n \nApplicant assumes all telephone calls from the Xinjiang Uyghur region to foreign \npersons will be monitored by the Chinese government. (Tr. 44, Ex. 7) His family is \n\n \n \n \n4\niwan. \n                                                          \nunaware of what he does. Applicant believes the Chinese authorities claim of Uyghur \nterrorism is simply an excuse to further suppress the Uyghur people. (Tr. 64)  \n \nTwice since he has been in the U.S., Chinese authorities have asked his parents \nabout him. When his parents were asked when Applicant was coming home and what \nhe was doing in the U.S. (Ex. 7) Applicant\u2019s father said Applicant was studying in \ncollege and he had no control over Applicant or when he would return. (Tr. 45) Applicant \nbelieves the questioning occurred in 1996 or 1997 and knows it occurred before 2000. \n(Tr. 75)  \n \nShould pressure be brought against his foreign relatives, Applicant would notify \nthe U.S. government and the F.B.I. He understands that people sometimes are required \nto make sacrifices for a good cause. (Tr. 18) He is only one person and understands he \nmust never negotiate or talk with the Chinese government. His main concern is for the \nU.S. and his family in the U.S. (Tr. 18)  \n \nApplicant has $25,000 in savings, $40,000 in his 401(k) retirement plan, and \n$85,000 in stock market investments, all located in the U.S. (Ex. 6) He has no foreign \ninvestment. Applicant describes his naturalization as the best and happiest day of his \nlife. (Tr. 60) He will never return to the land of his birth until the Chinese government \nbecomes democratic. (Tr. 17) He has no sympathy for the Chinese government or the \nChinese communist party. (Tr. 42) Applicant states he is a loyal, patriotic citizen who \nwould die for American interests, the American people, and his son. (Tr. 65) \n \nChina \n \nChina is a large and economically powerful country, with a population of over a \nbillion people. It has an authoritarian government dominated by the Chinese Communist \nParty.3 China possesses large and increasingly sophisticated military forces, which \ninclude strategic nuclear weapons and missiles.4 Since the cold war, the U.S. and \nChina have been rivals with particular disagreement on the status of Ta\n \nThe U.S. is a primary intelligence target of China because of the U.S. role as a \nglobal superpower.5 China operates an aggressive clandestine effort to acquire \ntechnology.

Chinese authorities open and censor domestic and international mail.9 \n \n \nThe largest ethnic group in China is the Han Chinese, which constitutes about 92 \nper cent of the total population.10 Han control of the XUAR\u2019s political and economic \ninstitutions also contributed to heightened tension. Government policies has brought \neconomic improvements to the XUAR with Han residents received a disproportionate \nshare of the benefits.11  \n \n \nSince 2001, authorities have increased repression in the Xinjiang Uyghur \nAutonomous Region (XUAR), targeting in particular the region\u2019s ethnic Uyghur \npopulation. The government continues to repress Uyghurs expressing peaceful political \ndissent and independent religious views.12 The XUAR government tightened measures \nthat diluted expression of Uyghur identity, including measures to reduce education in \nethnic minority languages and to institute language requirements that disadvantage \nethnic minority teachers.13 The Chinese government promotes Han migration into the \nXUAR.  \n \n \nThe Uyghurs were one of the largest Turkic peoples living in Central Asia. In \n1949, East Turkestan was annexed by the PRC. (Tr. 39) The name Xinjiang, which \nmeans \u201cnew territory\u201d in Chinese, is an offensive term to many Uyghur people. The \nChinese government often refers to Uyghur nationalists as \u201cterrorists.\u201d  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \n \n7  Background Note on China (Ex. I) at 9.

V) \n \n\n \n \n \n6\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nForeign Influence  \n \nAG & 6 expresses the security concerns regarding foreign influence: \n \n\n \n \n \n7\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \n \nAG & 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual=s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual=s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; \n \n(c) counterintelligence information, that may be classified, indicates that \nthe individual=s access to protected information may involve unacceptable \nrisk to national security; \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of their \ncitizenship status, if the potential for adverse foreign influence or duress \nexists; \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which \ncould subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation;  \n \n \n(f) failure to report, when required, association with foreign national; \n \n(g) unauthorized association with a suspected or known agent, associate, \nor employee of a foreign intelligence service; \n \n(h) indications that representatives or nations from a foreign country are \nacting to increase the vulnerability of the individual to possible future \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n\n \n \n \n8\n(i) conduct, especially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make \nthe individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign \nperson, group, government, or country.  \n \nAG & 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual=s sense of \nloyalty or obligations to the foreign person, group, government, or country \nis so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.  \n \nAG && 7(a) and 7 (b) applies because his parents and siblings live and are \nresidents of the XGAR, a part of the PRC. In every case where a sibling lives overseas, \nthere is a risk of pressure on this relative and through them upon the holder of a security \nclearance. Under the facts of this case, a heightened risk for exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation pressure, or coercion is substantiated. This potential pressure also raises \na possible conflict of interest. However, Applicant has significant ties to the U.S. and his \nonly tie to the PRC is his relatives. \n \nApplicant\u2019s work as a linguist and interpreter supports the U.S. military mission. \nThe Army holds his work in high regard. He provided more than language interpretation \nskills. He explained local cultural nuances and practices which greatly assisted the \nmilitary in accomplishing its mission. He has worked very hard to helping the Army and \nhas developed a high level of trust with the Army. For the past six years, Applicant has \n\n \n \n \n9\ndone excellent work with the U.S. Army Joint Task Force. There have been no \ncomplaints or actions taken against him. His duty performance is outstanding. \n \nApplicant\u2019s contact with his parents is limited to every four to six months. He has \nnot had any contact with three siblings since 1994 and very limited contact with two \nbrothers and a sister. Even though his contact with his parents is minimal, due to the \nparent son relationship it can not be said the relationship is casual. \n \nAG && 8(a) and 8(c) partially apply because \u201cit is unlikely [he] will be place in a \nposition of having to choose between the interest of [his parents and siblings] and the \ninterest of the U.S.\u201d His infrequent or non existent contacts and not particularly close \nrelationship with his siblings have a very low potential for forcing him to choose between \nthe United States and the PRC. Applicant has no love for the Chinese government or \nthe Chinese Communist party. The Chinese government is taking systematic steps to \nsuppress the Uyghur people. Applicant will not return to his home land until China \nbecomes democratic. He met his burden of showing there is \u201clittle likelihood that [his \nrelationship with his PRC relatives] could create a risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation.\u201d \n \nAG & 8(b) partially applies. There is no evidence that his parents or siblings are \nor have been political activists or are challenging the policies of the Chinese \nGovernment. There is no evidence his parents or siblings currently work or have ever \nworked for the Chinese military, or new media, or that of any other foreign government. \nMore than ten years ago, shortly after Applicant stayed in the U.S. the Chinese \nauthorities asked his parents when Applicant was coming home and what he was doing \nin the U.S.  \n \nSince 2000, there is no evidence that terrorists or the Chinese Government have \napproached or threatened Applicant, his parents, or siblings for any reason. There is no \nevidence that his relatives living in the PRC currently engages in activities which would \nbring attention to them or that they or other Chinese elements are even aware of \nApplicant\u2019s work. As such, there is a reduced possibility that his relatives or Applicant \nwould be targets for coercion or exploitation. \n \nApplicant has \u201csuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the \nU.S., [he] can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterest.\u201d His son is a U.S. citizen, residing in the United States. In 1991, seventeen \nyears ago, Applicant left his home to work at a folk dancer at a theme park 3000 miles \nfrom his home. In 1994, he came to a Chinese sponsored theme park in the U.S. This \nwas the last time he saw his parents and siblings. In 1995, he obtained political asylum. \nIn July 2003, on the happiest and best day of his life, Applicant became a naturalized \nU.S. citizen. \n \nAG & 8 (f) applies because he has no interest in property in any foreign country \nand he has significant U.S. property and assets. However, this mitigating factor has very \nlimited weight in cases where AG && 7(a) and 7 (b) apply. \n \n\n \n \n \n10\n                                                          \nThere is little likelihood that Applicant will be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of the U.S. and a foreign entity. Likewise, because of his \nclose ties and his loyalties to the U.S., including his son (who is a U.S. born citizen); he \nwould resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. These mitigating conditions \ntaken together are sufficient to fully overcome the foreign influence security concerns. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \nProtection of our national security is of paramount concern. Security clearance \ndecisions are not intended to assign guilt or to impose further punishment for past \ntransgressions. Rather, the objective of the adjudicative process is the fair-minded, \ncommonsense assessment of a person=s trustworthiness and fitness for access to \nclassified information. In reaching this decision, I have considered the whole person \nconcept in evaluating Applicant=s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national \ninterests. I considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to XUAR and the heavy \nburden an Applicant carries when he has family members in a foreign country.  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nSeventeen years ago, Applicant left the PRC, which was the last time he saw his \nparents and siblings. Because he guides Army personal on local customs and nuances \nrelated to the spoken word and performs outstanding work, the Army views him as a \nvaluable resource in helping it achieve its mission with the JTF. Applicant\u2019s six years of \nservice comprised four or five months of overseas tours before a brief return to his \nhome. His service providing crucial assistance in the Global War on Terrorism is \nsuccessful in the past because of his language and cultural skills gained in the XGAR 14  \n \n14In ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov.14, 2006), the Appeal Board recognized an \nexception to the general rule in Guideline B cases when \u201can applicant has established by credible, \nindependent evidence that his compliance with security procedures and regulations occurs in the context \nof dangerous, high-risk circumstances in which the applicant had made a significant contribution to the \n\n \n \n \n11\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n \nWhile danger certainly exists for all living in the XGAR, Applicant\u2019s parents and \nsiblings are in no greater danger than any other individual living and working there. \nApplicant has no love for the Chinese government due to the government\u2019s suppression \nof the Uyghur people. He was given refugee status because of the hostility of the PRC \ngovernment for him and the XGAR people. \n \nI have carefully weighed the evidence in favor of Applicant against the \ngovernment=s concerns about Applicant=s ability to protect classified information. I find \nthat there is little potential for Applicant to be pressured, coerced, or exploited because \nhe has relatives living in PRC. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions \nor doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the foreign influence security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.c: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the SOR allegations. She is a 39-year-old consultant employed by a defense contractor since May 2005. She has not previously held a clearance. The SOR alleges, Applicant admits, and government exhibits substantiate, four delinquent debts to the Internal Revenue Service, for tax years 2000, 2002, 2004, and 2005, totaling over $27,000. Applicant asserts, without corroboration that the debt at SOR 1.a. has been reduced to $2,000. These are joint debts with her husband, from whom she separated in May 2008, and with whom there are no pending divorce proceedings. Applicant attributes the initial debt in 2000 to her husband\u2019s failure to have adequate federal income tax withholding (FITW) for that tax year. However, she also failed to have adequate FITW for that year from her part-time job as a fitness instructor. The tax debts for 2002 and 2004, were also due to inadequate FITW. The 2005 tax debt was due to taxes and penalties on a pre-mature distribution from her 401K account\u2014money that she and her husband used as a down payment on a home they bought. Applicant had tax refunds in tax years 2001, 2003, 2006, and 2007 that were seized by the IRS to reduce her tax debt. In January 2008, the latest record date in evidence, Applicant still owed over $24,000. The 2000 tax debt had been reduced to just over $4,000, but the 2002, 2004, and 2005 tax debts continue to grow through penalties and interest. According to Applicant, she and her husband entered ",

Glendon, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nOn 5 August 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline\nF.  Applicant\u2019s undated answer arrived at DOHA 3 September 2008, and requested a\n1\nhearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 2 October 2008, and I convened a hearing 30\nOctober 2008.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 6 November 2008.\n2\nJanuary 8, 2009\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations. She is a 39-year-old consultant\nemployed by a defense contractor since May 2005. She has not previously held a\nclearance.\nThe SOR alleges, Applicant admits, and government exhibits substantiate, four\ndelinquent debts to the Internal Revenue Service, for tax years 2000, 2002, 2004, and\n2005, totaling over $27,000. Applicant asserts, without corroboration that the debt at\nSOR 1.a. has been reduced to $2,000. These are joint debts with her husband, from\nwhom she separated in May 2008, and with whom there are no pending divorce\nproceedings.\nApplicant attributes the initial debt in 2000 to her husband\u2019s failure to have\nadequate federal income tax withholding (FITW) for that tax year. However, she also\nfailed to have adequate FITW for that year from her part-time job as a fitness instructor.\nThe tax debts for 2002 and 2004, were also due to inadequate FITW. The 2005 tax debt\nwas due to taxes and penalties on a pre-mature distribution from her 401K\naccount\u2014money that she and her husband used as a down payment on a home they\nbought. Applicant had tax refunds in tax years 2001, 2003, 2006, and 2007 that were\nseized by the IRS to reduce her tax debt. In January 2008, the latest record date in\nevidence, Applicant still owed over $24,000. The 2000 tax debt had been reduced to\njust over $4,000, but the 2002, 2004, and 2005 tax debts continue to grow through\npenalties and interest.\nAccording to Applicant, she and her husband entered into a repayment plan with\nthe IRS after the 2000 debt arose (and to which the other tax debts were added). The\nrecord does not clearly indicate when the initial plan was instituted. Record evidence\n(G.E. 5) reflects that the IRS filed a tax lien against Applicant and her husband in\nFebruary 2007, and a formal repayment plan was established in late March 2007.\nApplicant claims that the first she knew he was not making the required payments was\nin July/August 2007, when the IRS garnished her wages to satisfy the lien. Applicant\nthen assumed the payments. It appears that the IRS garnished $1,000 per month for a\ncouple of months. It also appears that Applicant got the monthly obligation reduced to\n$500 per month in September 2007, so she could continue to make her mortgage\npayments. Applicant documented $500 payments in November 2007, December 2007,\nand January 2008. She did not document any payments since January 2008.\nAfter Applicant and her husband separated in May 2008, she remained in the\nmarital home. He pays the utility bills, but does not contribute to the mortgage. The\nhouse is on the market to be sold. Applicant has considered cashing in more of her\n401k to satisfy the IRS debt, but recent declines in the market leave the account value\nbelow the current IRS balance.\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n3\n\u00b619.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n4\n3\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.3\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant has a history of financial\ndifficulties dating to at least 2000.  Although her husband bears some responsibility for\n4\nthe tax debts through his failure to have adequate FITW, Applicant also failed to have\nadequate FITW in her part-time job. That, along with their apparent joint decision to\ncash out some of their 401k plans to make a down-payment on a house, suggests that if\nthey were not living beyond their means, they were living very close to that line.\n\n\u00b620 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n5\nit is unlikely to recur . . . \n\u00b620.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n6\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b620.(c)  the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that\n7\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control;\n,\u00b620.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n8\n4\nThe mitigating factors for financial considerations provide little help to Applicant.\nHer financial difficulties are both recent and multiple.  The problems are not largely due\n5\nto circumstances beyond her control, and her response has been mixed.  She has not\n6\ndocumented continued payment after January 2008, and annual seizure of her tax\nrefund by the IRS hardly constitutes a repayment plan. Further, her current financial\nsituation is fairly characterized as being in flux. She and her husband have recently\nseparated. There are no divorce proceedings pending, nor is there any movement\ntoward a property settlement. The husband appears to not be paying his fair share of\ncontinuing household expenses. There is no evidence that Applicant has undertaken\nfinancial counseling. She has not demonstrated that the problem has been brought\nsubstantially under control.  The payments that have been paid have not been paid in a\n7\ntimely, good-faith effort.  The record does not indicate when, if ever, her financial\n8\nsituation will be settled enough for her to make clear progress on her tax debt. I\nconclude Guideline F against Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1. Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph d:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant.

After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has either been self-employed or worked for two defense contractors since 1987. He has held a security clearance at several levels since 1998. In 2004, when he held a top secret clearance, he applied to the National Security Agency for NSA access for Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI).

Noel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n__________\nDecision\n__________\nABLARD, Charles D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant failed to mitigate security concerns regarding Sexual Behavior\n(Guideline D), and Personal Conduct (Guideline E). Clearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nOn June 2, 2004, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).\nOn April 15, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and\nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended,\nmodified and revised. The SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines D and E.\nThe SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative\nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative\njudge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or\nrevoked.\nApril 29, 2009\n\n2\n                                     \nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations in a sworn statement signed on April\n28, 2008, and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a\nhearing. Documents were attached to the answer with explanatory information. A\ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated January 16, 2009, was\nprovided to him, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit\nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant provided no additional\nmaterial. The case was assigned to me on March 23, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted all of the factual allegations of the SOR in his answer\nregarding sexual behavior, but stated that he no longer engaged in the activity cited in\nthe SOR and has not done so since 2006. After a complete and thorough review of the\nevidence of record, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has either been\nself-employed or worked for two defense contractors since 1987. He has held a security\nclearance at several levels since 1998. In 2004, when he held a top secret clearance,\nhe applied to the National Security Agency for NSA access for Sensitive\nCompartmented Information (SCI). His application was denied in June 2005 (Item 9) on\nthe same grounds that are alleged in this matter. The denial occurred after a polygraph\ntest was administered to him and he admitted the conduct that is alleged here and in the\nNSA application. \nSince 1990 Applicant has used the services of prostitutes three or four times a\nyear until early 2006. He obtained their services through local massage parlors while\nliving at home. When he traveled on business trips he found prostitutes through\nnewspaper ads. He regularly used the services while holding a security clearance and\nduring the course of the NSA investigation in 2004 (Item 11). He continued to use their\nservices after being denied SCI clearance. He was never arrested for any of the\nconduct. \nApplicant has been married for 27 years and has two grown sons. His wife is\nunaware of the conduct that led to this proceeding. He would be embarrassed if his wife\nand others found out. However, he knows he could not be blackmailed. In 2006 he\ndeveloped an infection that he feared might be sexually transmitted. He then decided\nhis past activity with prostitutes was too risky to continue. Also, his age caused him to\nre-evaluate his conduct since his interest in sex was declining (Item 5).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n3\n                                     \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered For access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of\nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d\ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information.\nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition,\nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant]\nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the\nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall\nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995),\nSection 3.\nAnalysis\nGuideline D Sexual Behavior\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all\nappropriate legal precepts, factors and conditions above, I conclude the following with\nrespect to all allegations set forth in the SOR: \n\n4\n                                     \nAG \u00b6 12 expresses the security concern as follows:\nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or\nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may\nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or\nduress can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness\nand ability to protect classified information. No adverse inference\nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the\nbasis of the sexual orientation of the individual.\nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has\nbeen prosecuted;\n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual behavior\nthat the person is unable to stop or that may be symptomatic of a\npersonality disorder;\n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and\n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion\nor judgment.\nOver a period of 15 years, Applicant engaged in conduct that was criminal in\nnature and made himself vulnerable to undue influence or coercion that might cause him\nto act in a manner inconsistent with the national security interests of the United States.\nThus, I conclude that a prima facie case was established by the government. \nAG \u00b6 14 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no\nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature;\n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under\nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet.\n\n5\n                                     \n        While the conduct started many years ago it continued until at least three years\nago. During that period, Applicant held a security clearance and his actions placed him\nin a vulnerable position. This was risk-taking that a person with a security clearance\nshould not have done knowing that he was placing himself in a vulnerable situation.\nWhile the actions may have been private in the sense that others were not\nknowledgeable about them, they were indiscreet acts. On each occasion, he was\nexposed to possible criminal repercussions. None of the mitigating conditions are\napplicable. \nGuideline E Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. With respect to the personal conduct concerns involving Applicant\u2019s sexual\nbehavior, the pertinent disqualifying conditions are AG \u00b6\u00b616 (e)(1) and (g) which state:\n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct,\nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as\n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal,\nprofessional, or community standing; and\n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity. \nThe conduct of Applicant with prostitutes over a 15 year period clearly\nestablishes the basis of a security concern under personal conduct. This conduct was\nalso recognized by the NSA in the cited proceeding to deny him SCI clearance. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;\n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was\ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of\nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the\nindividual specifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon\nbeing made aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the\ninformation, the individual cooperated fully and truthfully;\n\n6\n                                     \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior\nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it\nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained\ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to\nalleviate \nthe \nstressors, \ncircumstances, \nor \nfactors \nthat \ncaused\nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such\nbehavior is unlikely to recur;\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;\n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable\nreliability; and\n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or\noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules\nand regulations.\nWhile the involvement in the criminal activity may have ceased in 2006, the past\nactivities continue to be a problem for exploitation and do not justify application of AG \u00b6\n17(g). All other mitigating conditions are inapplicable to the facts in this matter. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.\n\n7\n                                     \n After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and\ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the\nsecurity concerns pertaining to sexual behavior and personal conduct allegations.\n  I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518 (1988), a careful consideration of the whole person factors and supporting\nevidence, application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative process, and\ninterpretation of my responsibilities under the guidelines. Applicant has not mitigated or\novercome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible\nfor access to classified information.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.: Against Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a.:Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b.:Against Applicant \nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security\nclearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied.\nCharles D. Ablard\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP), on September 29, 2006. On February 22, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F for Applicant. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nAugust 26, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 24, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to \nproceed on April 25, 2008, and I received the case assignment on May 8, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 8, 2008, scheduling the hearing for June 5, \n2008. On June 4, 2008, DOHA issued an amended notice of hearing changing the \nhearing date to June 24, 2008. The hearing was held as scheduled. \n \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were \nreceived without objection. The Applicant offered Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through \nJ, which were received without objection, and testified on his own behalf.  \n \nI held the record open until July 11, 2008 to afford the Applicant the opportunity \nto submit additional documents on his behalf. Applicant timely submitted AE K through \nN without objection, which were forwarded to me by Department Counsel by \nMemorandum, dated July 14, 2008 (Exhibit (Ex.) I). DOHA received the transcript of \nthe hearing (Tr.) on July 2, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant denied \u00b6 1, and admitted \u00b6 1.a. His admission is incorporated herein \nas findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 52-year-old quality assurance director, who has been employed \nby his defense contractor employer since May 2001. He is a first time applicant for a \nsecurity clearance. GE 1, Tr. 15, 20-21. \n \nApplicant attended college and was awarded a bachelor of arts degree in \neconomics. After completing college, he attended graduate school and was awarded a \nmaster\u2019s degree in labor relations and collective bargaining. GE 1, Tr. 17-21. Applicant \nhas been married to his wife since August 1975. Applicant and his wife have two adult \nchildren from that marriage. GE 1, Tr. 15-17. \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed his financial situation and \nincluded the review of his e-QIP, December Response to Written Interrogatories, and \nOctober 2006 credit report. GE 1 \u2013 3. \n \nThe SOR identified one line item, which consists of a single credit card \ncollection account in the approximate amount of $53,000. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) \n \nThe original debt was incurred in the 1998 \u2013 1999 timeframe when Applicant \nand his wife owned a wholesale candy business. Tr. 41. They owned this business \nfrom May 1996 to July 2000, and the business ultimately failed. Applicant stated at the \ntime he need to maintain his cash flow and \u201cwas basically borrowing from Peter to pay \nPaul.\u201d GE 1, Tr. 39. When the debt initially became past due in August 2001, it was \n$18,465. GE 2, p. 66. The debt owner has changed at least two times adding to \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s difficulty in resolving it. Tr. 41-42. As a result of interest and penalties, the \ncurrent debt owner claims the debt has increased to $53,000. Tr. 42-45. \n \nApplicant has made significant efforts to settle or otherwise resolve this debt. \nApplicant testified he initiated numerous telephone inquiries to resolve this debt. \nAdditionally, Applicant and his wife applied for a loan to pay off this debt in full, which \nwas initially approved in August 2005 and later denied in November 2005. AE I, Tr. \n37-38. In November 2006, Applicant contacted the law firm representing the current \ndebt holder, and offered to settle the debt for $3,600. Applicant based his settlement \noffer on the fact he believed the debt holder had purchased the debt for approximately \n$1,800. The attorney informed Applicant the debt holder claimed Applicant owed \n$46,000. The debt holder made a firm counter offer of $26,500, an amount Applicant \ndid not have and an amount Applicant did not believe was fair and reasonable. GE 2 \nTr. 30-37, 59-66. \n \nAlthough the statute of limitations has run under applicable state law for the \ncreditor to legally collect this debt, Applicant desires to reach a fair and reasonable \nsettlement. Tr. 46-49, 66-69. Post-hearing, Applicant submitted documentation that he \nhas retained an attorney for the sole purpose of resolving this debt. Applicant\u2019s \nattorney has initiated contact with the creditor and as of this writing, the matter is still \npending. AE L. \n \nApplicant submitted documentation of other debts, recent and past, reflecting \nhis accounts are current and in good standing, and that his finances are in good order. \nAE A, AE D \u2013 AE H, AE J. Applicant\u2019s Facility Security Officer (FSO) submitted a \nreference letter indicating he has had a 15-year personal and professional relationship \nwith Applicant and his family. The FSO stated Applicant \u201cis presently entrusted with \nensuring that the product really does protect our Government\u2019s secrets and the lives of \nits Service Men and Women. And, [Applicant] is entrusted with sharing information \nwith other companies without releasing sensitive information.\u201d He trusts Applicant fully \nand recommended him for a clearance. AE M. Applicant\u2019s most recent employee \nevaluation rates Applicant as \u201cSignificantly exceeds expectations\u201d in all categories. AE \nN. Applicant\u2019s December 2007 Personal Financial Statement reflects a net monthly \nremainder of $2,190. GE 2. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In \naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are \nuseful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n  \n  \nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations),1 the Government\u2019s concern is \nthat an Applicant\u2019s: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n \n1  Guideline \u00b6 18. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nApplicant\u2019s sole debt and only allegation in SOR is a credit card bill that \noriginally was $18,465 in 2001 that has increased to $53,000 as a result of interest \nand penalties. The Government established its case through Applicant\u2019s admission \nand evidence submitted. Of the nine Financial Considerations Disqualifying \nConditions, two are applicable: \u00b6 19(a): \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d and \n\u00b6 19(c): \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d  \n \n \nApplicant encountered financial difficulty when his wholesale candy business \nfailed in 2000. This disappointment was further compounded by lingering business-\nrelated debts which apart from this debt have all been paid or resolved. Applicant has \nmade noteworthy efforts to resolve this debt. During his hearing, he expressed \nfrustration over the fact that his debt had increased to the extent it did and the difficulty \nhe had in contacting a creditor representative and negotiating a fair and reasonable \nsettlement. His efforts to resolve this debt in 2006 did not prove to be successful.  \n \nTo address the ongoing Government concerns, Applicant has taken the \nsignificant step of incurring the cost of retaining an attorney for the sole purpose of \nresolving this debt. It is unknown as of this writing whether Applicant\u2019s efforts have \nnetted a satisfactory resolution. \n \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,2 I conclude three of the six \nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Conditions are applicable or partially applicable: \u00b6 \n20(b) \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances;\u201d \u00b6 20(d) \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;\u201d and \u00b6 20(e) \u201cthe individual has a \nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of \nthe problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or \nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d \n \nI am convinced by Applicant\u2019s testimony and documented efforts that he is \nacting responsibly under the circumstances, and has initiated a good-faith effort to pay \nor resolve this debt. Apart from this debt, Applicant\u2019s financial house is in order, and \nhe is a valued and trusted employee, who is making a contribution to the nation\u2019s \ndefense effort. \n \n2  See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 \nat 4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for FC MC 1, all debts are considered \nas a whole. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. Applicant met his ultimate \nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this \nconclusion, the whole person concept was given due consideration and that analysis \ndoes support a favorable decision. \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d3 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nhe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The Applicant is 29, and he lives with his girlfriend and their two children. He is employed by a defense contractor and seeks to retain a security clearance previously granted in connection with his employment. Guideline F, Financial Considerations The Applicant began working in the Defense industry in January 2007. His financial problems began in approximately 2001, when he was injured on the job at the same time his partner had a child. Subsequent to that time, he went through a period of underemployment, he moved, and was the victim of identity theft and fraud committed by a former roommate. (Transcript at 33, 42, 46-48, 65-66.) When the Applicant began working for the Defense industry, he also began working to clean up his credit report. Some of the debts on his report were fraudulent, some had been paid but not removed and some were past due and had to be paid. The Applicant made a point by saying that the three credit reporting firms are not always consistent in their timing or in what they report. (Transcript at 71-72.) Subparagraph 1.a. The Applicant admits that he owed approximately $191.00 for a cable box he did not return. The Applicant testified that he made a payment arrangement with this creditor to pay $50.00 a month for four months. (Transcript at 32, 62-64.) The Applicant subsequently submitted emails showing that he had attempted to contact this creditor to complete the transaction without success. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G at 4-7.) Subparagra",

The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR on March 3, 2008, and requested a hearing\nbefore an Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on April\n1, 2008.  I received the case assignment on April 8, 2008.  DOHA issued a notice of\nhearing on April 18, 2008.  \n\n2\nThe hearing was convened on May 13, 2008.  The Government offered\nGovernment Exhibits 1 through 6, which were received without objection. Applicant\ntestified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through F, without\nobjection. The Applicant requested that the record remain open for the submission of\nadditional documents.  The Applicant submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G on May 29, 2008,\nand it was received without objection.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing on\nMay 22, 2008.  The record closed on May 30, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case\nfile, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 29, and he lives with his girlfriend and their two children.  He is\nemployed by a defense contractor and seeks to retain a security clearance previously\ngranted in connection with his employment.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Applicant began working in the Defense industry in January 2007.  His\nfinancial problems began in approximately 2001, when he was injured on the job at the\nsame time his partner had a child.  Subsequent to that time, he went through a period of\nunderemployment, he moved, and was the victim of identity theft and fraud committed\nby a former roommate.  (Transcript at 33, 42, 46-48, 65-66.)\nWhen the Applicant began working for the Defense industry, he also began\nworking to clean up his credit report.  Some of the debts on his report were fraudulent,\nsome had been paid but not removed and some were past due and had to be paid.  The\nApplicant made a point by saying that the three credit reporting firms are not always\nconsistent in their timing or in what they report.  (Transcript at 71-72.)\nSubparagraph 1.a.  The Applicant admits that he owed approximately $191.00\nfor a cable box he did not return.  The Applicant testified that he made a payment\narrangement with this creditor to pay $50.00 a month for four months.  (Transcript at 32,\n62-64.)  The Applicant subsequently submitted emails showing that he had attempted to\ncontact this creditor to complete the transaction without success.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G\nat 4-7.)  \nSubparagraph 1.b.  The Applicant denies this debt in the amount of $439.00.  He\nsubmits that this debt was fraudulently incurred in his name by his former roommate in\nanother state.  He has attempted to find the collection agency without success for\nseveral months.  (Transcript at 33, 64-68.)  In addition, the Applicant has filed a dispute\nwith the credit reporting agencies, as reflected in Government Exhibit 4 at 1 and\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit F at 2.  \nSubparagraph 1.c.  The Applicant denies this debt in the amount of $64.00.  He\nsubmits that this debt was fraudulently incurred in his name by his former roommate in\n\n3\nanother state.  The Applicant testified that he filed a dispute with the credit reporting\nagencies, and the debt was removed.  His April 1, 2008, credit report reflects this.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F.)  The Government\u2019s most recent credit report, dated May 13,\n2008,  still reflects the debt.  (Government Exhibit 6 at 2.)   \nSubparagraph 1.d.  The Applicant admits that he owed approximately $164.00 to\na credit union.  He paid this debt in full in approximately February 2006, as confirmed by\nhis credit report.  (Transcript at 34-35; Government Exhibit 2 at 12; Applicant\u2019s Exhibits\nB, D and Exhibit F at 3.)\nSubparagraph 1.e.  The Applicant admits that he may owe a hospital $244.00 in\nmedical expenses.  He further submits that he had insurance at the time, which should\nhave paid this debt.  He has not yet investigated the circumstances but, if his insurance\nwill not cover it, he will pay the debt.  The Applicant further testified that he disputed this\ndebt with the credit reporting service he was working with, but he does not have any\nproof of that.  (Transcript at 35-36, 72-73.)\nSubparagraphs 1.f. and 1.g.  The Applicant admits that he owes a bank at least\n$1,222.00 for a past due credit card.  The Applicant submits that this debt is a duplicate\nof that set forth in Subparagraph 1.g. and that, after he contacted his credit reporting\nagency, this debt is only set forth once.  (Transcript at 36, 73-75; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F at\n1-2.)  The Government\u2019s most recent credit report shows both debts.  (Government\nExhibit 6 at 2.)  The Applicant intends to settle this debt as soon as he can.\nSubparagraph 1.h.  The Applicant admits that he owes a telephone company a\npast due debt in the amount of $541.00.  This creditor will not work with the Applicant\nand he has been unable to reach a payment arrangement with them.  He intends to pay\nthis debt as soon as he can.  (Transcript at 37, 75-77.)\nSubparagraph 1.i.  The Applicant denies this debt to a telephone provider in the\namount of $325.00.  He submits that this debt was fraudulently incurred in his name by\nhis former roommate in another state.  The Applicant testified that he filed a dispute with\nthe credit reporting agencies, and the debt was removed.  This account was deleted\nfrom his credit report effective May 14, 2008.  (Transcript at 37, 77-79, 96-97;\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit G at 8.)\nSubparagraph 1.j.  The Applicant admits that he owes a telephone company a\npast due debt in the amount of $1,238.00.  The Applicant testified that he is in\nnegotiations with this creditor, and intends to pay this debt as soon as he can.\n(Transcript at 37, 81-82.)\nSubparagraph 1.k.  The Applicant admits that he may owe a hospital $267.00 in\nmedical expenses.  He further submits that he had insurance at the time, which should\nhave paid this debt.  He has not yet investigated the circumstances but, if his insurance\nwill not cover it, he will pay the debt.  He has been in contact with the creditor, but he\nhas not yet worked out any payment arrangement.  (Transcript at 37-38, 82-83.)\n\nIt is noted that the Applicant paid this debt, his largest, more than a year before the SOR was issued.\n1\n4\nSubparagraph 1.l.  The Applicant admits that he owed approximately $3,303.00\nto a bank for an automobile loan.  He paid this debt in full in approximately December\n2006, as confirmed by credit reports submitted by the Applicant and the Government.\n(Transcript at 38, 83-85, 87, 101-102; Government Exhibit 2 at 19-20, Exhibit 3 at 4 and\nExhibit 4 at 2.)1\nSubparagraph 1.m.  The Applicant admits that he may owe money to this\ncollection agency for a DirecTV bill, however he denies that the amount is $255.00.  He\ntestified that every time he requests information on the account, it is removed from his\ncredit report.  (Transcript at 38-39, 86-88, 98-99.)  He submitted evidence showing that\nhe had been in touch with DirecTV in November 2007 in an attempt to figure out the bill.\n(Government Exhibit 2 at 7.)  This debt appears in both 2007 credit reports in the\nrecord; one provided by the Government (Government Exhibit 3 at 4) and one from the\nApplicant (Government Exhibit 2 at 17).  However, the debt does not appear in any of\nthe 2008 credit reports submitted by the Government or the Applicant.  (Government\nExhibits 4, 5 and 6; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F.)\nSubparagraph 1.n.  The Applicant admits that he owed approximately $116.00 to\na law firm for a non-sufficient funds check.  He paid this debt in full in approximately\nApril 2005.  The law firm has a history of shady dealing, and he had to get another law\nfirm involved in order to get the entry removed from his credit reports.  (Transcript at 39,\n88-90; Government Exhibit 2 at 8.)  The Applicant was unable to provide proof of\npayment, other than the fact that the debt has been removed from his credit report. This\ndebt appears in both 2007 credit reports in the record; one provided by the Government\n(Government Exhibit 3 at 6) and one from the Applicant (Government Exhibit 2 at 19).\nHowever, the debt does not appear in any of the 2008 credit reports submitted by the\nGovernment or the Applicant.  (Government Exhibits 4, 5 and 6; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F.)\nSubparagraph 1.o.  The Applicant originally denied he owed this debt to an\ninsurance company in the amount of $82.00.  However, after he determined he could\nnot supply information to the insurance company showing that he did not owe the debt,\nhe made arrangements to pay it electronically.  (Transcript at 39-41, 90-93; Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits E and F at 2.)\nThe Applicant submitted that his current financial situation is stable.  He is able to\npay his current debts and work towards resolving his past due indebtedness.  In\naddition, his credit reports show that he has successfully paid off two automobile loans\nin the recent past.  His financial difficulties were over a limited time, and he is working to\npay those debts that are his and have removed from his credit report those that are not. \nAs of the date the record closed, he had paid $3,665.00 towards his debts in the\nSOR.  In addition, he is disputing in good faith an additional $1,579.00 worth of debt and\n$828.00 of debt had been removed as fraudulent.  His current admitted indebtedness\nstands at $3,703.00. \n\n5\nMitigation\nThe Applicant submitted letters from supervisors and co-workers.  They describe\nthe Applicant as \u201ctrustworthy, responsible and clearly an asset to his job.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit A.) \nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\n\n6\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise security concerns.\nThere is evidence in the record that the Applicant may have owed approximately\n$9,775.00 to the creditors named in the SOR.  The evidence is sufficient to raise this\npotentially disqualifying condition, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ In addition, AG\n\u00b6 20(b) states that it may be mitigating if \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblems were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, . . .\nunexpected medical emergency), and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances.\u201d\n The majority of the Applicant\u2019s past due indebtedness was incurred in 2001\nwhen the Applicant was injured on the job, lost his job and his girlfriend had a child.  As\ndescribed at length above, once the Applicant was employed in the Defense industry,\nhe had a plan to pay off his past due indebtedness and, for over one year, has been\nsuccessfully fulfilling it.  I find the behavior occurred under such unusual circumstances\nthat it is unlikely to recur, and it does not raise concerns about his current reliability,\n\nDepartment Counsel correctly states that the mere absence of an entry on a credit report is not, standing\n2\nalone, evidence that the debt has been paid.  However, here the Applicant has shown by documentary\nevidence his proactive attempts to work towards paying his bills.  In addition, as the Applicant correctly says,\neach of the three credit reporting agencies have different policies and may not post items at the same time.\n7\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. The evidence raises this potentially mitigating\ncondition.\n \nAG \u00b620(c) applies if \u201cthere are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control.\u201d  Evidence that Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts@ is also mitigating under \u00b620(d).\nFinally, it can also mitigating if \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the\nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of\nactions to resolve the issue.\u201d  (AG \u00b620(e).)  \nThe Applicant has shown by the use of email trails with several creditors that he\nhas been attempting to resolve his indebtedness for some time.  He has successfully\ndisputed some of his debts as being fraudulent or otherwise not valid. In addition, the\nApplicant is able to pay his current bills and also pay off his older debts.   His admitted\n2\npast due indebtedness has been reduced to less than $4,000.00.  He has control over\nhis current indebtedness, has paid a substantial amount of money towards the\narrearage, and has shown a more than credible willingness to continue paying off his\npast due indebtedness.  I conclude these potentially mitigating conditions apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b62(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b62(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant, by his own\nadmission, ran into a \u201cbad patch\u201d in 2001.  Rather than avoid them, once he obtained\nsteady and well-paying employment in the Defense industry, he immediately began to\npay his debts once he knew their full extent, and has already paid a substantial amount\ntowards them.  He has a plan to pay all of his debts and is fulfilling it.  He has behaved\n\n8\nreasonably and appropriately in trying to resolve his debts, thereby AG \u00b6 2(a)(6) applies.\nUnder the particular circumstances of this case, I find that there is little to no potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b62(a)(8)), and that the likelihood of\nrecurrence is close to nil (AG \u00b62(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.o.:\nFor the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Her eligibility for a security \nclearance is denied. \n \nApplicant completed and certified an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) on November 14, 2006.  On May 12, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing the security concerns under AG J, Criminal Conduct; AG G, Alcohol \nInvolvement; and AG F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \nJanuary 30, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn May 22, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR in writing, provided additional \nexplanations and attachments, and requested that her case be determined on the \nrecord in lieu of a hearing. On June 23, 2008, the Government issued Applicant an \namended SOR, detailing additional security concerns under AG E, Personal Conduct. \nApplicant received the amended SOR on June 27, 2008. She answered the amended \nSOR in writing on July 1, 2008. On November 17, 2008, the Government compiled its \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM). The FORM contained documents identified as Items \n1 through 15.  By letter dated November 17, 2008, DOHA forwarded copy of the FORM \nto Applicant, with instructions to submit any additional information and/or objections \nwithin 30 days of receipt. Applicant received the FORM on November 21, 2008.  Her \nresponse was due on December 21, 2008. She did not file additional information within \nthe required time period. On January 21, 2009, the case was assigned to me for a \ndecision.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains six allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG J, Criminal \nConduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.f.); two allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG \nG, Alcohol Involvement (SOR \u00b6 2.a. and 2.b.); and one allegation of disqualifying \nconduct under AG F, Financial Considerations (SOR \u00b6 3.a.). The amended SOR \ncontains five allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG E, Personal Conduct \n(Amended SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.a(i), 4.a(ii), 4.a(iii), 4.b(i), and 4.c.). In her Answer to the SOR, \ndated May 22, 2008, Applicant admitted all nine allegations. In her Answer to the \nAmended SOR, she denied the five AG E aIlegations. (Item 1; Item 4; Item 5; Item 7.) \n \n \nApplicant is 52 years old, divorced, and employed as an inspector by a federal \ncontractor. She is a high school graduate, and she attended college for about one \nacademic year. Before becoming a government contractor, she served as a military \nreservist for approximately seven years. She has not previously held a security \nclearance.  (Item 8; Item 10.) \n \n \nIn about October 1991, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under \nthe Influence. There is no evidence in the record of the disposition of this charge. \nApproximately three months later, in January 1992, she was arrested and charged \nagain with Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol. In May 1992, she was found guilty of \nthe January 1992 offense. She was fined $1,150, sentenced to 20 days confinement, \nand sentenced to 12 months probation. (Item 9; Item 11.) \n \n \nIn May 1996, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving While License \nSuspended or Revoked.  In June 1996, she was found guilty of the offense and fined \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \n$500. In July 2000, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under the \nInfluence of Alcohol and Driving While License Suspended. In December 2000, she was \nfound guilty on both counts.  She was fined $500 and required to pay court fees.  The \ncourt sentenced her to school and community service.1  She was placed on probation \nfor 11 months and 28 days.  (Item 9; Item 11.) \n \n \nIn February 2004, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under the \nInfluence of Prescribed Medication.  She was found guilty, fined, and sentenced to one \nyear of probation.  On October 31, 2007, Applicant was arrested and charged with \nDriving on a Suspended License, Driving While Intoxicated, and DWI Subsequent \nOffense.  In her May 22, 2008 answer to the SOR, Applicant denied knowing that her \nlicense was suspended when she was arrested on October 31, 2007.  However, in an \naffidavit she signed under penalty of perjury on March 7, 2008, Applicant stated that \nwhen she was arrested on October 31, 2007, \u201c[she]I knew that [her] license was \nsuspended and knew that driving during this time was an arrestable offense.\u201d (Item 9 at \n24; Item 12.)  \n \n \nApplicant continues to drink alcohol.  She estimates that she drinks 4 or 5 cans of \nbeer on weekends. She intends to drink alcohol on occasion in the future.  (Item 10 at 6-\n7.) \n \n \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant admitted she had received \nmedical treatment or counseling due to her use of alcohol. In 2002 or 2003, when she \nwas suffering from depression, she concluded she was drinking too much alcohol. She \nsought medical assistance and was referred to counseling.  A medical doctor prescribed \nantidepressant medication for her, and she met with a counselor every two weeks. \nApplicant thought she was being treated for depression and not alcohol abuse. She is \nno longer under medical care for depression or alcohol abuse. Subsequently, in late \n2007, she took a prescribed medication for anxiety attacks.  (Item 7 at 5; Item 10 at 8.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s automobile was repossessed in either 2003 or 2004. She owes the \ncreditor approximately $17,095 for the remainder owed after the automobile was sold by \nthe creditor. Her credit report of December 2006 shows that the creditor reported the \nunpaid balance of $17,095 as a loss in March 2004. Applicant admitted the debt. She \nhas no plan in place to pay or settle this delinquency. Applicant reports a net monthly \nincome of $1,676 and fixed monthly expenses of $986. Her net monthly remainder is \nprojected to be $283. (Item 4 at 5; Item 10 at 34; Item 15 at 7.) \n \n \nIn response to interrogatories from DOHA, Applicant provided a monthly budget \nwhich showed her plan to pay a total of $406 to nine creditors. Applicant\u2019s credit reports \nof October 19, 2007 and December 13, 2006 revealed she was responsible for seven \nadditional accounts in collection status and one civil judgment. These delinquencies \n \n1 The record does not specify what kind of \u201cschool\u201d Applicant was directed to attend, and it does not \nindicate whether she attended as directed. \n\n \n4 \n \n \ntotaled approximately $4,000 and were not alleged on the SOR.  (Item 10 at 9; Item 14; \nItem 15.) \n \n \nApplicant completed and certified an e-QIP on November 14, 2006.  Question  \n23d on the e-QIP reads as follows: \u201cHave you ever been charged with or convicted of \nany offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?\u201d  In response to Question 23d, Applicant \nanswered \u201cyes\u201d and listed a 2004 arrest for Driving Under the Influence of Prescribed \nMedication. She failed to list or disclose that she had been arrested in October 1991 \nand charged with Driving Under the Influence. She also failed to list or disclose that in \nJanuary 1992 and in July 2000, she had been arrested and charged with Driving Under \nthe Influence of Alcohol.  \n \n \nQuestion 25 on the e-QIP reads: \u201cYour Use of Alcohol: In the last 7 years, has \nyour use of alcoholic beverages (such as liquor, beer, wine) resulted in any alcohol-\nrelated treatment or counseling (such as for alcohol abuse or alcoholism)?\u201d  Applicant \nanswered \u201cno\u201d to Question 25.  She did not disclose that in 2002 or 2003, she sought \nand received medical treatment or counseling because of depression and increased use \nof alcohol. \n \n \nThe SOR allegation at \u00b61.f reads as follows: \u201cOn or about October 31, 2007, you \nwere arrested by [deleted] and charged with Driving on a Suspended License, Driving \nWhile Intoxicated, and DWI Subsequent Offense.\u201d  In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant \nadmitted the allegation at \u00b6 1.f. She then provided the following additional explanation: \n\u201cDefinitely poor judgment on my part. However, I did not know my license was \nsuspended, in the previous offense nothing was said, I realized at that time that it was \nexpired but not suspended.  I have not been charged with this yet . . . . My court date is \n29 May 08.\u201d  Applicant failed to disclose that, according to her affidavit of March 7, \n2008, she knew when she was arrested on October 31, 2007 that her driver\u2019s license \nwas suspended and, further, that she knew it was an arrestable offense to operate a \nmotor vehicle on a suspended license. (Item 4  at 4; Item 9 at 24.) \n \n \nApplicant submitted three letters of character reference.  Her current supervisor \npraised her demeanor and personality and stated that he found her to be \u201cdedicated, \nreliable and trustworthy.\u201d  A co-worker noted her \u201cgood judgment and mature outlook.\u201d  \nThe individual who trained Applicant for her current responsibilities stated he \n\u201cconsistently found [Applicant] to be a conscientious, dutiful and dependable associate.\u201d \n(Item 4, 5-7.)  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    Policies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an  \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \n \nUnder the Criminal Conduct guideline \u201c[c]riminal activity creates doubt about a \nperson\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into \nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d  \nAG \u00b630. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \nApplicant admits a criminal history that spans 16 years. In 1991, 1992, 2000, and \n2007, she was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol.  In 2004, she was \narrested for a drug-related driving offense.  In 1996, 2000, and 2007, she was arrested \nfor three suspended license offenses, two of which occurred when she was also \ncharged with Driving Under the Influence.  This behavior raises concerns under AG \u00b6 \n31(a) and AG \u00b6 31(c).2 \n \n \n \nTwo Criminal Conduct mitigating conditions might apply to Applicant\u2019s case.  If \n\u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d AG \u00b6 32(a) might apply.  If \n\u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage of \ntime without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive involvement,\u201d then AG \u00b6 32(d) \nmight apply. \n \n \n \nThe record demonstrates that Applicant\u2019s criminal behavior, which began in 1991 \nand has continued to at least 2007, is, therefore, recent. A supervisor, co-worker, and \ntrainer provided letters of character reference indicating they thought she was \ntrustworthy and reliable. However, Applicant has not yet established a record of sobriety \nto assure that her long-standing criminal behavior related to alcohol use is unlikely to \nrecur. Her criminal behavior related to her alcohol use continues to cast doubt on her \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  I conclude that neither AG \u00b6 32(a) nor \nAG \u00b6 32 (d) applies. \n \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption, applies in this case to a determination of \neligibility for access to classified information. Under Guideline G, \u201c[e]xcessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to \ncontrol impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability.\u201d \n \n I have considered all of the Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Conditions.  I \nhave especially considered AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c). 3 \n \n \n2 AG \u00b6 31(a) reads as follows: \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d AG \u00b6 31(c) reads: \n\u201dallegation or admission or criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, \nformally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d \n \n3 AG \u00b6  22(a) reads: \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, \nfighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether \nthe individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d  AG \u00b6 22(c) reads: \u201chabitual or \nbinge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d   \n\n \n7 \n \n \nBetween 1991 and at least 2007, Applicant was arrested once for a drug-related \ndriving offense and four times for alcohol-related driving offenses. Her most recent \nalcohol-related driving offense occurred fifteen months ago, in October 2007. She is a \nhabitual consumer of alcohol, and, despite multiple arrests for driving under the \ninfluence of alcohol, she continues to drink alcohol. She sought treatment for \ndepression, following an increase in her alcohol consumption. She is no longer in \ntreatment for depression. Nothing in the record suggests she has been diagnosed as an \nabuser of alcohol or as alcohol dependent. These facts raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c). \n \nThe Guideline G disqualifying conduct could be mitigated under AG \u00b6 23(a) if \n\u201cso much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d The disqualifying \nconduct could also be mitigated under AG \u00b6 23(b) if \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or \nher alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to \novercome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol \ndependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\u201d  If \u201cthe individual is a current \nemployee who is participating in a counseling or treatment program, has no history of \nprevious treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory progress,\u201d then AG \u00b6 23(c) \nmight apply.  Finally, mitigation might be possible under AG \u00b6 23 (d) if \u201cthe individual \nhas successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along \nwith any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of \nmodified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, \nsuch as participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization and \nhas received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a \nlicensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment \nprogram.\u201d  \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related conduct spans at least 16 years, from 1991 to 2007. \nHer most recent arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol occurred in October \n2007 and is therefore recent. In about 2002, she sought treatment for depression, which \nshe believed had caused her to increase her consumption of alcohol. She was treated \nwith an antidepressant, but continued to drink alcohol after her treatment for depression \nended. Despite several arrests for driving under the influence between 1991 and 2007, \nshe has not sought to have her alcohol consumption evaluated by a medical \nprofessional. She continues to drink alcohol. Accordingly, I conclude that none of the \nGuideline G mitigating conditions apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n\n \n8 \n \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated a substantial delinquent debt of over $17,000, \nwhich resulted from the repossession of an automobile.  Since 2004, she has allowed \nthe debt to remain unpaid, and she has failed to make arrangements to satisfy the debt. \nThis evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nGuideline F also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions \ncould apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. \nUnresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if it happened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n(AG \u00b6 20(a)) Additionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol, such as loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. (AG \u00b6 20(b)) Still other mitigating circumstances that might be \napplicable include evidence the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol (AG \u00b6 20(c) or the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts. (AG \u00b6 20 (d))  \n \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquency that dates to at least 2004. Her \ndelinquency is recent, on-going, and occurred under circumstances that are likely to \nrecur. She appears to have income sufficient to pay or settle her delinquent debt over \ntime, but she has failed to do so. The record does not reflect that circumstances beyond \nher control gave rise to her delinquency. I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and \n20(d) do not apply in mitigation to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern: \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \n\n \n9 \n \n \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nWhen Applicant completed and signed her e-QIP in November 2006, she \nresponded \u201cyes\u201d to Question 23, which asked if she had ever been charged with or \nconvicted of any offenses related to alcohol or drugs. She then listed a 2004 arrest for \nDriving Under the Influence of Prescribed Medication. She failed to list a 1991 arrest \nand charge of Driving Under the Influence, a 1992 arrest and charge of Driving Under \nthe Influence of Alcohol, and a 2000 arrest and charge of Driving Under the Influence of \nAlcohol.  In her answer to the amended SOR, she denied that her failure to disclose this \ninformation was deliberate falsification of material facts. \n \n \nQuestion 25 on the e-QIP asked if, in the last seven years, Applicant\u2019s use of \nalcoholic beverages had resulted in any alcohol-related treatment or counseling (such \nas for alcohol abuse or alcoholism). The amended SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s answer \nof \u201cno\u201d was a deliberate falsification of a material fact.  \n \n \nIn her answer to the amended SOR, Applicant stated that she did not know her \nlicense was suspended when she drove her car on October 31, 2007. In her affidavit of \nMarch 7, 2008, Applicant stated she knew on October 31, 2007 that she was driving on \na suspended license. The amended SOR alleged Applicant deliberately falsified \nmaterial facts in her answer to the SOR when she denied knowing her license was \nsuspended.  \n  \nThe allegations in the amended SOR raise a security concern under AG \u00b6 16(a), \nwhich reads: \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used \nto conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or \nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities.\u201d \n \n \n \nSeveral Guideline mitigating conditions might apply to the facts of this case. \nApplicant\u2019s disqualifying personal conduct might be mitigated under AG \u00b6 17(a) if \u201cthe \nindividual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or \nfalsification before being confronted with the facts.\u201d If \u201cthe refusal or failure to cooperate, \nomission, or concealment was caused or significantly contributed to by improper or \ninadequate advice of authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning the security process\u201d and \u201c[u]pon being made aware of \nthe requirement to cooperate or provide information, then individual cooperated fully \nand completely,\u201d then AG \u00b6 17(b) might apply.  If \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much \ntime has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not case doubt on the individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d then AG \u00b6 17(c) might apply. \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d) might apply if \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the behavior and \nobtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \n\n \n10 \n \n \n                                           \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other \ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(e) might apply if \n\u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress.\u201d4   \n \nApplicant denied that her failure to report her 1991, 1992, and 2000 arrests for \nDriving Under the Influence of Alcohol constituted deliberate falsification. However, \nnothing in the record suggests that she took prompt good faith action to correct the \nomissions, concealments or falsifications before she was confronted with the facts. (AG \n\u00b6 17(a).) Nothing in the record suggests that her failure to report the three arrests was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice specifically \nabout the security clearance process from authorized individuals or legal counsel. (AG \u00b6 \n17(b).) Applicant had a sixteen-year record of alcohol-related driving arrests and, as a \nmature adult, she knew those arrests were not minor, so remote in time, so infrequent, \nor occurred under such unique circumstances that they would not seriously impact her \neligibility for a security clearance. (AG 17(c).) Applicant failed to provide documentation \nthat she had acknowledged the behavior that led to the arrests or had taken other \npositive steps to alleviate the circumstances that caused her unreliable conduct and, as \na result such behavior was unlikely to recur (AG \u00b6 17(d).) Nothing in the record \nsuggests that Applicant took positive steps to reduce or eliminate the vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress that her behavior caused. (AG \u00b6 17(e). I conclude, \ntherefore, that it was in her self interest to under-report her arrests for Driving Under the \nInfluence of Alcohol.  I further conclude that her omissions were deliberate. \n \nApplicant also denied on her e-QIP that her use of alcohol had resulted in \nalcohol-related treatment or counseling. However, in response to DOHA interrogatories, \nshe acknowledged she had received treatment for depression and increased alcohol \nuse. She was prescribed antidepressants and saw a counselor. She asserted that she \nthought she was being treated for depression and not alcohol abuse. Absent any other \ninformation on the nature of Applicant\u2019s treatment, her assertion is plausible. \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant stated she did not know her driver\u2019s license \nwas suspended when she was arrested in October 2007.  However, she signed an \naffidavit under penalty of perjury in May 2008 stating that when she was arrested in \nOctober 2007, she knew her license was suspended and that driving with a suspended \nlicense was an arrestable offense. After considering all applicable Guideline E mitigating \nconditions, I conclude that none applies and that Applicant\u2019s answer was a deliberate \nfalsification.    \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \n \n4 Neither AG 17(f) nor AG 17(g) applies to the facts of this case. \n\n \n11 \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult who has \nbeen recognized by her supervisors, trainers, and co-workers as sensible, responsible, \nand trustworthy. However, she failed to accurately report her criminal conduct and her \nalcohol-related behavior on her e-QIP, thereby creating a situation that could seriously \nmislead the government about her honesty, reliability, trustworthiness. Her falsifications \nwere not minor: they went to the heart of her qualifications for a security clearance. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to be truthful was deliberate. She made no effort to correct her \nfalsifications before the government confronted her with her lack of candor. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from her \ncriminal conduct, alcohol involvement, financial delinquencies, and personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.f.: Against Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 4, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 4.a. through 4.c.: Against Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 4.d.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 4.e.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Coacher, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \n \nTUIDER, Robert J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate security concerns regarding Guidelines D (sexual \nbehavior), and E (personal conduct). Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF-86) on \nDecember 14, 2006. On March 8, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuidelines D (sexual behavior), and E (personal conduct). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nSeptember 22, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nThe SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative \nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nor continue a security clearance for Applicant, and it recommended referral to an \nadministrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, \ndenied, or revoked. \n \nOn June 1, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and he elected to \nhave his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the \nfile of relevant material (FORM), dated July 21, 2009, was provided to him, and he was \nafforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, \nor mitigation.1 Applicant submitted information within the 30-day time period after \nreceiving a copy of the FORM. The case was assigned to me on September 2, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated \nherein as findings of fact. I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nBackground Information \n \nApplicant is a 34-year-old software engineer who has been employed by a \ndefense contractor since February 2001.2 He seeks a security clearance in conjunction \nwith his employment.  \n \nApplicant was married to his first wife from November 1997 to August 2001, and \nthat marriage ended by divorce. He has a 12-year-old daughter from his first marriage. \nHe remarried in July 2005. He has a two-year-old daughter from his second marriage, \ndiscussed infra.3  \n \nApplicant attended college from August 1993 to December 1998, and was \nawarded a Bachelor of Science degree. He served in the U.S. Army as an enlisted \nperson from March 1995 to March 2001 in the active reserves, and from March 2001 to \nJuly 2004 in the inactive reserves. \n \nSexual Behavior \n \nApplicant admitted the facts under this concern, which are corroborated by the \ngovernment\u2019s evidence. Applicant had sexual contact with his two sisters from about \n                                                          \n1 DOHA transmittal letter is dated July 21, 2009, and Applicant received the FORM on August 3, \n2009. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 days after receipt to submit \ninformation. \n2 All background information pertaining to the Applicant was derived from his December 2006 SF-\n86, unless otherwise stated. \n \n \n3 Current data regarding children from his second marriage was obtained from Applicant\u2019s \nResponse to FORM. \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n1987, when they were ages 7 to 11, to at least 1989. He became sexually aroused \nwhen his former girlfriend\u2019s six-year-old daughter sat in his lap in about 2001. He \nbecame sexually aroused when his daughter sat in his lap in about 2004. He engaged \nin sexual activity with his first wife without her consent in about 1998. He engaged in \nsexual activity with his first wife in the presence of their infant daughter in about 1998. \nHe placed his daughter\u2019s fingers in his first wife\u2019s vagina while engaging in sexual \nactivity in about 1998.4 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \u2013 1.f.) \n \nApplicant explained, \u201c[m]ost of these events occurred more than 10 years ago.\u201d \nHe stated that he began \u201c[his] professional career in January 1999, prior to that I was \nprimarily a student. From that point I have made every effort to make judgments that \nwould not interfere with my ability to hold employment or maintain my quality of life.\u201d He \nadded that he has \u201cmatured a great deal since graduating college, going through a \ndivorce and raising a child. I am now married a second time and have another child, a \ngirl who is now two years old with another child due in October. Being a parent is a \nposition of trust which my current wife has allowed me with full knowledge of the \nadmitted behaviors/events and based on her observation of my character/person.\u201d5 \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nApplicant admitted the facts under this concern, which are corroborated by the \ngovernment\u2019s evidence. The SOR cross-alleged the conduct described under sexual \nbehavior. (SOR \u00b6 2.a.) Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to Sensitive Compartmented \nInformation (SCI) was denied by another agency in about January 2005. (SOR \u00b6 2.b.) \nThe rationale for the denial was based in large part on the conduct described under \nsexual behavior.6 \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant has sought professional help to deal with any \nof these issues. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nan applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n                                                          \n \n4 Response to SOR, Items 3, 5, and 6. \n \n \n5 Response to FORM. \n \n \n6 Item 6. \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \n \nThe security concern relating to the Guideline for sexual behavior is set out in AG \n\u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or \nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may \nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or \nduress can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness \nand ability to protect classified information. No adverse inference \nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the \nbasis of the sexual orientation of the individual. \n \nThe Guideline delineates four disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 13: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual behavior \nthat the person is unable to stop or that may be symptomatic of a \npersonality disorder; \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion \nor judgment. \n \nThe government established through Applicant\u2019s admissions and evidence \npresented the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \u2013 1.f. Under Guideline D, the evidence \nsupports application of sexual behavior disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a) \u2013 13(d). \n \nThe Guideline delineates four mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 14: \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet. \n \nThe behavior described supra spanned a significant period of time beginning \nwhen Applicant was an adolescent and continued into his adulthood. Applicant did not \npresent evidence sufficient to warrant application of any sexual behavior mitigating \nconditions. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the Guideline for personal conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe Guideline delineates seven disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative; \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of \nsensitive corporate or other government protected information; \n \n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the workplace;  \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's time \nor resources; \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another \ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is \nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a \nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group; \n \n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to \nthe employer as a condition of employment; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity. \n \nThe government established through Applicant\u2019s admissions and evidence \npresented the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. \u2013 2.b. His behavior displays lack of judgment \nand creates a vulnerability to exploitation. Additionally, another government agency has \ndetermined that Applicant\u2019s behavior raises such security concerns that it denied him \naccess to SCI. Under Guideline E, the evidence supports application of personal \nconduct disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) \u2013 16(e). \nThe Guideline delineates seven mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \nI specifically considered all Guideline E Mitigating Conditions and conclude that \nnone apply. Applicant\u2019s conduct spans a significant period of time and there is no \nevidence that he has sought professional help in addressing the conduct described. His \nfavorable information is not sufficient to apply any of the mitigating conditions.  \n \nFor the reasons outlined under the discussions of Guidelines D and E, I conclude \nApplicant\u2019s \nbehavior \nshows \nquestionable \njudgment, \nlack \nof \nreliability, \nand \nuntrustworthiness.  \n \n \nTo conclude, Applicant presented little or no evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the sexual behavior and personal conduct security concerns. Applicant did not \nmeet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In \nreaching this conclusion, I gave due consideration to the whole person concept and that \nanalysis does not support a favorable decision. \n \n  \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d7 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n                                                          \n7 See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

Noel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nOn 17 December 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns raised\nunder Guideline E.  Applicant answered the SOR 9 January 2008, and requested a\n1\nhearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 21 May 2008, and I convened a hearing 17\nJuly 2008. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 25 July 2008. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations, except for SOR 1.b., She is a 45-year-\nold software developer employed by a defense contractor since February 2003. She\nJuly 31, 2008\n\n2\nseeks to retain the security clearance she has held since at least February 1999, when\nshe was employed by a different contractor.\nIn November 2004, Applicant completed a national security form (SF-86) for\naccess to government information at another government agency. She had previously\nhad her security clearance renewed in March 2003. She answered \u201cno\u201d to a question in\nthe form requiring her to report any illegal use of a controlled substance within the last\nseven years. \nIn May 2005, during a polygraph examination with the other government agency,\nApplicant stated that after moving into her new home in April 2004, she discovered a\nbag filled with what appeared to be ecstasy and cocaine above a ceiling tile in the\nbasement. Shortly thereafter, she tried the ecstasy on two occasions. She also put\nsome of the cocaine on her tongue. In June 2005, the other agency disapproved her for\naccess to classified information (G.E. 3). She was advised of her appeal rights.\nOn a February 2006 clearance application, Applicant again answered \u201cno\u201d to a\nquestion requiring her to report any illegal use of a controlled substance within the last\nseven years (G.E. 1). She did report the adverse clearance action taken by the other\nagency. \n \n In a November 2006 unsworn declaration to a government investigator,\nApplicant described her May 2005 polygraph with the other government agency (G.E.\n2). There she is recorded has having stated that she failed her lifestyle polygraph\nbecause of her elusive answers to the drug-related questions. She hired an attorney\nwho specializes in security clearance matters, who arranged for an independent\npolygraph. When the polygrapher opined that the results on the drug questions were\ninconclusive, the attorney advised Applicant not to pursue an appeal with the agency.\nApplicant testified that the attorney was willing to proceed with the appeal, but Applicant\ndecided not to pursue it (Tr. 40). Applicant was not tested on the question of whether\nher claimed drug use was false (Tr. 39).\nIn her October 2007 response to DOHA interrogatories (G.E. 2), Applicant\nprovided a \u201cclarification\u201d of her November 2006 unsworn declaration. She recounted her\npolygraph experience with a harrowing tale, that\u2014if true\u2014would likely constitute\nmisconduct by the polygrapher. She reiterated that experience at hearing. The gist of\nher complaint is that the polygrapher so badgered her during a five-hour polygraph that\nshe made up the story of her drug use to satisfy him. However, she acknowledged that\nthe polygrapher had advised her before the polygraph of her absolute right to terminate\nthe polygraph at any time. She did not do so. She wrote a complaint to the agency\nabout the polygrapher\u2019s conduct. The agency response reiterated her right to appeal the\nclearance decision (Tr. 42-3).\nApplicant\u2019s character reference, who has known her over years, considers her\nreliable and trustworthy (Tr. 45-49). Her supervisor for the last three years rates her an\nabove-average employee. He also considers her reliable and trustworthy. She handles\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n\u00b616 (a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel\n3\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, . . . [or]\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . .; (b) deliberately providing false or misleading\ninformation regarding relevant facts to an . . . investigator . . .;\n3\nstress well, is not known to be a pushover in work-related conversations, and has never\nlost control of a situation (Tr. 54-55). \nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline E, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant either falsified clearance\nforms in November 2004 and February 2006, or she deliberately lied to a polygrapher in\nMay 2005.  Thus, the burden of persuasion shifted to Applicant to refute or mitigate the\n3\ngovernment\u2019s information.\n\n4\nApplicant faces numerous hurdles in proving her version of her polygraph\nexamination in May 2005. While it is relatively easy to allege polygrapher misconduct, it\nis extremely difficult to prove it. It is difficult to believe Applicant would invent a lie about\ndrug use (creating adverse information) just to get the polygrapher to stop the alleged\nbadgering, especially where she knew she was free to terminate the polygraph at any\ntime. She did not terminate the polygraph, and offered no explanation why she didn\u2019t if\nshe felt she was being so abused. \nIn addition, there are two reported versions of Applicant\u2019s polygraph experience,\nthe November 2006 summary of Applicant\u2019s unsworn declaration to the government\ninvestigator and Applicant\u2019s October 2007 sworn \u201cclarification,\u201d substantially repeated at\nhearing. It is impossible to know if the investigator\u2019s summary accurately relates the gist\nof what Applicant said, or merely reflects the investigator\u2019s distillation of what Applicant\nsaid. What is clear is that the first clear allegation of polygrapher misconduct appears in\nOctober 2007. Finally, although Applicant complained about the polygrapher\u2019s conduct,\nand went so far as to retain counsel to examine her appeal options, by her own\nadmission her independent polygraph was inconclusive on the drug questions and she\nwas not tested on the truth of her claim that she made up the drug use she reported to\nthe polygrapher. Ultimately, Applicant chose to not pursue an appeal. It matters not\nwhether that decision was recommended by her counsel, or was hers alone.\nApplicant finds herself in a difficult position, but it is a position largely of her own\nmaking. The best case view of the facts in this case has Applicant lying to the\npolygrapher in a misguided attempt to get access to the other agency\u2019s information. The\ngovernment met its burden of establishing doubts about Applicant\u2019s veracity and her\nultimate fitness for access to classified information. I need not decide which of the SOR\nallegations is actually true. I need only conclude that Applicant has not met her burden\nof demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue her\naccess to classified information. I resolve Guideline E against Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

His eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF-86) on February 27, \n2007. On June 19, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior, Guideline E, Personal Conduct, and Guideline M, Use of \nTechnology Systems. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nNovember 25, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \n \nOn August 11, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and, at a later time, \nafter reviewing the investigative record compiled in his case, elected to have a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on October 2, 2008. I \nconvened a hearing on October 29, 2008, to consider whether it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The \nGovernment called no witnesses and introduced two exhibits, which were marked Ex. 1 \nand Ex. 2 and admitted to the record without objection.  Applicant testified on his own \nbehalf, called one witness, and introduced one exhibit, which was marked Ex. A.  \nApplicant\u2019s Ex. A was admitted to the record without objection.     \n \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on November 6, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains eight allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG D, Sexual \nBehavior (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.h.), two allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG E, \nPersonal Conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. and 2.b.), and one allegation under AG M, Use of \nInformation Technology Systems (SOR \u00b6 3.a.). In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant \nadmitted three allegations under AG D and one allegation under AG E. He denied six \nallegations under AG D, one allegation under AG E, and one allegation under AG M. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions are admitted herein as findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is 45 years old and employed by a government contractor. He \ngraduated from a military college with a bachelor\u2019s degree in civil engineering, and he \nserved on active duty in the military from 1985 to 1992.

Since returning to civilian life in 1992, Applicant has \nbeen employed by six government contractors.1 (Ex. 1; Ex. 2; Tr. 27-29, 33-35.) \n \n \nApplicant was married in 1985.  He and his wife are the parents of four daughters \nand three sons. Applicant\u2019s oldest child is 21 years old; his youngest child is four years \nold. Applicant\u2019s wife filed for divorce in July 2008. (Ex. 1; Tr. 63-64, 68.)  \n \n \nSince adolescence, Applicant has battled a strong and repetitive desire to access \nand view pornography. While he denies he is addicted, Applicant has regularly \naccessed pornography at home and in his workplaces for over 20 years. He considers \nviewing pornography to be sinful and morally wrong. He has stated: \u201cI realize I will \nalways be tempted to view pornography as it has been an ongoing battle my entire life.\u201d \n(Tr. 65-66; Ex. 2 at 14.) \n \n \n1Applicant was employed by federal contractor X from October 2001 to August 2004.  He returned to \nwork for federal contractor X in July 2007. Federal contractor X is the sponsor of his current request for a \nsecurity clearance. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nSince becoming committed to his faith in 1986, he has sought support and \ncounsel from fellow members of his church and from his pastors in addressing his \nattraction to and use of pornography. In an affidavit he signed in January 2008, he \nstated he had never gone outside of his faith community for help with his pornography \nproblem.  He told an authorized investigator in January 2008 that he would be open to \nseeking professional psychological counseling for his problem with the repetitive use of \npornography. As of the date of his ISCR hearing, he had not taken any action to seek \noutside professional help. While at his hearing he repeated his openness to seeking \ntreatment, he also stated that, on his own, he had successfully changed the behavior \nwhich led him to seek pornography.  (Ex. 2; Tr. 45-52.) \n \n \nApplicant searched for and viewed pornographic images on his official work \ncomputers when employed by four separate government contractors during the periods \nfrom 1992 to 1996, 1996 to 1999, 2001 to 2004, and 2005 to 2007.  Applicant knew his \nemployers had policies prohibiting the use of office computers to access pornography. \nHe also knew that by using his workplace computers to access and view pornography, \nhe was violating his employers\u2019 policies and his agreements to abide by those policies.  \nHe preferred to access and view pornography at work because he feared discovery by \nhis wife or children if he used pornography at home. When he elected to access and \nview pornographic images and movies in the workplace, he took steps to hide his \nbehavior from his employers. If he had a private office, he stayed late and viewed \npornography after regular work hours. He also stated that after viewing pornography, he \ninvolved himself with masturbation in his office or in a workplace bathroom. Applicant \ndid not tell his employers about his use of pornography in the workplace because he \nfeared losing his job and other possible adverse consequences. (Ex. 2 at 5, 8; Tr. 54-\n58.)  \n \n \nIn August 2004, Applicant accepted a position with a government contractor.  \nThe position required that he hold a security clearance and be granted eligibility for \naccess to SCI. As a part of his background investigation, Applicant underwent a \npolygraph examination conducted by another federal agency. From the facts that \nApplicant provided on the polygraph, the other agency denied his request for a security \nclearance and access to SCI because it concluded that his use of pornography included \nsearching for and viewing pornographic images of underage females. Applicant denied \nactively seeking or using child pornography. He stated he sought and used only adult \nheterosexual pornography. He acknowledged that he had no way of knowing or \nverifying the ages of the females whose pornographic images he had viewed over the \ncourse of many years.  He also stated that he was attracted to and considered \npornography involving teen-aged girls to be legal pornography.  (Ex. 2 at 6; Tr. 61-63.) \n \n \nIn May 2005, after being denied the security status requested by the employer, \nApplicant moved to another job with a different government contractor. He stated he \ninformed his supervisor at his new job that he had been denied a security clearance \nbecause he had misused his former employers\u2019 information technology systems. He \nalso stated he told his new employer\u2019s security officer that he had lost his clearance \nbecause he had viewed pornography. During this employment, Applicant accessed and \n\n \n4 \n \n \nviewed pornography on his employer\u2019s information technology systems. Applicant was \nlaid off by this employer in May 2007. He stated that he had last accessed and viewed \npornography on an employer\u2019s workplace computer in February 2007. (Ex. 2 at 1-2, 4-8; \nTr. 20, 52-59.)    \n \n \n \nSometime after being laid off, Applicant accepted a position with a government \ncontractor he had worked for previously. In January 2008, after providing an affidavit to \nan authorized investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), \nApplicant asked his employer\u2019s security officer to monitor his compliance with the \ncompany\u2019s computer security requirements. The employer\u2019s manager for security and \nsafety monitored Applicant\u2019s compliance from January 10, 2008 to October 22, 2008 \nand found Applicant to be in compliance with company security requirements. Applicant \ndenies ever using his employers\u2019 classified computers or classified networks to access \nand view pornography.  (Ex. 2 at 8; Ex. A.) \n \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife and his three oldest children know of his personal battles with \npornography. Applicant\u2019s wife also knows that he used his employers\u2019 information \ntechnology systems to access and view pornography and that these actions have \ncaused him to lose access to classified information. Applicant has a personal computer \nin his home which he uses to access and view pornography. In 2004, Applicant had a \npornography monitoring program installed on his personal computer. The monitoring \nsystem was designed to block pornography so that Applicant could not access or view \nit. The monitoring program remained on Applicant\u2019s personal computer for \napproximately 1\u00bd years. During that time, Applicant figured out how to bypass the \nmonitoring system and access and view pornography without anyone knowing.  (Ex. 2 \nat 9, 13-14; Tr. 69-70.) \n \n \nIn the summer of 2007, Applicant again had a pornography monitoring program \ninstalled on his personal computer. This program was designed to monitor Applicant\u2019s  \ninternet browsing and report the results to two people selected by him.  Applicant used \nthis program for several months.  He then removed it from his computer because he \nsaid it caused his computer to \u201crun slowly and block some functions I needed to perform \non it.\u201d  In January 2008, after his interview with an authorized investigator, he reinstalled \nthe program again on his computer. (Ex. 2 at 13, 17.) \n \n \nIn the last six months Applicant has viewed pornographic images about three \ntimes. In addition to computer searches for pornography, he also rents pay-per-view \npornographic movies monthly. In an attempt to control his viewing of pornographic \nmovies, Applicant has tasked his 21-year-old son with holding the PIN number \nauthorizing access to pay-for-view pornography.  (Ex. 2 at 13; Tr. 65-68.) \n \n \nApplicant and his wife are separated, and his wife has filed for divorce.  Applicant \naccuses his wife of an extra-marital same-sex relationship.  He hopes to reconcile with \nhis wife. In the event the couple does not reconcile and Applicant\u2019s wife is granted a \ndivorce, Applicant intends to sue for custody of their minor children. (Tr. 74-78.) \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s pastor, who has known him for over 15 years, testified about his \nefforts and those of other church members to help Applicant overcome his attraction to \nand compulsive use of pornography.  (Tr. 84-99.) \n \n    \n                                                           Policies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                           \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \n \n \nAG \u00b612 identifies the government\u2019s concern with Guideline D, in pertinent part, \nas follows:  \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or \nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may \nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or \nduress can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness \nand ability to protect classified information \n \nWhile he denies an addiction to pornography, Applicant, who is now 45 years old \nand the father of seven children, acknowledges that, since adolescence, he has battled \na compulsive desire to access and view pornographic material. Because the record \ndoes not contain a medical diagnosis of sexual addiction, I conclude SOR \u00b6 1.b. for \nApplicant. Applicant made an affirmative choice over a period of twenty years to seek \nhelp from his church community in controlling his desire to view pornography. That the \nhelp failed to permanently change or mitigate his behavior does not negate his efforts.  I \nalso conclude SOR \u00b6 1.c. for Applicant. \n \nFor at least four protracted periods of time, between 1992 and 2007, his strong \nand repetitive desire to view pornography caused him to use his employers\u2019 information \ntechnology systems to access and view pornography. Applicant vigorously denied that \nhe sought or used child pornography, but did not deny he had accessed and viewed \npornography involving teen-aged girls because he considered pornography involving \nteen-aged girls to be legal pornography and found it impossible to determine with \naccuracy whether the individuals on the pornographic images he viewed were adults. \nApplicant\u2019s behavior in viewing pornographic images in the workplace as a government \ncontractor reflected lack of discretion and judgment and made him vulnerable to the \npossibility of coercion, exploitation and duress. I conclude that his sexual behavior \nraises security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(b), 13(c), and 13(d).2 \n \nAn applicant might be able to mitigate Guideline D security concerns. If the   \nsexual \u201cbehavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no evidence of \nsubsequent conduct of a similar nature,\u201d then AG \u00b6 14 (a) might apply. If \u201cthe sexual \n \n2 AG \u00b6 13(b) reads: \u201ca pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual behavior that the person \nis unable to stop or that may be symptomatic of a personality disorder.\u201d AG \u00b6 13(c) reads: \u201csexual \nbehavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress.\u201d  AG \u00b6 13(d) \nreads: \u201csexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion or judgment.\u201d  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nbehavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such unusual circumstances, \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d then AG \u00b6 14(b) might apply.  If \u201cthe behavior no \nlonger serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d the AG \u00b6 14(c) might \napply.  Finally, if \u201cthe sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet,\u201d then \nAG \u00b614 (d) might apply. Applicant was an adult when he carried out the sexual behavior \nthat raises security concerns. He denied his behavior could be defined as a sexual \naddiction, and he did not seek an evaluation of his sexual behavior from a qualified \nprofessional counselor. His sexual behavior was indiscreet and reflected poor \njudgment. It was repetitive and involved taking high risks that made him vulnerable to \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. I conclude that none of the Guideline D mitigating \nconditions apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case.   \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n \nUnder the Personal Conduct guideline \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable \njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide \ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to \ncooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d  AG \u00b6 15 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s high risk sexual behavior was in contravention of the security policies \nof his government contractor employers.  He purposefully concealed his access and use \nof pornography in the workplace from his employers because he knew he might lose his \njob if his behavior was discovered. He also betrayed the trust of his family, church \ncommunity, and those who sought to counsel and support him in overcoming his \ncompulsive use of pornography when he disabled computer monitoring controls \nintended to block his access to pornography. I have carefully considered all of the \nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying conditions. I have especially considered AG \u00b6 16(e), \nwhich reads as follows: \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) \nengaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or \ncommunity standing . . . .\u201d  \n \n \nDuring his military and civilian careers, Applicant was awarded a security \nclearance. He then engaged in high risk sexual behavior that he kept secret and did not \nreport to his security officers, making him vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress. His compulsive use of pornography in the workplace, if known, would have \naffected his personal, professional, and community standing because it raised issues of \ntrustworthiness and reliability.  Accordingly, I conclude that AG \u00b616(e)(1) is raised by the \nfacts of Appellant\u2019s case. \n  \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s disqualifying personal conduct might be mitigated if he \u201cmade prompt, \ngood-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being \nconfronted with the facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(a) Additionally, Applicant\u2019s disqualifying conduct \n\n \n8 \n \n \nmight be mitigated if he \u201chas taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress.\u201d  AG  \u00b6 17(e) \n \n \n \nApplicant did not make prompt good faith efforts to correct his concealment.  He \nhas not addressed whether he has a sexual addiction that would lead future high-risk \nsexual behavior and a similar pattern of concealment.  I conclude that neither AG \u00b6 \n17(a) nor AG \u00b6 17(e) applies to the facts of Appellant\u2019s case. \n \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology Systems \n \nAG \u00b6 39 identifies the Government\u2019s concern under the Use of Information \nTechnology Systems  adjudicative guideline: \n \nNoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \nand information.  Information Technology Systems include all related \ncomputer hardware, software, firmware, and data used for the \ncommunication, transmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or \nprotection of information. \n \n \nFor more than 20 years, Applicant used his employers\u2019 computers to access and \nview pornographic materials. His actions contravened his employers\u2019 policies as \ngovernment contractors and raised security concerns about Applicant\u2019s willingness or \nability to put the Government\u2019s interest in protecting classified information ahead of his \nown desires.  Applicant\u2019s behavior raises a security concern under AG \u00b6 40(e), which \nreads: \u201cunauthorized use of a government or other information technology system.\u201d \n \nThree possible mitigating conditions could apply to security concerns arising \nunder AG \u00b6 40.  If \u201cso much time has elapsed the behavior happened, or it happened \nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d then AG \u00b6 41(a) might \napply.  If \u201cthe misuse was minor and done only in the interest of organizational \nefficiency and effectiveness, such as letting another person use one\u2019s password or \ncomputer when no other timely alternative was readily available,\u201d then AG \u00b6 41(b) might \napply.  Finally, if \u201cthe conduct was unintentional and inadvertent and was followed by a \nprompt, good-faith effort to correct the situation and by notification of supervisor,\u201d then \nAG \u00b6 41(c) is applicable. \n \nApplicant\u2019s misuse of his employers\u2019 information technology systems was neither \nminor nor justified in the interest of organizational efficiency and effectiveness. \nApplicant\u2019s last admitted misuse of an employer\u2019s information technology system to \naccess pornography occurred in February 2007. When viewed in light of Applicant\u2019s 20 \nyears of secretive and deliberate misuse, insufficient time has elapsed to conclude that \nApplicant is now reliable and trustworthy and will not likely misuse a government \n\n \n9 \n \n \nemployer\u2019s information technology system again to access pornography.  Accordingly, I \nconclude that none of the mitigating conditions identified under AG \u00b6 41 apply to the \nfact of Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Over a period encompassing1992 to \n1996, 1996 to 1999, 2001 to 2004, and 2005 to 2007, Applicant violated the security \npolicies of four different government contractors by accessing and viewing pornography \non information technology systems owned by his employers and used for their work as \ngovernment contractors. He kept his actions secret from his employers. He deceived his \nfamily and those in his church community who sought to help him control his compulsive \ndesire to access and view pornography. While he asserted he would seek professional \ncounseling for his compulsive behavior, he failed to do so and averred he had \nsuccessfully resolved the problem on his own. He failed to mitigate serious concerns \nabout his credibility, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to put the government\u2019s \ninterests before his own in the protection of classified information.  AG \u00b6 2(a)(7). \n  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his sexual \nbehavior, personal conduct, and use of information technology systems. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph  1.a:   \n           Against Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline M:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations contained in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b of the SOR, and offered explanations in support of his request for eligibility for a security clearance. His admissions are incorporated into the following findings: Applicant is a 52-year-old married man, who is an interactive courseware designer for a defense contractor. He is part of the senior management team. (Tr. 45). Prior to working for a federal contractor, he had a successful career in the broadcasting field for over 17 years. In 1998, he began working with a federal contractor that merged with his current employer in August 2006. In December 2006, he submitted an e-QIP. In response to Section 24: Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity on the e- QIP, Applicant disclosed his history of illegal drug use. In November 1972, Applicant began using marijuana two to three times a week, while in college. He continued purchasing and using it with that frequency until November 2006, a month or so prior to completing his e-QIP. Before submitting the e-QIP, Applicant met with his general manager and direct supervisor.

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Gregory L. Ryan, Esquire \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nDAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access \nto classified information is denied. \n \nOn December 12, 2006, Applicant submitted his Security Clearance Application \n(e-QIP). On January 14, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline H (Drug Involvement). The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 5, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. On March 11, 2008, DOHA assigned the case \nMay 30, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nto me. A Notice of Hearing was issued on April 9, 2008, and the case was heard on \nApril 30, 2008, as scheduled. Department Counsel offered Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 into \nevidence without objection. Applicant testified, called two witnesses, and offered \nExhibits (AE) A through I into evidence without objection. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on May 9, 2008.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations contained in \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b of the SOR, and offered explanations in support of his request for \neligibility for a security clearance. His admissions are incorporated into the following \nfindings: \n \n \nApplicant is a 52-year-old married man, who is an interactive courseware \ndesigner for a defense contractor. He is part of the senior management team. (Tr. 45). \nPrior to working for a federal contractor, he had a successful career in the broadcasting \nfield for over 17 years. In 1998, he began working with a federal contractor that merged \nwith his current employer in August 2006. In December 2006, he submitted an e-QIP. \n \n \nIn response to Section 24: Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity on the e-\nQIP, Applicant disclosed his history of illegal drug use. In November 1972, Applicant \nbegan using marijuana two to three times a week, while in college. He continued \npurchasing and using it with that frequency until November 2006, a month or so prior to \ncompleting his e-QIP.   \n \n \nBefore submitting the e-QIP, Applicant met with his general manager and direct \nsupervisor. He informed them of his history of using marijuana and of his intention to \ndisclose it to the Government, because he did not intend to lie to them or the \nGovernment. He believes that making those disclosures was a positive step in his life \nand furthered his decision to stop using marijuana. (Tr. 43). He is committed to \nmaintaining abstinence and signed a statement of his intention not to use any illegal \ndrugs in the future. (AE I). He acknowledged that one of the reasons he stopped using \nmarijuana related to the adverse consequence it could have on his employment. (Tr. \n72).     \n \n \nIn April 2008, Applicant voluntarily made an appointment with a professional \nclinical counselor, who has a specialty in substance abuse, for a drug assessment. After \na one-hour interview with Applicant, which included a random drug screening (that was \nnegative), a discussion of Applicant\u2019s reported substance abuse pattern, and a review of \ninformation pertaining to specific reason for the assessment referral, viz., the security \nclearance process, the counselor concluded that there were no symptoms of drug \nabuse or dependence. She determined he did not need, and thus did not recommend, \nparticipation in any form of rehabilitation. (AE G). Subsequently, he did not seek any \nadditional professional assistance or participate in any formal substance abuse \ntreatment or 12-Step program.  \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nFor the last 35 years, Applicant used marijuana recreationally with old friends \nand at home for purposes of relaxing. (Tr. 53-55; 69). After deciding to stop using it, he \ninformed his friends of his decision.  Although he no longer smokes marijuana, some of \nhis old school friends continue to use it. Within the past week of this hearing, he went \nfishing with a group of those friends, who continue to smoke marijuana and did so in his \npresence. (Tr. 62-63). \n \n \nWhile testifying Applicant, credibly and candidly, acknowledged that his long \nhistory of smoking marijuana, an illegal activity, demonstrated poor judgment. (Tr.59). In \nretrospect, he regrets having used it for such a long period of time. (Tr. 78). He has no \nintention of using it in the future. (Tr. 42). \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s direct supervisor testified. He is an instructional designer and has a \nSecret security clearance. He has known Applicant since 1988 and worked with him in \nprevious capacities. He has supervised Applicant for the last two years. He is aware of \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana history. (Tr. 30; 35). He considers Applicant to be a very reliable \nand trustworthy. (Tr. 31). \n \n \nOne of Applicant\u2019s previous colleagues from a radio station testified. She met \nApplicant in 1984 while they were news reporters, and subsequently became the news \ndirector and his supervisor. They worked together about ten years, and maintained their \nfriendship for 24 years. Over the course of the years that she has known Applicant, she \nhas been impressed with his strong adherence to the principle of maintaining \nconfidentiality of sources in journalistic reporting. She does not have any reason to be \nconcerned about Applicant\u2019s ability to keep government secrets. (Tr. 21). \n \n \n \nFive of Applicant\u2019s friends and colleagues submitted letters in support of \nApplicant, attesting to his reliability, integrity and trustworthiness. Several of them have \nknown him for many years. (AE A, B, C, D and E). His current manager, who has known \nhim for nine years, commented on Applicant\u2019s strong sense of honesty and professional \ncharacter. (AE F). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n\n \n4 \n \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement:  \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and \ninclude: \n \n(1) drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in \nthe Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or \ncannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(2) inhalants and other similar substances; \n \n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a \nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 sets forth conditions that could raise a drug involvement security \nconcern and be disqualifying. They include: \n \n(a) any drug abuse (see above definition);  \n \n(b) testing positive for illegal drug use; \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug abuse or drug dependence; \n \n(e) evaluation of drug abuse or drug dependence by a licensed clinical \nsocial worker who is a staff member of a recognized drug treatment \nprogram; \n \n(f) failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed by \na duly qualified medical professional; \n \n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance; and \n \n(h) expressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and \nconvincingly commit to discontinue drug use. \n \nApplicant admitted that he purchased and used marijuana from November 1972 \nuntil November 2006. That evidence established facts that raise security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 25(a) and AG \u00b6 25(c).    \n \nAfter the Government raised a security concern, the burden shifted to Applicant \nto rebut or produce evidence that could mitigate the security concerns raised by his \ndrug involvement. AG \u00b6 26 provides the following mitigating conditions: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \n  \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for \nany violation; \n \n (c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nAfter considering the evidence in the record, only one of the four mitigating \nconditions applies to this case, viz., AG \u00b6 26(b)(4). AG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply because \nApplicant used marijuana recreationally for 35 years, with his last use occurring less \nthan two years ago. Hence, his behavior was recent and frequent, casting doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment.  \nAG \u00b6 26(b)(1) and (2) do not apply because Applicant continues to associate with \nfriends with whom he previously used marijuana and in environments where he knows \nthey may use marijuana, including within a week of this hearing. Applicant\u2019s assertion of \ntwo years of abstinence is not sufficient to trigger the application of AG \u00b6 26(b)(3), given \nhis long history of using marijuana. AG \u00b6 26(b)(4) provides some mitigation. Applicant \nsigned a statement of intent authorizing an automatic revocation of a clearance should it \nbe determined that he uses marijuana in the future. This action demonstrated a \ncommitment to abstain from drug use in the future. \nThe record evidence does not support the application of AG \u00b6 26(c) or AG \u00b6 26 \n(d). Applicant began using marijuana for recreational purposes and not as an authorized \nmedical prescription. He did not complete a prescribed drug treatment program as \ncontemplated under the guidelines. \nIn addition to the normal concerns under Guideline H, at issue here is whether \nApplicant is disqualified, as a matter of law, from security clearance eligibility due to his \nillegal drug use. The pertinent law is now 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435c, which provides, in relevant \npart, as follows: \u201cAfter January 1, 2008, the head of a Federal agency may not grant or \nrenew a security clearance for a covered person who is an unlawful user of a controlled \nsubstance or an addict\u201d as defined by federal law. This prohibition uses language that is \nnearly identical to the previous prohibition in 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986.1  \n                                                          \nIndent 1 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c) (2) (2008) (\u201cThe person is an unlawful user of, or is addicted to, a controlled \nsubstance\u201d as defined by federal law.). \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAs a starting point, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435c applies to Applicant because he is an \nemployee of a federal contractor.2 Second, there is no evidence to prove that Applicant \nis an addict. Third, there is ample evidence to prove that Applicant was an unlawful user \nof a controlled substance, as the record evidence shows that Applicant smoked \nmarijuana on a fairly regular basis for 35 years and did so until November 2006. But, \nthere is insufficient evidence to prove that Applicant is currently an unlawful user. \n(Emphasis added). \nThe statutory prohibition in 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435c(b), like its predecessor in 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 986(c)(2), uses the present tense, not the past tense. A plain-meaning reading of the \nstatute cannot be stretched to apply Applicant\u2019s marijuana use that took place about 19 \nmonths ago in November 2006. To read it otherwise would result in a mandatory \ndisqualification of a person who engaged in drug abuse three years ago or perhaps at \nany time in the past, a result inconsistent with the plain meaning of the statute. This \ninterpretation of 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435c(b) is consistent with Appeal Board case law from \n2003 and 2005 when it interpreted 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c) (2) in the same way.3  Hence, the \ncurrent federal statute pertaining to substance abuse does not apply to this case. \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nfollowing nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must include an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n                                                          \n2 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435(a) (2) (defining a covered person under the statute). \n \n3 See ISCR Case No. 03-25009 (App. Bd. Jun. 28, 2005) (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c)(2) uses the present \ntense, not the past tense, when referring to unlawful use of, or addiction to, controlled substances, \nconsequently, the Administrative Judge erred by concluding that Congress intended that persons who \nhad been addicted to, or dependent on, controlled substances in the past to be forever barred from being \ngranted a clearance); ISCR Case No. 01-20314 (App. Bd. Sep. 29, 2003) (Administrative Judge erred by \napplying  10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c)(2) to an applicant who last used marijuana about two years before the \nhearing). \n\n \n8 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, including Applicant\u2019s candid \ntestimony. Applicant is an intelligent and successful 52-year-old man, who has worked \nfor his employer for more than ten years and has received the support of many \ncolleagues and professionals.   \n \nApplicant began purchasing and using marijuana frequently in November 1972 \nand continued to use it until November 2006, which included time while working for the \nfederal government. After initiating the security clearance process, he realized that it \nwas time to stop. He subsequently, openly and honestly, discussed his drug history with \nhis employer and some colleagues. He went for a drug assessment, albeit not with a \nhealth care provider recognized under the AGs, or one who performed a standard \nprotocol of psychological testing and extensive interviews. These steps represent \nevidence of his decision to change his life. However, his history of frequent marijuana \nabuse spans more than thirty-five years and indicates an extensive pattern of exercising \npoor judgment. His evidence of abstinence spans two years, and primarily consists of \nhis assertions, one drug screening, and a drug assessment that can be given little \nweight, all of which is insufficient to offset his history. \n \n Clearly, Applicant has had a \u201cblind spot\u201d regarding his drug use for 35 years, \nwhich he acknowledges. He continues to associate with friends who use illegal drugs \nand is present when they use them. This shows a continuing course of poor judgment, \nviolations of the law, and inability to extricate himself from the overall illegal drug \nculture. While he appears sincerely dedicated to abstinence, he has not established a \nsufficient track record of rehabilitation and good judgment, corroborated by independent \nand professional evidence, to persuade me that he has sufficiently addressed the \nunderlying issues related to his long-term marijuana use. There is no evidence of other \nmisconduct or adverse information in his record. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant did \nnot mitigate the security concerns arising under drug involvement. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly not consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Those\n4\nfavorable findings are not at issue on appeal.\n2\nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On March 14, 2008, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge LeRoy F. Foreman denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in concluding\nApplicant\u2019s falsification of her security clearance application was deliberate; whether the Judge\u2019s\nunfavorable clearance decision under Guideline F is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\n(1) Applicant argues that she did not deliberately falsify her response to two questions on her\nsecurity clearance application by failing to disclose multiple debts that had been delinquent for more\nthan 90 or 180 days.  At the hearing she stated that she failed to disclose the information because she\nwas under stress and misunderstood the \u201cfull impact\u201d of the questions.   In her appeal brief, she\n1\nstates only: \u201cIn the present case there were no intentional misstatements on the application.\u201d2\nApplicant has not demonstrated that the Judge erred.\nThe Judge had the opportunity to consider Applicant\u2019s explanation for why she failed to\ndisclose the information in question.   The Judge was not bound, as a matter of law, to accept or\n3\nreject Applicant\u2019s explanation.  The Judge considered Applicant\u2019s explanation in light of the record\nevidence as a whole, and concluded there was a sufficient basis to find that Applicant\u2019s omissions\nwere deliberate and intentional.  On this record, the Judge\u2019s finding of deliberate falsification is\nsustainable.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  His ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under\nGuidelines E is also sustainable.\n \n(2) Applicant also argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the\ndebts alleged in the SOR were her husband\u2019s debts, not hers.   In the alternative, she argues that the\n4\nJudge should have concluded that the security concerns raised by her history of financial difficulties\nhad been mitigated because the indebtedness had resulted from circumstances beyond her control,\nshe had received counseling and there were clear indications that her financial problems were being\nresolved, and that she had made a good-faith effort to repay the creditors.  Given the totality of the\nrecord evidence, Applicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\nA Judge\u2019s findings must be supported by substantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as\na reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary\n\nApplicant admitted to the debts in SOR paragraphs 1(b), 1(d), 1(g) and 1(i) in her Answer.  At the hearing she\n5\nacknowledged: \u201cYes, I have debts.\u201d  Transcript at 42.  Credit reports admitted without objection established that\nApplicant was individually responsible for the debts in SOR paragraphs 1(b), 1(d), 1(e) and 1(f).  See Government\nExhibit 4 (which lists accounts as \u201cINDIV ACC\u201d or \u201cJOINT ACC\u201d).  Similarly, the two judgments reflected on the credit\nreports as pertaining to SOR paragraphs 1(g) and 1(i) name Applicant as a defendant.  See Government Exhibits 3 and\n4.  In his decision, the Judge noted that: \u201cSome of the delinquencies are in the name of Applicant\u2019s spouse, but they affect\nthe entire family, making Applicant vulnerable to pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress.\u201d  Decision at 10.\n3\nevidence in the record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the\nevidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not\nprevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo\nv. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  Considering the record as a whole, the\nJudge\u2019s material findings as to Applicant\u2019s debts are supported by substantial evidence and are\nsustainable.5\nOnce a concern has been articulated regarding an applicant\u2019s security eligibility, there is a\nstrong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish mitigation.\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply\non a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application\nrequires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See ISCR Case\nNo. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2003).  \u201cThus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does\nnot alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.\u201d  See ISCR Case No.\n05-02833 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar.19, 2007).  \u201cAs the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence\nas a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice\nversa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue\nfor a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d  See\nISCR Case No. 05-03143 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006).\nApplicant has not met her burden of demonstrating that the Judge erred in concluding that\nthe Guideline F allegations had not been mitigated.  Although Applicant strongly disagrees with the\nJudge\u2019s conclusions, she has not established that those conclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.  \nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a history of not meeting financial obligations\nthat extended over many years.  At the time the case was submitted for decision she still had\nsignificant outstanding debts and was still in the process of trying to resolve her financial problems.\nIn light of the foregoing, the Judge could reasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems\nwere recent and still ongoing.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2005).  The Board does not review a case de novo.  After\nreviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\n\n4\na satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Borgstrom, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on May 10, 2005.  \nOn September 27, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny her \napplication, citing security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and \nE (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 2, 2007; answered it on \nNovember 13, 2007; and requested a decision on the record without a hearing. On \nDecember 7, 2007, Department Counsel requested a hearing.  Department Counsel \nwas ready to proceed on January 2, 2008, and the case was assigned to me on that \ndate. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 8, 2008, and I convened the hearing \nas scheduled on January 29, 2008. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5 were \nMarch 14, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf, and she \nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through E, which were admitted without objection. \nI granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until February 15, 2008, to enable \nher to submit additional evidence. Applicant timely submitted AX F through R by \nfacsimile transmission, and they were admitted without objection.  Original copies of AX \nG through R subsequently were received by mail and substituted for the facsimile \ncopies. (AX F was a facsimile cover sheet and was not included in the submission by \nmail.) Department Counsel\u2019s response to AX G through R is attached to the record as \nHearing Exhibit (HX) I.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 7, \n2008. The record closed on February 15, 2007. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nCounsel for Applicant \n \n \nAt the hearing Applicant stated she had an attorney assisting her with her \nfinancial problems. She stated her attorney was not able to attend the hearing but was \navailable by telephone for consultation (Tr. 4). Her attorney had not filed a notice of \nappearance with DOHA regarding the hearing. I explained that the hearing would not go \nforward over her objection, and I asked her if she desired to proceed without her \nattorney present. She responded in the affirmative (Tr. 5-6).  Based on her affirmative \nwaiver, I conducted the hearing with her attorney absent but available for consultation \nby telephone. Applicant submitted AX A, a narrative statement prepared by her attorney \n(Tr. 39). Her attorney prepared and submitted her post-hearing evidence (AX F through \nR). \n \nAmendment of SOR \n \n \nOn Department Counsel\u2019s motion, without objection from Applicant, I permitted \namendment of SOR \u00b6 2.a by substituting the word and figure \u201cQuestion 38\u201d in place of \n\u201cQuestion 28,\u201d and amendment of SOR \u00b6 2.b by substituting the word and figure \n\u201cQuestion 39\u201d in place of \u201cQuestion 29\u201d (Tr. 21-22). \n \nPost-hearing Submission \n \nOn February 20, 2008, I received a copy of a two-page letter addressed to \nDepartment Counsel from Applicant\u2019s attorney. I declined to consider this letter, \nattached to the record as HX II, because it was untimely and not addressed to me.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, \n1.g, 1.h, and 1.i.  Her admissions in her answer to the SOR and at the hearing are \nincorporated in my findings of fact.  I make the following findings: \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant is a 50-year-old administrative assistant employed by a federal \ncontractor.  She has worked for her current employer since May 2005.  She has never \nheld a clearance.   \n \n \nFor the appraisal period ending in August 2006, Applicant was rated as 3.5 on a \n5-point scale.  This rating placed her midway between a 3-point rating (met all \nrequirements and expectations) and a 4-point rating (frequently exceeded requirements \nand expectations) (AX D).  Her rating for the period ending in July 2007 was a 3.7 on \nthe same scale (AX E). \n \n \nApplicant was married in April 1983 and divorced in September 1988.  She \nmarried her current spouse in October 1991.  She has a 15-year-old daughter and a 10-\nyear-old son from her current marriage (Tr. 49). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse was a salesman for a telephone communications company. \nAfter the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, his company downsized and he lost \nhis job (Tr. 43, 49). Her spouse is in poor health, with heart problems and severe spinal \narthritis. He suffered a stroke last year (Tr. 43). He is now employed with a home \nappraisal company (Tr. 50). \n \n \nApplicant was employed by an insurance company from December 1987 to \nNovember 2003 (GX 1 at 2).  She was laid off and unemployed until June 2004, when \nshe began working at a golf club.  After seven months, she was laid off from the golf \nclub job and was unemployed for about three and a half months.  She began her current \njob in May 2005 (Tr. 51-52). \n \n \nAs a result of their unemployment, Applicant and her spouse accumulated \nnumerous delinquent debts. The SOR alleges six delinquent debts and three unsatisfied \njudgments totaling about $33,147. In the summer of 2003, they consulted an attorney \nabout their financial situation, and they considered filing for bankruptcy (GX 5 at 2; Tr. \n52-53, 58).  After working with the attorney for about two years, they decided they could \nnot afford to pay the fees involved in a bankruptcy (Tr. 59).   \n \n \nWhile considering bankruptcy and trying to save enough money to pay the fees, \nApplicant\u2019s spouse contacted several creditors, attempting to resolve their debts.  He \nwas unsuccessful, and they hired their current attorney about 18 months ago (Tr. 59).  \nTheir current attorney challenged several debts and negotiated settlements of the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.h. \n \n \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel announced that his investigation of the \ncharge account debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a revealed that Applicant was an \u201cauthorized \nuser\u201d of the account but not legally obligated to pay it. Accordingly, Department Counsel \nannounced that the government would not pursue SOR \u00b6 1.a and asked that it be \nresolved in Applicant\u2019s favor (Tr. 23). \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant stopped making payments on the credit card accounts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.f shortly after her spouse lost his job. In July 2007, Applicant\u2019s spouse \nentered into a stipulation of settlement of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, providing for \nmonthly payments of $50 (AX M), and Applicant produced evidence of two payments \n(AX B; Tr. 64)). They had not made any payments on the other credit card accounts as \nof the date of the hearing (Tr. 62). \n \n \nJudgments were entered against Applicant in April 2005 and February 2006 for \nthe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g. and 1.i.  No payments have been made on these \njudgments. \n \n \nA judgment was entered against Applicant in August 2005 for the debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.h.  Applicant entered into a stipulation of settlement for this debt providing for \npayments of $100 per month (AX C).  She testified she started making payments in \nSeptember or October 2007, but she produced no documentary evidence of payments \n(Tr. 70). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s post-hearing submission reflects lawsuits arising from delinquent \ndebts that were filed against Applicant\u2019s spouse for $3,513 in January 2007 (AX R), \n$2,202 in February 2007 (AX P), and $5,220 in July 2007 (AX Q).  These lawsuits are \nnot alleged in the SOR, and the record does not show the disposition of these cases.   \n \n \nThe evidence concerning the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR is summarized \nin the table below. \n \nSOR Debt \nAmount Status \nEvidence \n1.a \nCredit card $2,008 \nNot Applicant\u2019s debt \nTr. 23 \n1.b \nCredit card $4,916 \nUnpaid \nGX 2 at 2; GX 4 at 4; Tr. 62 \n1.c \nCredit card $2,490 \nMaking payments \nGX 4; AX B; AX M; Tr. 64 \n1.d \nCredit card $5,375 \nUnpaid \nGX 2 at 2; GX 3 at 2; GX 4 at 5 \n1.e \nCredit card $2,255 \nUnpaid \nGX 2 at 2; GX 3 at 2; GX 4 at 5 \n1.f \nCredit card $10,122 Unpaid \nGX 2 at 2; GX 3 at 1; GX 4 at 4 \n1.g \nJudgment \n$2,218 \nUnpaid \nGX 2 at 2; GX 3 at 1; GX 4 at 3 \n1.h \nJudgment \n$6,886 \nMaking payments \nGX 2 at 2; GX 3 at 1; AX C \n1.i \nJudgment \n$2,877 \nUnpaid \nGX 2 at 2; GX 3 at 1 \n \n \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in February 2006, she \nhad a net monthly salary of $2,140, monthly household expenses of $1,150, and a \nmortgage payment of $1,100.  She was making no credit card payments, and she had a \nmonthly shortfall of about $110. Her spouse was unemployed. Her mother provided \nfinancial assistance to cover the monthly shortfall (GX 5 at 2).   \n \nAt the time of the hearing, Applicant\u2019s spouse had returned to work and was \ntaking home between $1,500 and $2,000 each month.  In addition to other household \nexpenses, they were paying about $200 per month for heating oil, and their mortgage \n\n \n5 \n \n \npayment had increased to about $1,200. They still receive occasional financial \nassistance from her mother (Tr. 79-80). \n \n \nWhen Applicant executed her security clearance application (SF 86) on May 10, \n2005, she answered \u201cno\u201d to question 38, asking if she had been more than 180 days \ndelinquent during the past seven years, and \u201cno\u201d to question 39, asking if she was \ncurrently more than 90 days delinquent on any debt.  She did not disclose the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f. \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR and at the hearing, Applicant denied falsifying her SF \n86.  She testified \u201cI think the built up pressure of trying to keep the family together, \nstarting a new job, sorting all this out, husband ill, my mother was ill at the time, I just \nthink I didn\u2019t read it correctly.\u201d  She testified knew she had delinquent debts, and knew \nshe had been working with a lawyer to resolve them (Tr. 73-74). She also testified she \nthought that old debts were \u201ckind of like just washed\u201d and no longer valid (Tr. 75). She \ntestified she might have omitted the debts because she thought the question applied to \ndebts like mortgage, but not credit card debts and the debts being handled by her \nlawyer (Tr. 75-76).   \n \n \nApplicant testified she was not worried about not getting a job when she filled out \nher SF 86 because she already had the job (Tr. 77-78).  She did not remember being \ntold she needed a security clearance for the job, and she thought the SF 86 was \u201cjust \nsomething that had to be done,\u201d like the insurance forms and other paperwork (Tr. 78). \n \n \nApplicant testified as follows about her desire to have a clearance: \n \n \nFor me, to have a government clearance, for lack of a better word, would \nbe like a dream come true. My father had one. He had a career with [a \nfederal contractor], he was very proud of that. I remember as little girl \nhearing, my mother said that investigators were in the neighborhood \ntalking to the neighbors to see what kind of family man my father was. So \nwhen I got this job . . . I felt he\u2019d be very proud of me. \n \n(Tr. 44-45.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to Guideline F is set out in AG & 18 as follows: \n \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \n \nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case.  AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an \nAinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.@ AG \u00b6 19(b) is a two-pronged condition that is \nraised where there is Aindebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and \nthe absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a \nrealistic plan to pay the debt.@  AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there is Aa history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.@  AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised when there is Aconsistent spending \nbeyond one=s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.@  \nApplicant\u2019s financial history raises AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (e).  AG \u00b6 19(b) is not raised \nbecause there is no evidence of frivolous or irresponsible spending. \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (e), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).   \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@  AG \u00b6 20(a).  This is a compound \nmitigating condition, with three disjunctive prongs and one conjunctive prong.  It may be \nestablished by showing the conduct was Aso long ago,@ or Aso infrequent,@ or Aoccurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.@  If any of the three disjunctive \nprongs are established, the mitigating condition is not fully established unless the \nconduct Adoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.\u201d \n \n \nThe first prong (\u201cso long ago\u201d) is not established because Applicant\u2019s delinquent \ndebts are not yet resolved. The second prong (\u201cso infrequent\u201d) is not established \n\n \n8 \n \n \nbecause she has numerous delinquent debts. The third prong (\u201cunlikely to recur\u201d) also is \nnot established because Applicant is still financially overextended and has not resolved \nmany of her delinquent debts.  I conclude AG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@ AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the \npersons=s control and responsible conduct, must be established. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s unemployment, her spouse\u2019s unemployment, and her spouse\u2019s illness \nwere conditions beyond her control.  She and her spouse acted responsibly, contacting \ncreditors and seeking legal advice.  They have successfully negotiated payment plans \nfor the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.h.  I conclude AG \u00b6 20(b) is established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.@  AG \u00b6 20(c).  This \nmitigating condition also has two prongs that may be either disjunctive or conjunctive.  If \nthe person has received counseling, it must also be shown that there are clear \nindications the problem is being resolved or under control.  However, if the person has \nnot received counseling, this mitigating condition may still apply if there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or under control. \n \nApplicant and her spouse are receiving legal advice and assistance, but many \ndebts are still unresolved and their financial situation is still not under control.  I \nconclude AG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.@ AG \u00b6 20(d). The concept of good faith Arequires a showing that a person acts in \na way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or \nobligation.@  ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).  \nEvidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of debts only under \npressure of qualifying for a security clearance.   \n \n \nApplicant and her spouse lack the financial resources to resolve all their debts, \nbut they have made good faith efforts to do so. They began their efforts in the summer \nof 2003, long before Applicant applied for a clearance.  I conclude AG \u00b6 20(d) is \nestablished. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition in this case is \u201cdeliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d  AG \u00b6 16(a). \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the government \nhas the burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove an applicant\u2019s \nstate of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the \nrecord evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial \nevidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. See ISCR \nCase No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining holding in ISCR Case No. \n02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).   \n \nApplicant presented herself at the hearing as intelligent and articulate, but she \ngave conflicting explanations for answering the two financial questions in the negative. \nShe was unable to articulate a plausible explanation for not disclosing her financial \nsituation. The remainder of her SF 86 was meticulously and accurately executed. It was \nclear from her testimony she regarded a security clearance as a coveted badge of \nhonor. I cannot determine whether she omitted the financial information because of \nembarrassment, a reluctance to explain a complicated situation, or fear that it would \njeopardize her application for a clearance. I believe Applicant did not fully appreciate the \ngravity of her deliberate omission of relevant and material information on her SF 86. I \nam satisfied, however, that Applicant understood the questions, was aware of her \nnumerous delinquent debts, and deliberately chose not to disclose them. Accordingly, I \nconclude the disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 16(a) is raised, shifting the burden to \nApplicant to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by false or misleading answers on a security clearance \napplication may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith \nefforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with \nthe facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(a). There is no evidence Applicant made any effort to correct her \nanswers to questions 38 and 39 until she was interviewed by a security investigator in \nFebruary 2006 and confronted with the evidence of her delinquent debts.  I conclude \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigating by showing \u201cthe \noffense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  AG \u00b6 17(c).  \nApplicant\u2019s intentional omission of relevant and material information from her SF 86 was \na felony, not a minor transgression.  It involved her current application for a clearance.  \nIt is the only instance of its kind in her record.  It does raise doubt, however, about her \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment.  I conclude AG \u00b6 17(c) is not established.  No \nother enumerated mitigating conditions under this guideline are established. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant has endured financial setbacks and family illness. She and her \nhusband have tried for several years to overcome their burden of delinquent debt. They \nremain financially overextended and have no viable plan to get out of debt.  Further \ndelinquencies are likely to occur. Some of the delinquencies are in the name of \nApplicant\u2019s spouse, but they affect the entire family, making Applicant vulnerable to \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress. \n \n \nThe three delinquent debts reflected in AX P, Q, and R are not alleged in the \nSOR, and they may not be considered as independent grounds to deny a clearance.  \nHowever, conduct not alleged in the SOR may be considered: (a) to assess an \napplicant=s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant=s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, \nor changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated \nsuccessful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative \nGuidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for the whole person analysis. ISCR \n\n \n11 \n \n \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (citations omitted).  I have considered \nAX P, Q, and R for the limited purpose of evaluating Applicant\u2019s overall financial \nsituation. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and \nE, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations and \npersonal conduct. Accordingly, I conclude she has not carried her burden of showing \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nLeRoy F.
