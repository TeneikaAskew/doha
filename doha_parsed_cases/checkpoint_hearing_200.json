(Government Exhibit 1.) On October 17, 2017, the \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline F \n(Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \n \n\n \n \n \n2 \n \n \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nAdjudicative Guidelines effective within the Department of Defense after June 8, 2017. \n  \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on December 7, 2017, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared \nto proceed on January 30, 2018. The case was assigned to me on February 6, 2018. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on March 8, \n2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 30, 2018.  \n \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 4, which were admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits A through DD, which were admitted \nwithout objection, and testified on his own behalf. DOHA received the transcript of this \nhearing on May 8, 2018. The record then closed.  \n  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 48 years old and employed by a defense contractor. He is married for \nthe second time, and has three children. Applicant is seeking to retain a security clearance \nin connection with his employment.   \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \n \n \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, \nuntrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant owed approximately $54,000 in past-due \nindebtedness to various creditors. Applicant denied owing the debt in SOR allegation 1.c. \nApplicant partially admitted and partially denied the remaining allegations. The existence \nand amount of the debts is supported by admissions of Applicant, and credit reports \nsubmitted by the Government dated October 6, 2015; and August 24, 2017. (Government \nExhibits 4 and 3.) Applicant submitted credit reports dated November 16, 2017; \nNovember 25, 2017; and two different reports each dated April 12, 2018. (Applicant \nExhibits K, B, P, and Q.)  \n \n \nApplicant was married to his first wife from 1988 through 2013. From 2010 to 2012 \nApplicant was stationed in a combat zone, and was making a substantial monthly income. \nHe believed his wife was taking care of the family finances, but she was not. He had to \npay this wife substantial spousal support after their divorce, because of his income at that \ntime. This began his financial difficulties. Applicant was able to reduce his spousal support \nto a more manageable amount in July 2017. (Tr. 24-30; Applicant Exhibits F and G.)  \n \n\n \n \n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant moved to Germany in 2012, and married his second wife in August 2014. \nHis wife and her son moved to Germany, but she did not work there. (Tr. 31, 35; \nGovernment Exhibit 1 at Section 17.) \n \n \nApplicant was stricken with a case of bacterial meningitis in March 2015. He was \nhospitalized for over a month, and was in a coma for approximately three weeks. He was \noff work for approximately three months. During that time he was only earning 65% of his \nnormal pay. This increased his already serious financial issues. (Tr. 32-38, 67-71; \nApplicant Exhibit L.)  \n \n \nApplicant returned to the United States in December 2016. He began trying to \nresolve his past-due indebtedness starting in 2017. (Tr. 73-77.)  \n \n \nThe current status of the debts is as follows:  \n \n \n1.a. Applicant admitted that he owed approximately $12,970 to a credit union for a \ncharged-off debt. SOR allegations 1.b and 1.d relate to different debts with the same \ncredit union. He reached a payment agreement with this credit union in August 2017, and \nhas been consistently making monthly payments in accordance with this agreement, as \nis shown by documents from the credit union. This debt is being resolved. (Applicant \nExhibits N and U; Tr. 38-42, 77-83.) \n \n \n1.b. Applicant admitted that he owed $11,579 to a credit union for a charged-off \ndebt. He reached a payment agreement with this credit union in August 2017, and has \nbeen consistently making monthly payments in accordance with this agreement, as is \nshown by documents from the credit union. This debt is being resolved. (Applicant \nExhibits N and U; Tr. 38-42, 77-83.) \n \n \n \n1.c. Applicant denied that he owed $10,215 for a charged-off debt on a department \nstore credit card. Applicant disputed this debt, stating that the account belonged to his \nmother. Applicant further stated that he was an authorized user on the account, but he \ndid not incur the debts. Records from the creditor confirm that Applicant\u2019s mother is the \naccount holder. Applicant\u2019s mother submitted a notarized letter stating that Applicant was \nnot responsible for the debt. Finally, Applicant has disputed the debt in writing with the \ncreditor. Based on the available information, I find that insufficient evidence has been \nsubmitted to show that this is actually Applicant\u2019s debt. It is in dispute. (Applicant Exhibits \nBB, CC, and DD; Tr. 49-55, 83-85.) \n \n \n1.d. Applicant admitted that he owed $8,085 to a credit union for a charged-off \ndebt. He reached a payment agreement with this credit union in August 2017, and has \nbeen consistently making monthly payments in accordance with this agreement as shown \nby documents from the credit union. This debt is being resolved. (Applicant Exhibits N \nand U; Tr. 38-42, 77-83.) \n\n \n \n \n4 \n \n \n \n1.e. Applicant admitted that he owed another credit union $777 for a charged-off \ndebt. He submitted documentary evidence showing that he paid this debt in full. It has \nbeen resolved. (Applicant Exhibits J, P at 25, Q at 44-46; Tr. 42-45.) \n \n \n1.f. Applicant admitted owing a delinquent medical bill in the amount of $376. He \nhas paid this debt in full, as shown by documentation from the creditor\u2019s collection agent. \nThis debt is resolved. (Government Exhibit 15 at 3; Applicant Exhibit H at 4-5; Tr. 45-46.) \n \n \n1.g. Applicant admitted that he owed $10,914 for a charged-off personal loan. \nApplicant made a payment arrangement with the creditor\u2019s collection agent, and \nsubmitted documentation from the collection agent that showed he has been in \ncompliance with that arrangement. This debt is being resolved. (Applicant Exhibits H, M, \nW, and X; Tr. 46-49.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current financial situation is stable. His wife is employed, and they are \nable to pay their current indebtedness with no trouble. Applicant has taken credit \ncounseling courses. He also submitted documentation showing that he is current on other \nformerly delinquent accounts not discussed in the SOR. Applicant understands the \nimportance of resolving his past-due debts and remaining fiscally secure into the future. \n(Applicant Exhibits C, D, T, V, Y, Z, and AA; Tr. 55-64, 85-87.)  \n \nMitigation \n \n \nApplicant provided nine letters of recommendation from people who know him in \nthe defense industry, both military members and civilians. He is described as a man of \ncharacter, a person who is trustworthy, and a valued professional. They all recommend \nhim for a position of trust. (Applicant Exhibits A and R.)  \n \n \nApplicant served in the Air Force from 1992 to 2001. He received an Honorable \nDischarge at the end of his military service. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section 15.) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \n\n \n \n \n5 \n \n \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \n \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n\n \n \n \n6 \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant had approximately $54,000 in past-due debts that he had not paid or \nresolved as of the time the SOR was issued. These facts establish prima facie support \nfor the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate \nthose concerns. \n \n \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant has paid or otherwise resolved the debts in the SOR. The financial \nsituation occurred because of malfeasance by his ex-wife, Applicant having to pay an \nexcessive amount of spousal support related to his income, and Applicant suffering from \na serious health issue that kept him out of work for three months. His current financial \n\n \n \n \n7 \n \n \nstatus is stable, and he evinces a credible intent and ability to maintain that stability into \nthe future. Applicant has the knowledge and ability that will allow him to stay on a proper \nfinancial footing. He has fully mitigated all the allegations in the SOR. Paragraph 1 is \nfound for Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for a national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant=s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.    \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has mitigated the \nconcerns regarding his financial situation. He did not knowingly or voluntarily create the \ndelinquencies, and acted responsibly to resolve them. He has minimized the potential for \npressure, coercion, or duress, as well as the likelihood of recurrence. Overall, the record \nevidence does not create substantial doubt as to Applicant=s present suitability for national \nsecurity eligibility, and a security clearance. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by & E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.g:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n\n \n \n \n8 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant=s national security \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n                                                \n \n \n \n \nWILFORD H. ROSS \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Petcher, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant\u2019s second mortgage and two credit-card accounts were charged off for \nnonpayment. Some small medical debts and a car insurance debt were placed for \ncollection. More progress is needed toward addressing his delinquencies. Personal \nconduct concerns because of alleged deliberate falsification were not established. \nClearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 28, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, and Guideline E, personal conduct. \nThe SOR explained why the DOD CAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF \ntook the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \n10/24/2018\n\n2 \n \nAccess to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective \nwithin the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant submitted an initial response to the SOR on November 15, 2017, in which \nhe answered the SOR allegations and requested a hearing before an administrative judge \nfrom the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). At the request of the DOD CAF, \non December 13, 2017, he clarified his response to the Guideline E allegation (SOR \u00b6 2.a). \nOn April 18, 2018, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine whether \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. On April 24, 2018, I scheduled a hearing for May 17, 2018. \n \nAt the hearing, three Government exhibits (GEs 1-3) were admitted. A January 3, \n2018 letter forwarding the proposed GEs to Applicant and a list of the GEs were marked as \nhearing exhibits (HEs I-II) for the record but not admitted in evidence. Nineteen Applicant \nexhibits (AEs A-S) were admitted in evidence, and Applicant testified, as reflected in a \ntranscript (Tr.) received on June 8, 2018. \n \nI held the record open, initially to June 16, 2018, for post-hearing submissions from \nApplicant. On June 11, 2018, Applicant requested an extension of the deadline (AE T), and \nhe submitted a character reference letter, which was admitted in evidence (AE U) without \nobjection. I extended the deadline to June 29, 2018, and two exhibits (AEs V-W) were \ntimely submitted and entered into evidence. On July 11, 2018, Applicant submitted a \npersonal statement. Because the case was still pending a decision because of my \nworkload, I re-opened the record for comment by the Government by July 27, 2018. On \nJuly 23, 2018, Department Counsel indicated that the Government had no objection. I \nadmitted the statement as AE X. On August 15, 2018, Applicant requested that I consider \nemail correspondence (AE Y) between him and the DOD CAF. On August 16, 2018, I \nadvised the parties that I would accept the correspondence in evidence, subject to any \nobjections, but that the record was closed for additional documents. Department Counsel \ndid not file any objection, and I admitted the exhibit in the record. \n \nSummary of SOR Allegations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of September 28, 2017, Applicant owed \n$24,496 on a charged-off mortgage account (SOR \u00b6 1.a); charged-off credit-card balances \ntotaling $15,378 on three accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d); $173 in past-due debt on a federal \nstudent loan for $10,162 (SOR \u00b6 1.e); a $231 insurance debt in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.f); and \nfour medical collection debts totaling $194 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g-1.j).  Under Guideline E, Applicant \nallegedly falsified an October 2016 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) by responding negatively to financial record inquiries concerning delinquency \ninvolving routine accounts (SOR \u00b6 2.a). \n \n \nWhen Applicant answered the allegations, he denied the mortgage delinquency \nbecause he did not recognize the creditor as a lender with whom he ever had a mortgage. \nHe admitted the credit card debts, but explained that he was only an authorized user on his \nspouse\u2019s account in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($5,698). Applicant admitted that he had previously been \n\n3 \n \nlate on his student loan payments, but his loan was brought current three months ago. He \nasserted that he has a zero balance on the insurance debt (SOR \u00b6 1.f); that he settled the \n$93 (SOR \u00b6 1.g) and $25 (SOR \u00b6 1.j) medical collection debts; and that he was \ninvestigating two $38 medical collection debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i). Applicant denied that \nhe had deliberately falsified his e-QIP. He explained that he was given one night to \ncomplete the form when he was away from home on training and that he had advised \nonsite personnel he did not have the information available to complete the form. (Answer.) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old high school graduate who has worked as a uniformed \nprotection officer for his employer, a defense contractor, since October 2016. He was \nemployed as a county correctional officer from March 1997 to August 2016. Applicant and \nhis spouse have been married since July 2000, and they have three children, ages 16, 14, \nand 9. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 79.) Their children have some medical issues. (Tr. 72.)  \n \nApplicant and his spouse purchased their current residence in July 2006, acquiring \nan adjustable-rate mortgage loan for $256,500. Applicant recalls that the initial mortgage \npayments were only $1,300 a month. (GE 3; Tr. 88-90.) In May 2007, they obtained a \nsecond mortgage for $24,496 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) to pay for household repairs and appliances. \n(GEs 2-3; AE R; Tr. 89.) In October 2007, the monthly obligation on their primary mortgage \nincreased from $2,028 to $2,694. (AE O.) Applicant was unable to refinance for a fixed-rate \nmortgage at that time because his home was worth less than the mortgage debt. (Tr. 92.) \nIn the fall of 2008, their mortgage payment decreased to $2,512. (AE O.) Applicant and his \nspouse struggled to make that mortgage payment. At times, they relied on the credit cards \nin SOR \u00b6 1.c and \u00b6 1.d to cover some of their mortgage payment. (Tr. 94-95, 109.) \n \nOver the next few years, Applicant and his spouse were late in paying some bills. \nThey stopping paying on some accounts, including their second mortgage. In January \n2010, they obtained a car loan for $14,736. They were chronically late, from 30 to 90 days, \nin making their $297 car payment. Applicant worked overtime when he could, and he held \na second job as a security guard at a high school 16 hours a week from July 2012 to June \n2014, but they still struggled to pay their bills. (GEs 2-3; Tr. 96.) \n \n \nApplicant was recognized for his professionalism and teamwork as a county \ncorrectional officer, including in April 2016. (AE I.) However, he went 12 years without a \nraise, and earned only $21 an hour after 20 years on the job. (Tr. 80, 96.) In August 2016, \nhe lost his job after he submitted an inaccurate claim for hours worked, which he maintains \nwas due to a clerical error. (GE 2; Tr. 68.) While unemployed and without health insurance, \nApplicant incurred out-of-pocket prescription costs of $630 in September 2016 for his son. \n(Tr. 84-87.) \n \n\n4 \n \n \nApplicant had \u201cprobably $80,000\u201d in his retirement contributions disbursed to him \nwhen he was terminated from his job as a corrections officer. (Tr. 117, 120.) Within six \nmonths, he spent $40,000 to $41,000 of the funds on cars for himself and his spouse. (Tr. \n120-121.) The remainder went to catch up on their primary mortgage and other living \nexpenses, including electric and gas debts of approximately $2,000 each. They were so \ndelinquent on their gas bill that the meter was removed from their house, and the company \nwould not accept installment payments. (Tr. 121-123.) \n \n \nIn mid-October 2016, Applicant was hired by his current employer, pending the \ngovernment\u2019s approval of his assignment to its contract with the company. (GE 2.) He was \nsent for one month of training in another state. He was advised to bring proof of citizenship, \na valid social security card, and valid photo identification acceptable for federal \nidentification. He was not told to bring all the information that he might need to complete an \naccurate e-QIP. (AE D.) He was advised that no controlled substances could be used \nduring the training, so he discontinued his prescription medications for his attention deficit \nhyperactivity disorder (ADHD).  (AE X; Tr. 72.) \n \n \nApplicant reported for training on October 24, 2016. The next day, he was advised \nthat he needed to complete an e-QIP, and he received an email with the information \nneeded to access the form electronically. (AE D.) Applicant expressed some concern to \nanother trainee that he did not have the information available to accurately complete the \nform. He was instructed to do the best that he could. He felt stressed and unprepared to \ncomplete the task, but he completed the form in the hotel lobby that night. (AE X; Tr. 63-\n64.) He responded negatively to the e-QIP\u2019s financial record inquiries concerning \ndelinquency involving routine accounts, including whether he had any bills or debts turned \nover to a collection agency in the last seven years and whether he had any account or \ncredit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled in the last seven years for failing to pay as \nagreed. (GE 1.) \n \n \nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit in late January 2017 showed charged-off balances of \n$24,496 on his second mortgage and $5,752, $5,698, and $4,108 on three consumer-\ncredit accounts. Some smaller debts were reportedly in collection. A car loan obtained in \nJanuary 2010 was $692 past due on a $720 balance. (GE 3.) Applicant denies that he had \nany intention to conceal his financial delinquencies, citing the lack of notice and information \navailable at the time to complete the form accurately. The training classmate, to whom \nApplicant had confided his concerns about the form, indicates that Applicant lacked \nadequate time and opportunity to complete the form. (AE G.) \n \n \nOn May 17, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). When asked about any financial issues, he \nresponded \u201cYes\u201d to whether he had a credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled and \nto being over 120 days delinquent on a credit card because of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He \nexplained that he fell behind on the debt when his mortgage payment increased and that \nhe had no success in working out a payment plan with the credit lender. He asserted that \nhe paid down the debt to $3,500 through a collection entity. Applicant denied that he had \nany additional delinquencies or financial problems. He was then confronted about the other \n\n5 \n \ndebts on his credit record.1 He recognized the credit card debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d and \nhis student loan, which he maintained was deferred. He did not recognize the medical \ncollection debts, and explained that his spouse handles the bills. Applicant explained that \nhe had not previously disclosed the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d due to error; the student \nloan because it was deferred; and the credit-card debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c because he was only \nan authorized user on his spouse\u2019s account. Regarding his second mortgage (SOR \u00b6 1.a), \nApplicant denied there was any problem because he combined it with his primary mortgage \nwhen he refinanced. Applicant described his financial situation as good in that he was \npaying his bills on time. He attributed the delinquencies to the financial strain caused by the \nincrease in his monthly mortgage obligation. Applicant expressed his intention to \ninvestigate the adverse credit information on his record and pay his debts. (GE 2.) \n \n \nOn May 25, 2017, Applicant was re-interviewed to provide documentation about his \nfinancial accounts, which showed that the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.c had obtained a financial \njudgment against his spouse. The court determined on April 6, 2017, that she had no \npresent ability to repay the $5,843 balance. He provided documentation showing that Trans \nUnion had deleted the mortgage debt (SOR \u00b6 1.a) from his credit report. He asserted to the \ninvestigator that the debt was paid. He presented documentation showing that he had \nrequested a financial hardship deferment of his federal student loan on February 16. 2017, \nand asserted that it was not delinquent. Applicant had requests pending with Trans Union \nto report the status of the account in SOR \u00b6 1.b as closed and to verify the balance of the \ncredit-card account in SOR \u00b6 1.d. Regarding the medical collection accounts, Applicant \nexplained that his spouse paid their medical bills. Applicant expressed his intention to \ninquire about the accounts discussed and pay them. (GE 2.) \n \n \nAvailable evidence reflects the following delinquency and payment histories for the \nSOR debts: \n \nCharged-off mortgage loan for $24,496 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \n \n \nApplicant and his spouse\u2019s second mortgage has been delinquent since May 2010. \n(AE R.)  Their account was charged off for $28,019 in February 2011, but they then made \nmonthly payments from $200 to $250 through July 2012. A last payment of $100 in \nSeptember 2012 reduced the balance to $24,496. (GE 3; AE E.) Applicant indicated during \nhis May 2017 interview with the OPM investigator that he made monthly payments of $225 \non the loan until approximately 2008, when he combined the debt with his primary \nmortgage in a refinancing. Around 2011, Applicant noticed the charged-off second \nmortgage on his credit report and disputed the debt. (GE 2.) Trans Union removed the \ncredit entry with the original lender from his credit profile in February 2013. (AE E.) \nAvailable evidence shows that the debt had been transferred, so it is likely that the original \nlender could not verify the debt. \n \n \nAs of January 2017, the creditor now holding the debt (SOR \u00b6 1.a) was reporting a \ncharged-off balance of $24,496. (GE 3.) In May 2017, Applicant told the OPM investigator \n                                                 \n1 Applicant testified that he did not recall some debts until they were brought up by the investigator. (Tr. 78.) \n \n\n6 \n \nthat he contacted the creditor, who billed him for the debt, and that he was advised to \nsubmit loan documents proving the debt was either paid or combined with his primary \nmortgage. He told the investigator that he intended to send the loan documents to the \ncreditor. (GE 2.) The creditor billed him every month, including in September 2017 (AE R), \nfor the principal balance of $24,496 on the loan. (Tr. 100.) In late November 2017, \nApplicant disputed the debt with the creditor. (AE R.) The creditor proved to him that it \nlegitimately held the debt, so Applicant is no longer disputing it. (Tr. 55-56; 99.) Sometime \nduring the second week of May 2018, Applicant applied to his primary mortgage lender to \nmodify his loan to include this debt. Action on his application is pending an appraisal on his \nhome. If he is denied, he intends to repay the charged-off second mortgage at $150 a \nmonth. (Tr. 56-58, 101.) \n \nCharged-off credit account for $5,572 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) \n \n \nApplicant and his spouse opened a joint credit account in August 2008 with a \n$5,000 credit limit for dental work. (GE 3; Tr. 102-103.) He paid on the debt until July 2011, \nand in October 2011, the creditor charged off the account for $5,752. As of January 2017, \nall three credit reporting agencies were reporting a balance of $5,752 ($969 past due). (GE \n3.) He indicated during his May 2017 subject interview that, after being contacted by a \ncollection entity, he began repaying the debt at $50 to $100 a month. He could not recall \nthe date on which he began making payments, but he believed the debt had been paid \ndown from $5,752 to $3,500. (GE 2.) Applicant contacted the creditor after he received the \nSOR, but the account had been removed from collections. (Tr. 103-104.) In early January \n2018, Applicant and his spouse asked the creditor to contact them about resolving the \ndebt. (AE N.) As of mid-May 2018, they were still awaiting repayment terms from the \ncreditor. (AE H; Tr. 58-59, 103.) Applicant presented no recent credit information that could \ncorroborate the reduced balance of $3,500. High credit on the account is reported to have \nbeen $3,826. \n \nCharged-off credit card for $5,698 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) \n \n \nApplicant was an authorized user on his spouse\u2019s credit-card account opened in \nFebruary 2000. They used the credit card for groceries and medicine. (Tr. 59.) The creditor \ncharged off a balance of $5,698 because of nonpayment after October 2013. In October \n2015, the creditor was awarded a judgment of $5,484 against Applicant\u2019s spouse. (Tr. \n105.) Applicant indicates that they heard nothing further about the debt until January 2017, \nwhen his spouse was summoned to court to answer for nonpayment of the judgment. (AE \nQ.) The court determined in April 2017 that his spouse did not then have the financial \nmeans to pay the debt because she had no income apart from social security disability \nincome (SSDI). Applicant testified that he initially agreed to make $25 payments on the \ndebt but did not make those payments. (Tr. 105.) In December 2017, Applicant entered \ninto an agreement in court to pay the accrued judgment balance of $5,906 for his spouse \nat $50 a month starting in mid-January 2018. (AE Q; Tr. 59-60.) Applicant began repaying \nthe debt in April 2018. He had made two payments as of late May 2018. (Tr. 61, 106.) He \nadmits that he did not make the payments required from January through March 2018. \nWhen asked for his reason, he responded that he \u201cjust didn\u2019t get to pay it.\u201d He then added \n\n7 \n \nthat his basement had been flooded with sewage around that time and in late March or \nearly May 2018, he had water damage in his house from a burst water pipe. (Tr. 107.) \n \nCharged-off credit card for $4,108 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) \n \n \nApplicant and his spouse opened a joint credit-card account in August 2005 with a \n$5,000 credit limit. High credit on the account reached $5,066. In March 2014, the creditor \ncharged off the account for $4,108. As of January 2017, the charged-off balance was still \nreported on Applicant\u2019s credit report as an outstanding delinquency. (GE 3.) During his first \ninterview in May 2017, Applicant asserted that he paid $125 per month on the account until \n2009. He lacked current information about the debt, and he indicated that he would look \ninto the debt. A week later, Applicant told the OPM investigator that Trans Union was \ninvestigating the debt. (GE 2.) In early January 2018, Applicant and his spouse asked the \ncreditor to contact them about resolving the debt. (AE M.) Just days before his security-\nclearance hearing, Applicant entered into an agreement to repay the debt at $25 monthly. \n(AE H; Tr. 61, 108.) \n \nStudent loan past due for $173 (SOR \u00b6 1.e) \n \n \nApplicant obtained federal student loans of $8,455 and $727 for college studies that \nhe did not complete. (GEs 2-3; AE A.) The loans were consolidated for repayment \npurposes. He explained in May 2017 that he had made $38 monthly payments until 2009, \nwhen he applied for a deferment. He presented no documentation showing his loan was \ndeferred, but available credit records suggest that he made no payments between hardship \ndeferments. His loan was 120 days past due from July 2012 through October 2012, June \n2015 through December 2015, and July 2016 through September 2016. (AE S.) As of \nDecember 2016, his account was 90 days past due for $173 on a $10,162 balance. (GE 3.) \nHis student loan was current in January 2017 but 90 to 120 days late from February to May \n2017. (AE S.) In February 2017, Applicant requested a financial hardship deferment, which \nhe asserts was granted through June 2017. (GE 2.) Documentation shows that he made \n$85 monthly payments in August 2017 and September 2017. (AE A.) He testified that he \nhas continued to make the monthly payment through automatic deduction. (Tr. 62, 109.) \nAfter his January 2018 payment, his student-loan balance was $9,627. (AE S.) \n \nInsurance collection debt for $231 (SOR \u00b6 1.f) \n \n \nIn October 2014, an insurance company placed a $231 debt from August 2014 for \ncollection. (GE 3.) Applicant did not recognize the debt during his May 2017 subject \ninterview. (GE 2.) He then contacted the creditor and was told the debt had been paid. (AE \nH.) When he answered the SOR, he asserted his account had a zero balance, and the \ndebt had been removed from his credit. He provided a telephone number for the creditor, \nand added that the collection agency would provide a confirmation letter. (Answer.) He \nexplained at his hearing that he was double billed and so owes no balance. (Tr. 62.) \n \n\n8 \n \nMedical collection debt for $93 (SOR \u00b6 1.g) \n \n \nIn June 2015, a $93 medical debt from May 2012 was placed for collection. (GE 3.) \nIn May 2017, Applicant told the OPM investigator that he recalled seeing the name of the \ncollection entity on mail, but he knew nothing about it because his wife handles the bills. \n(GE 2.) Applicant paid the debt in mid-October 2017. (AE B.) \n \nMedical collection debt for $38 (SOR \u00b6 1.h) \n \n \nAs of January 2017, the credit bureaus were reporting that a $38 medical debt from \nJuly 2011 was placed for collection in August 2012. (GE 3.) Applicant did not recognize the \ndebt when he was confronted about it during his May 2017 interview with the OPM \ninvestigator. (GE 3.) As of May 2018, he had no success in identifying the creditor. (AE H; \nTr. 62-63, 110-111.) He recently filed a dispute with Credit Karma. (Tr. 111.) \n \nMedical collection debt for $38 (SOR \u00b6 1.i) \n \n \nAs of January 2017, the credit bureaus were reporting that a $38 medical debt from \nJuly 2011 was placed for collection in January 2012. (GE 3.) Applicant did not recognize \nthe debt when he was confronted about it during his May 2017 interview with the OPM \ninvestigator. (GE 3.) As of May 2018, he had no success in identifying the creditor. (AE H; \nTr. 62-63, 110-111.) He recently filed a dispute with Credit Karma. (Tr. 111.) \n \nMedical collection debt for $25 (SOR \u00b6 1.j) \n \n \nIn May 2016, a $25 medical debt was placed for collection. (GE 3.) When queried \nabout the debt by an OPM investigator in October 2017, Applicant recognized the creditor \nas a medical billing company and speculated that the debt was from an emergency room \nvisit for his child. He denied knowing of any collection activity for the debt. (GE 2.) \nApplicant paid the debt in mid-October 2017. (AEs C, H.) \n \n \nAs of January 2018, Applicant\u2019s federal student loan and his and his spouse\u2019s \nprimary mortgage (balance $238,039) were considered current. Their mortgage had been \nseriously delinquent as recently as May 2016, but it was brought up-to-date in June 2016.2 \nThey modified their home loan to lower the monthly mortgage payments to $1,400 a \nmonth. (AE S; Tr. 56, 93-94.) \n \n \nApplicant earns $28 an hour in his current job. He works three 12-hour shifts a week \nand an extra four-hour shift every other week. (Tr. 67-68, 70, 80.) He requires a secret \nclearance because it is a condition of his employer\u2019s contract with the government. He \ndoes not access classified documentation and submits that he would be no risk to security. \nThe job is very important to him and his family because of the income and fewer hours and \nless stress than working in corrections. (AE T; Tr. 65-67, 71, 75, 79, 96.) His spouse last \nworked outside the home in 2005. She worked as a hair stylist, and developed medical \n                                                 \n2 Applicant testified about his primary mortgage loan that he fell behind but then refinanced for a loan at a fixed \nrate. (Tr. 56.) The file does not indicate the date for the refinancing. \n\n9 \n \nproblems that caused her to stop working. In 2006, she began receiving SSDI, which has \nbeen consistent over the years. (Tr. 73-74, 82.) As of May 2018, her SSDI was $1,320 plus \n$110 for their children every month. (Tr. 69.) Applicant\u2019s take-home pay averages $1,800 \nevery two weeks. He has worked overtime in the past but had not had any overtime during \nthe first five months of 2018. Any extra income is used for household bills. (Tr. 70-71, 80-\n81.) It took until late winter or early spring 2018 for Applicant to stabilize his finances. (Tr. \n86.) He testified, without any corroborating documentation, that he and his spouse have \n$1,000 to $1,500 in discretionary income after they pay their monthly expenses, excluding \ngroceries. When asked what he does with the discretionary income, Applicant responded, \n\u201cNow lately, we\u2019ve been fixing this stuff.\u201d (Tr. 112.) Applicant has not taken any vacations \naway from home in several years. He takes pride in maintaining his house and backyard. \n(Tr. 113.) \n \n \nApplicant and his spouse owe the IRS approximately $10,000 for tax year 2016 \nbecause of the disbursement of his retirement contributions by his previous employer. The \nIRS intercepted their tax refund for tax year 2017 and established an installment plan \nunder which Applicant and his spouse are required to repay their tax debt at $150 a month. \n(Tr. 115-117.) When asked when he made his first payment, Applicant responded, \u201cIt\u2019s \ngonna [sic] start. . . . So I just paid that, so next month.\u201d (Tr. 119.) \n \n \nApplicant presented a character reference letter dated August 2014 from a \nneighbor. The neighbor described Applicant as hardworking, driven, and possessing \nintegrity. He was dedicated to his family and offered assistance to friends and neighbors on \na regular basis even while working multiple jobs. (AE F.) In June 2016, this neighbor \nreiterated his support for Applicant as a valuable asset to any organization. (AE K.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s cousin attested to Applicant having good moral character and being well \nliked among his friends. As evidence of Applicant\u2019s kindness, she cited Applicant\u2019s care for \nan ill, elderly neighbor who has no local family to care for him. She described Applicant as \n\u201ca stand up guy.\u201d (AE U.) \n \n \nThe evening supervisor at Applicant\u2019s jobsite authored a character reference letter. \nHe described Applicant as an excellent officer, who is trustworthy and very attentive to his \njob duties. (AE V.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \n\n10 \n \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n\n11 \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nApplicant is legally liable on a defaulted second mortgage for $24,496 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \nand on the credit delinquencies in SOR \u00b6 1.b for $5,572 and SOR \u00b6 1.d for $4,108. The \nevidence also shows that he had a history of delinquency of up to 120 days at times on his \nfederal student loan (SOR \u00b6 1.e). Small medical debts for $93 (SOR \u00b6 1.g) and $25 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.j) were placed for collection, although it was not shown that Applicant was aware of \nthose debts when they first came due. Applicant is not required to be debt free, but he is \nrequired to manage his finances in a way as to exhibit sound judgment and responsibility. \nThe delinquent accounts establish disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy \ndebts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse defaulted on another credit card (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and a $5,484 \njudgment was granted against her in October 2015. As an authorized user, Applicant was \nnot contractually liable for the debt, although he admits that he used the account for \nhousehold expenses. However, he has accepted responsibility in court to repay the \njudgment debt for his spouse. As of January 2017, Applicant had three collection debts on \nhis credit report that he disputes: a $231 insurance debt (SOR \u00b6 1.f) in that it has been \npaid and two medical debts of $38 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i) because he has been unable to \nverify them. \n \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.14 of the Directive, the government has the burden of presenting \nevidence to establish controverted facts. The Appeal Board held in ISCR Case No. 08-\n12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010) that a credit report is sufficient to meet the \ngovernment\u2019s burden of producing evidence of delinquency: \n \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for the \ndebt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n \nApplicant did not provide any documentation showing that he paid the insurance \ndebt, but he provided a contact number for the collection entity that could verify a zero \n\n12 \n \nbalance. The $38 medical debts were incurred in 2011 and placed for collection in 2012. \nThe collection entities that reported the debts to the credit bureaus are not sufficiently \nidentified on the credit report for Applicant to determine their validity. The Fair Credit \nReporting Act requires removal of most negative financial items from a credit report seven \nyears from the first date of delinquency or the debt becoming collection barred because of \na state statute of limitations, whichever is longer.3 Even if they were owed at one time, they \nmedical debts may no longer be legally enforceable. \n \nThe burden is on Applicant to mitigate the evidence of financial delinquency. One or \nmore of the following conditions under AG \u00b6 20 may apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) has limited applicability. Some of the debts first became delinquent more \nthan five years ago. The second mortgage was charged off in February 2011, although \nsome payments were then made through September 2012. The credit-card account in \nSOR \u00b6 1.b was charged off in October 2011. The $93 medical collection debt was incurred \nin May 2012. However, the Appeal Board recently affirmed that unresolved debts are a \ncontinuing course of conduct. See ISCR Case No. 17-03146 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2018) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 15-08799 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2017)). As of Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance hearing in May 2018, he had not made any recent payments to satisfy or settle \nthe defaulted mortgage loan, despite being billed for the principal balance on a monthly \n                                                 \n3 Title 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c. See Federal Trade Commission website, Summary of Fair Credit Reporting Act \nUpdates at Section 605, https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0111-fair-credit-reportingact.pdf.   \n  \n\n13 \n \nbasis. He asserted during his May 2017 subject interview that he paid down the $5,752 \nbalance on the credit account in SOR \u00b6 1.b to $3,500, but he provided no proof of any \npayments. The $93 medical collection debt went unpaid until October 2017. He only \nrecently arranged to make $25 payments toward the $4,108 credit-card balance (SOR \u00b6 \n1.d) that was charged off in March 2014. His student loan was past due 120 days as \nrecently as February 2017 to May 2017. Such recent delinquency is not mitigated under \nAG \u00b6 20(a). \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) has some applicability in that Applicant and his spouse\u2019s finances were \nstressed because of the unexpected increase in their monthly obligation on their primary \nmortgage. A transaction history for the mortgage shows that their monthly payment \nincreased by $666 in October 2007. By taking on an adjustable-rate mortgage, Applicant \nand his spouse knowingly incurred the risk that their monthly payment could increase \nsubstantially. Even so, they had no control over a decline in the housing market, which \nnegatively impacted the value of their home. They were unable to refinance for a fixed-rate \nloan at that time because their home was worth less than the mortgage debt. Low income \nwas also a factor. After almost 20 years on the job as a correctional officer, he earned only \n$21 an hour. His spouse\u2019s SSDI was consistent, but their mortgage payment took more \nthan half of their income. They used the credit cards in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d to pay part of \ntheir mortgage payment. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) requires that an individual act responsibly under the circumstances, and \nApplicant\u2019s evidence in that regard falls short in some aspects. When Applicant lost his job \nas a correctional officer in 2016, he was disbursed $80,000 in his retirement contributions. \nHe spent more than half of those funds on two cars and the remainder went to catch up on \nhis primary mortgage and utility bills. Applicant is not faulted for giving priority to paying his \nmortgage, and he likely would have had trouble qualifying for a vehicle loan. However, he \nalso knew that he owed delinquent debt to the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d. There is no \nevidence that he made any effort keep those creditors apprised of his financial status. He \nclaimed in May 2017 that he had resolved his second mortgage by combining it with his \nprimary mortgage in a refinancing, and he expressed his intention to send the loan \ndocumentation to the creditor to prove the debt was not delinquent. He now acknowledges \nthat the mortgage debt was not resolved in a refinancing. He did not adequately explain the \ndiscrepancy in his accounts about resolution of that debt. Even acknowledging that it may \nhave taken some time for him to gather all the paperwork needed to submit an application \nto repay the debt, he was not proactive about addressing the debt when the application to \nrepay the debt though his primary mortgage was submitted during the week preceding his \nsecurity-clearance hearing. \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) apply to the federal student loan debt (SOR \u00b6 1.e) and the \nmedical collection debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.j. Applicant has made $85 monthly payments \nsince August 2017 under terms acceptable to his student-loan servicer. He paid the \nmedical collection debts in October 2017, albeit after he received the SOR. His very recent \napplication to include his $24,496 mortgage delinquency in his primary mortgage is some \nevidence of good faith on his part, but it would be premature to apply either AG \u00b6 20(c) or \nAG \u00b6 20(d) to that debt when no action had been taken on his application, and he had not \n\n14 \n \nmade any payments toward the delinquency. Applicant is not required, as a matter of law, \nto establish that he has satisfied each debt in the SOR. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-\n25499 at 2 (App. Bd. June 5, 2006). However, he is required under Appeal Board \nprecedent to demonstrate not only that he has a plan to resolve his financial problems, but \nthat he has taken significant actions to implement that plan. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-\n09684 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006.) Applicant testified that if his application to repay the \ndebt through his primary mortgage is not approved, he plans to make $150 monthly \npayments toward the debt. The Appeal Board has consistently held that a promise to pay a \ndebt in the future is not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner. \nSee e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-05390 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2010). Some doubts persist \nabout whether he can be counted on to make those payments. He entered into an \nagreement in court to repay the judgment debt (SOR \u00b6 1.c) for his spouse at $50 a month \nstarting January 2018. He did not make the payments for January through March 2018 for \nthe stated reason that he \u201cjust didn\u2019t get to pay it.\u201d He explained that his basement had \nbeen flooded with sewage around that time, and in late March or early May 2018, he had \nwater damage in his house from a burst water pipe. Even so, he reported net household \ndiscretionary income after expenses (excluding groceries) of $1,000 to $1,500 of late, and \nso he should have been able to make a $50 monthly payment. \n \n \nApplicant has also not made sufficient progress toward resolving the credit \ndelinquencies in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d. Regarding the $5,572 charged-off credit account \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b), Applicant contacted the creditor after he received the SOR, but the account \nhad been removed from collections. In early January 2018, Applicant and his spouse \nasked the creditor to contact them about resolving the debt. As of May 2018, they were still \nawaiting repayment terms from the creditor, but there is also no evidence that they followed \nup on their January 2018 inquiry. Just days before his security-clearance hearing, Applicant \nreportedly entered into an agreement to repay the $4,108 credit-card delinquency (SOR \u00b6 \n1.d) at $25 monthly. These belated efforts are not enough to satisfy either AG \u00b6 20(c) or \nAG \u00b6 20(d). \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) has some applicability. An authorized user on his spouse\u2019s account, \nApplicant was not contractually liable for repayment of the charged-off delinquency in SOR \n\u00b6 1.c. It is not considered for disqualifying purposes, and in that regard AG \u00b6 20(e) applies \nto the debt. Even so, the debt is relevant in mitigation. Applicant\u2019s reason for the delay in \ncommencing his repayment of the judgment debt for his spouse, that he \u201cjust didn\u2019t get to \npay it,\u201d raises doubt that he will make consistent payments to resolve the charged-off debts \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d. Applicant did not provide any documentation showing that the \nmedical collection debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i are not his debts. However, Applicant \ncannot reasonably be expected to pay a debt that is not sufficiently identified for him to \ndetermine its validity. \n \n \nApplicant testified that his financial situation has only recently stabilized to enable \nsome payments toward his delinquencies. In his favor, there is no evidence that he is \ncontinuing to take on new credit debt that could compromise his finances in the future. He \nis able to pay his current bills. However, he has not yet demonstrated a track record of \ntimely repayment on his financial obligations to enable a predicative judgment that his \n\n15 \n \nfinancial problems are safely behind him. He owes the IRS $10,000 for tax year 2016 that \nhe has agreed to repay at $150 a month. Whether it be medical expenses, burst water \npipes, or sewage issues, something has always come up that has diverted his attention \nfrom his finances. More progress is needed toward reestablishing financial stability to fully \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern about personal conduct is articulated in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigations or \nadjudicative processes. \n \n \nApplicant completed and certified to the accuracy of an e-QIP in October 2016 on \nwhich he responded negatively to the financial record inquiries concerning any delinquency \non routine accounts in the last seven years. Available credit information establishes that he \nwas contractually liable for three accounts that were charged off within seven years of his \ne-QIP. The second mortgage was charged off for $24,496 in March 2015. The credit \naccount for dental services was charged off for $5,752 in October 2011. A credit card used \nfor household expenses and to help pay his mortgage was charged off for $4,108 in March \n2014. A reasonable inference of deliberate falsification of his e-QIP could be drawn \nbecause of these debts. Assuming that Applicant held a good-faith but mistaken belief that \nthe delinquency on the second mortgage had been resolved in a refinancing of his primary \nmortgage, he recalled during his interview in May 2017 that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b had \nbeen placed for collection, and that he had stopped making payments on the debt in SOR \n\u00b6 1.d in approximately 2009 when his monthly mortgage obligation increased. He did not \ndispute that both debts should have been listed on his e-QIP. He told the OPM investigator \nthat he did not list the debts \u201cin error.\u201d Nonetheless, Applicant denies any intentional \nconcealment and cites stress, the lack of notice and opportunity to complete the form, and \nlack of information to complete the e-QIP accurately. \n \n  \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has explained the process for analyzing falsification \ncases, stating: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has \nthe burden of proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, \ndoes not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the \nomission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record evidence as a \nwhole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence \nconcerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state or mind at the time the omission \noccurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E \n\n16 \n \nand the burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present \nevidence to explain the omission. ISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. \nJan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, 2004)). \n \n \nThe delinquency dates for the accounts are sufficient to shift the burden to Applicant \nto explain his inaccurate denial to the e-QIP queries concerning any delinquency involving \nroutine accounts. Applicant presented evidence showing that, when he was told to report \nfor training, he was not advised that he would be required to complete the e-QIP or that he \nshould bring financial record information. He was given one night while he was staying in a \nhotel to complete the form. When he was interviewed in May 2017, he responded \naffirmatively when asked whether he had any delinquent accounts, and he disclosed the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.b, which he believed he had paid down to $3,500. He did not disclose the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.d before confrontation. His explanation is that he did not recall the debt \nbefore he was asked about it. The evidence falls short of establishing intentional \nconcealment needed under AG \u00b6 16(a), which does not apply when omissions are due to \nmistake, lack of recall, or other reason negating willful intent. AG \u00b6 16(a) provides: \n \n (a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nViewing the record as a whole, Applicant exhibited a lack of knowledge of the details \nof his financial accounts, which primarily raises concerns about his financial judgment. The \npersonal conduct security concerns related to deliberate falsification are not sufficiently \nproven. \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). The analyses under Guideline F and Guideline E are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nThe security clearance adjudication involves an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in light of the security guidelines in the Directive. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). Applicant has favorable character \nreferences from a neighbor, a friend, and a shift supervisor at work. He repeatedly \nexpressed the importance to him and his family of his job. In addition to the increase in his \nincome over his previous employment, it has improved his family life because he has felt \nless stress and has had more time to spend with his family. The Appeal Board has held \nthat the impact of an unfavorable decision on an applicant is not a relevant consideration in \ndetermining his or her eligibility for a security clearance. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-\n07563 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2011). \n\n17 \n \n \nApplicant was on notice as of May 2017 that the adverse credit information was of \nconcern to the DOD. He was not sufficiently proactive in contacting his creditors to verify \nhis debts and arrange repayment terms. It is well settled that once a concern arises \nregarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against \nthe grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 \n(9th Cir. 1990). At some future date, Applicant may be able to show a track record of \nconsistent, timely payments toward his debts that would provide sufficient guarantee that \nhe can be counted on to comply with his obligations. For the reasons noted, I am unable to \nfind that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security \nclearance at this time. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.j: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_____________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, or admitted in part, with comments, most of the factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.e., and 1.i.), and both of the factual allegations pertaining to foreign influence in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. and 2.b.). As to the allegations that he denied, Applicant also furnished comments. Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as an information technology force protection specialist since he joined his employer in January 2019. He was previously an electronics technician with another employer from 2 U.S. Department of State, Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, U.S. Relations with Philippines \u2013 Bilateral Fact Sheet (Jul 17, 2018); U.S. Department of State, Office of the Spokesperson, Secretary Pompeo\u2019s Meeting with Philippine Secretary of National Defense Lorenzana, (Sep 19, 2018); U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, Philippine 2017 Human Rights Report (undated); U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, Executive Summary, Philippines 2017 International Religious Freedom Report, (undated); U.S. Department of State, 2018 Trafficking i",

Edmunds, Esquire \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations and \nforeign influence concerns. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 8, 2016, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted \nElectronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security \nClearance Application. On October 13, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \nand modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG), for all covered \nindividuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or \neligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n03/12/2019\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n The \nSOR \nalleged \nsecurity \nconcerns \nunder \nGuidelines \nF \n(Financial \nConsiderations) and B (Foreign Influence) and detailed reasons why the DOD \nadjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to \nan administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, \ndenied, or revoked.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on November 17, 2017. In a sworn statement, dated \nJanuary 2, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to \nproceed on February 5, 2018. The case was assigned to me on March 20, 2018. While \nefforts were made to conduct the hearing as early as September 2018, Applicant was \ndeployed in Southwest Asia at the time, so scheduling awaited his return. Upon his return \nto the United States, it was determined that his sponsorship for a security clearance had \nbeen terminated, and no further action could be taken until such time as new sponsorship \nwas achieved. It was, and on December 26, 2018, a Notice of Hearing was issued, \nscheduling the hearing for January 30, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Government exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 5, Applicant Exhibits \n(AE) A through AE V, and Administrative exhibit I were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on February 7, 2019. I kept \nthe record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. He took advantage of that \nopportunity and timely submitted several documents. Unfortunately Applicant pre-marked \nseveral documents with designations that were redundant to some of the previously \nadmitted exhibits. Some of the pre-marked exhibits were partial or complete copies of \nearlier documents, and others were completely different documents. To avoid confusion, \nseveral pre-marked AEs were remarked and admitted as AE W through AE AD, without \nobjection. The record closed on February 26, 2019. \n \nRulings on Procedure \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain \nenumerated facts pertaining to the Republic of the Philippines (Philippines) appearing in \nfour U.S. Government publications which were identified, but only fragments of extracts \nof some of those publications were attached to the request.1 Facts are proper for \nadministrative notice when they are easily verifiable by an authorized source and relevant \nand material to the case. In this instance, the Government relied on source information \nregarding the Philippines in publications of the U.S. Department of State. AG \u00b6 6, Foreign \nInfluence, provides, \u201cAssessment of foreign contacts and interests should consider the \n                                                          \n1 Administrative Notice Request Document Extracts for Philippines: The publications cited are: U.S. \nDepartment of State, Bureau of Human Rights, Democracy, and Labor, Executive Summary: Philippines \n2016 Human Rights Report (Mar 3, 2017); U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, Country \nInformation (Jan 10, 2018); U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Diplomatic Security, Overseas Security \nAdvisory Council (OSAC), Philippines 2017 Crime & Safety Report (Feb 14, 2017); U.S. Department of \nState, Bureau of Consular Affairs, Philippines Travel Advisory (Jan 10, 2018).  \n \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \ncountry in which the foreign contact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, \nconsiderations such as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d A risk assessment in this \ncase necessitates administrative notice of facts concerning the Philippines. \n \nApplicant did not object to the administrative notice request, and, in fact, also \nrequested that I take administrative notice of certain additional enumerated facts \npertaining to the Philippines appearing in eight U.S. Government publications which were \nidentified.2 After weighing the reliability of the source documentation and assessing the \nrelevancy and materiality of the facts proposed by both the Government and Applicant, \npursuant to Rule 201, Federal Rules of Evidence, I take administrative notice of certain \nfacts,3 as set forth below under the Philippines subsection.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, or admitted in part, with comments, \nmost of the factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a. through 1.e., and 1.i.), and both of the factual allegations pertaining to foreign \ninfluence in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. and 2.b.). As to the allegations that he denied, \nApplicant also furnished comments. Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas an information technology force protection specialist since he joined his employer in \nJanuary 2019. He was previously an electronics technician with another employer from \n                                                          \n2 U.S. Department of State, Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, U.S. Relations with Philippines \n\u2013 Bilateral Fact Sheet (Jul 17, 2018); U.S. Department of State, Office of the Spokesperson, Secretary \nPompeo\u2019s Meeting with Philippine Secretary of National Defense Lorenzana, (Sep 19, 2018); U.S. \nDepartment of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, Philippine 2017 Human Rights \nReport (undated); U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, Executive \nSummary, Philippines 2017 International Religious Freedom Report, (undated); U.S. Department of State, \n2018 Trafficking in Persons Report \u2013 Philippines (undated); Central Intelligence Agency, The World \nFactbook \u2013 Philippines (Dec 12, 2018); Congressional Research Service, The Republic of the Philippines \nand U.S. Interests \u2013 2014 (May 15, 2014); Congressional Research Service, DOD\u2019s Rotation to the \nPhilippines (May 31, 2016). \n \n3 Administrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative \nproceedings. See McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986); \nISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. \n12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)). The most common basis for \nadministrative notice at ISCR proceedings is to notice facts that are either well known or from government \nreports. See Stein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for \nadministrative notice). Requests for administrative notice may utilize authoritative information or sources \nfrom the internet. See, e.g. Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557 (2006) (citing internet sources for numerous \ndocuments). In this instance, although Department Counsel has selected only certain pages of facts \nappearing in the identified publications, I have not limited myself to only those facts, but have considered \nthe publications in their entirety. \n \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nFebruary 2017. Applicant has been employed as a civilian contractor in several countries \nin the Middle East for over eight years, commencing in 2010. The day following the \nhearing, he was scheduled to return to the Middle East. A 2005 high school graduate, \nApplicant received a technical degree in weather technology in 2010; and a bachelor of \nscience in business administration, magna cum laude, in 2017. He enlisted in the U.S. Air \nForce in December 2005, and served on active duty until he was honorably discharged \nas a senior airman (E-4) in January 2010. He was granted a secret clearance in 2005. \nApplicant has never been married, but he began cohabiting with his now-fianc\u00e9e in July \n2012. He has one child, born in 2013.  \n \nMilitary Awards and Decorations \n \n \nDuring his period of military service, Applicant served brief deployments in both \nAfghanistan (as a force protection specialist) and Iraq (as a senior weather forecaster). \nHe was awarded the following awards and decorations: the Air Force Achievement Medal, \nthe Air Force Outstanding Unit Award, the Air Force Good Conduct Medal, the National \nDefense Service Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the Global War on Terrorism \nService Medal, the Air Force Overseas Ribbon Long, the Air Force Expeditionary Service \nRibbon with gold border, the Air Force Longevity Service Ribbon, the Small Arms Expert \nMarksmanship Ribbon (Rifle), the Air Force Training Ribbon, and the NATO Medal.4 \n \nFinancial Considerations5 \nFor approximately ten years, Applicant has supposedly been supporting his \nparents \u2013 his father had a stroke and a quadruple bypass \u2013 with a monthly payment which \nhe inconsistently quantified as $500, $700, and $1,000.6 It is unclear when Applicant first \nstarted having financial difficulties, although he acknowledged that there was some \nsignificant adverse impact on his finances as a result of his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s pregnancy in 2013. \nBecause she was going through pregnancy alone, without any form of family support, \nApplicant was motivated to go to the Philippines to assist her. In addition, since the birth \nof his child, Applicant purportedly spent about $15,000 in medical expenses because his \nfianc\u00e9e did not have medical insurance. He has also been sending his fianc\u00e9e \napproximately $1,500 per month in child support, as well as $800 to $1,000 per month for \nhousing.7 During the hearing, Applicant said the monthly rent for the apartment, in a major \n                                                          \n4 AE D (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty (DD Form 214), dated January 12, \n2010); AE C (Resume, undated); AE B (Biography, undated). \n \n5 General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below can be found in \nthe following exhibits: GE 1 (e-QIP, dated March 8, 2016); GE 3 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and \nEquifax Credit Report, dated April 26, 2016); GE 4 (Equifax Credit Report, dated August 29, 2018); AE Y \n(TransUnion Credit Report, dated January 10, 2018); GE 2 (Triggered Enhanced Subject Interview, dated \nMarch 19, 2017); and Answer to the SOR, dated January 2, 2018.  \n \n6 During the hearing, Applicant quantified the payment as $1,000. See Tr. at 31-32. However, in \nhis Schedule I \u2013 Current Income of Individual Debtor(s), which was incorporated in his Voluntary Petition \nfor Bankruptcy, dated August 14, 2013 (GE 5), he listed the payment as $500 and $700. He did not submit \nany documentation such as cancelled checks or bank account statements to support his claim that he was \npaying any amount to his father. \n \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \ncity, was $2,500.8 With respect to the purported medical expenses, child support, or \nhousing support, Applicant did not submit any documentation to support his claim that \nsuch payments had been made. \nOn August 14, 2013, three months before his child was born, Applicant filed a \nvoluntary Petition for Bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, primarily \nto save his residence from foreclosure. He identified $208,460 owed to creditors holding \nsecured claims (including $8,000 in mortgage arrears); $3,500 owed to creditors holding \nunsecured priority claims; and $134,168 owed to creditors holding unsecured nonpriority \nclaims.9 The child was born in the Philippines through C-section in November 2013, and \nbecause Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e and child needed extended assistance, he remained in the \nPhilippines and allowed his employment contract to expire in December 2013. Applicant \ncontinued to draw on his savings and a housing allowance to pay his bills. However, the \ncombination of pregnancy and childcare expenses, and a lack of income, eventually \ncaused extreme financial hardship for Applicant, and he was unable to comply with the \nBankruptcy Trustee\u2019s payment plan, paying only a net total of $3,795 for attorney\u2019s fees \nand Trustee expenses and compensation. No payments were made to any creditors. On \nMay 1, 2014, the bankruptcy case was dismissed. \nWhen the bankruptcy was dismissed, all of Applicant\u2019s delinquent accounts \nreturned to an active collection status, but he claimed that he did not have sufficient funds \nto address them. One residence was foreclosed in October 2014. In March 2016, when \ncompleting his e-QIP, Applicant noted some financial issues such as delinquencies, \ncollections, or accounts being charged off, as well as the foreclosure. In March 2017, \nApplicant was interviewed by an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM). During that interview, Applicant stated that since his bankruptcy \ndismissal, he engaged the professional services of a law firm to negotiate settlements \nand set up payment plans for all of his delinquent debts, with the one exception being the \nmortgage lender on the foreclosed residence.10 He failed to submit any documentation to \nsupport his claims that he has an agreement with the law firm; that the firm is to perform \nany financial services for him; or that any such prepayment agreements or payments have \nbeen made. Applicant added that he \u201cexpects to be in the process of resolving [the \ndelinquent accounts] this month,\u201d11 meaning March 2017.  \nNine months later, on December 4, 2017, Applicant enrolled with a credit \ncounseling service to assist him in preparing a customized action plan, and a detailed \nbudget analysis, as well as to review options or alternatives regarding his debt. The \nprogram introduced him to several core financial concepts, including prioritizing expenses \n                                                          \n7 Tr. at 32-34, 47. \n \n8 Tr. at 72. \n \n9 GE 5, supra note 6. \n \n10 GE 2, supra note 5, at 7. \n \n11 GE 2, supra note 5, at 7. \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nin order to set financial goals; and examining spending habits in terms of fixed, variable \nand periodic expenses.12  \nOn September 12, 2018, Applicant engaged the services of a \u201ccredit repair\u201d \norganization to require that the credit reporting agencies demonstrate compliance with \nthe various laws governing fair, accurate and substantiated consumer credit reporting,13 \nessentially to challenge the accuracy of his credit reports by disputing the reported status \nof various listed accounts. Applicant explained that they are to dispute \u201cjust some old \naccounts . . . that should have been taken off. . . .\u201d14 Applicant pays the organization $100 \nper month for their services, and while various disputes have been filed, Applicant was \nunable to articulate any specific reasons to provide a specific reasonable basis to do so. \nOn September 21, 2018, approximately one year after the SOR was issued, \nApplicant engaged the professional services of a debt settlement organization to \nnegotiate and secure settlements with his creditors. Under that program, Applicant listed \nfive creditors with total debts of $121,489 for which settlements and payments are to be \nnegotiated, and Applicant is to pay the organization $1,834 per month for a period of 53 \nmonths. The total estimated cost of the program is $30,372.15  \nIn addition to Applicant\u2019s Chapter 13 Bankruptcy (SOR \u00b6 1.i.), the SOR identified \neight delinquent accounts that had been placed for collection, charged off, or foreclosed \nas generally reflected by Applicant\u2019s April 2016, August 2017, or January 2019 credit \nreports. Those debts, minus the foreclosure, total approximately $121,161. Applicant\u2019s \noutstanding financial obligations, all of which were placed for collection, alleged in the \nSOR are as follows:  \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a.): This is a home mortgage with a high credit of $205,168 and an \nunpaid balance of $193,409 that was foreclosed in October 2014 when the fair market \nvalue of the property was listed as $165,847. A Substitute Form 1099-A, Acquisition or \nAbandonment of Secured Property, was issued to him.16 Without furnishing a reason, \nApplicant disputed the account after foreclosure. Since the fair market value of the \nproperty is less than the outstanding balance, it is likely there is a deficiency remaining. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b.): This is an unsecured loan with an unpaid balance of $45,369 that \nwas charged off in June 2014. In October 2018, one year after the SOR was issued, \nApplicant and the creditor agreed to a settlement for $18,148, with one $553 payment to \nbe made by October 31, 2018, and 17 remaining monthly payments of $1,035 to be made \n                                                          \n \n12 AE L (Action Plan and Budget Analysis, dated December 4, 2017). \n \n13 AE I (Engagement Agreement, dated September 12, 2018). \n \n14 Tr. at 80-82 \n \n15 AE I (Debt Settlement & Negotiation Services Agreement, dated September 21, 2018). \n \n16 AE U (Substitute Form 1099-A, dated October 7, 2014). \n \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nby the end of each succeeding month until March 31, 2020. Applicant submitted \ndocumentation to reflect several continuing payments under the settlement.17 Without \nfurnishing a reason, Applicant disputed the account after resolution. The account is in the \nprocess of being resolved. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c.): This is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $10,323 that \nwas charged off. While the account is one of those included in his debt settlement \norganization agreement, Applicant did not offer any evidence to indicate that settlement \nnegotiations had taken place with the creditor or that any payments had yet been made. \nThe account is not yet in the process of being resolved. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d.): This is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $10,791 that \nwas charged off. In January 2019, 15 months after the SOR was issued, Applicant and \nthe creditor agreed to a settlement for $4,020, with 12 payments of $335 to be made by \nthe 15th of each month starting in January 2019 and continuing each succeeding month \nuntil December 2019. Applicant submitted documentation to reflect only one such \npayment under the settlement.18 Nevertheless, the account is in the process of being \nresolved. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e.): This is an unspecified type of account with an unpaid balance of \n$31,174. While the account is one of those included in his debt settlement organization \nagreement, Applicant did not offer any evidence to indicate that settlement negotiations \nhad taken place with the creditor or that any payments had yet been made. The account \nis not yet in the process of being resolved. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.f.): This is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $14,725. In \nhis Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied that he still owed any money on the account, \nclaiming that he had paid it in full in April 2017. However, the account to which the \nsettlement referred, according to the creditor, had a different account number, and the \nsettlement offer was in the approximate amount of $1,244, a significant difference from \nthe original unpaid balance.19 Further confusing the situation was the reference by \nApplicant in his Answer to the SOR to another account with a different creditor. In the \nabsence of some documentation indicating that the settlement was in connection with the \nsubject SOR account, this account remains unresolved. \n                                                          \n17 AE T (Letter, dated October 9, 2018); AE T (Account Activity Statement, undated); AE X (Account \nActivity Statement, undated). \n \n18 AE T (Letter, dated January 10, 2019); AE T (Account Activity Statement), supra note 17; AE X \n(Account Activity Statement), supra note 17. \n \n19 AE K (Letter, dated April 19, 2017). \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.g.): This is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $6,291. In \nApril 2017, Applicant and the creditor agreed to a full settlement for $2,496, and that \npayment was received by the creditor in May 2017.20 The account has been resolved. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.h.): This is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $2,488 with \nthe same creditor alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f., above. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant \ndenied that he still owed any money on the account, claiming that he had paid it in full in \nApril 2017. However, the account to which the settlement referred, according to the \ncreditor, had a different account number, and the settlement offer was in the approximate \namount of $1,595, a slight difference from the original unpaid balance.21 Further confusing \nthe situation was the reference by Applicant in his Answer to the SOR to another account \nwith a different creditor, referred to in SOR \u00b6 1.f. In the absence of some documentation \nindicating that the settlement was in connection with the subject SOR account, this \naccount remains unresolved. \nApplicant\u2019s income over the past few years has fluctuated. In August 2013, as part \nof his Bankruptcy Petition, Applicant reported his average monthly net income as $6,785 \n\u2013 or generally approximately $80,000 per year; his average monthly expenses as $5,395; \nand an average monthly remainder of $1,390.22 Upon obtaining a new position in October \n2014, following his period of unemployment, his new annual salary was between \n$120,000 and $140,000.23 In 2017-18, Applicant\u2019s annual salary was about $111,000,24 \nand as of two days before the hearing, it increased to $154,000.25 \nDuring the hearing, Applicant submitted a Personal Financial Statement. It \nindicated that his monthly net salary was $8,386; monthly expenses were $4,700; monthly \ndebt payments were $1,455; leaving a monthly remainder of $2,231, available for \ndiscretionary saving or spending.26 However, considering his newly increased salary, the \ninformation in that Personal Financial Statement was no longer considered accurate, and \nanother one was solicited. A substitute Personal Financial Statement was submitted after \nthe hearing. It indicated that his monthly net salary was $8,345; monthly expenses were \n$2,480; monthly debt payments were $2,145; leaving a monthly remainder of $3,720, \navailable for discretionary saving or spending.27 Despite his significant delinquent debt \n                                                          \n20 AE J (Letter, dated May 3, 2017). \n \n21 AE K (Letter, dated April 24, 2017). \n \n22 GE 5 (Schedule I), supra note 6; GE 5 (Schedule J \u2013 Current Expenditures of Individual Debtor(s), \ndated August 14, 2013); Tr. at 48. \n \n23 Tr. at 48-49, 55. \n \n24 Tr. at 30. \n \n25 Tr. at 29, 56. \n \n26 GE M (Personal Financial Statement, undated). \n \n27 GE W (Personal Financial Statement, undated). \n \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \ntotal, and Applicant\u2019s relatively modest monthly payments, considering his annual income, \nthere is evidence to indicate that Applicant\u2019s financial situation is now under control.  \nCharacter References \n \nThe Chief, Special Programs Division, Pacific Air Forces, a major, worked closely, \non a daily basis, with Applicant in Iraq for approximately six months. Applicant was timely, \ncourteous, and professional, in addition to being a critical lynchpin as a member and \nliaison to his team and the U.S. Department of State. Applicant excelled and maintained \nintegrity and honesty with all tasks at hand.28 Applicant\u2019s former flight commander, a \nretired captain, characterized him as a highly skilled and motivated young man who has \nshown he has the leadership and skill to excel at any task. She had total confidence in \nhis leadership ability throughout their time together. Applicant\u2019s cool-headed thinking and \noverall planning allowed other to see an example of true leadership. His demonstrated \nleadership skills lead to the squadron leadership trusting him to represent the squadron \nand career field through deployments supporting operations. She noted that Applicant\u2019s \ntrustworthiness will not disappoint.29 Applicant\u2019s former training manager, a retired master \nsergeant, stated that Applicant has proven to be trustworthy and reliable.30 Other former \ncolleagues who have worked with Applicant in Kuwait and Iraq are equally effusive about \nhis integrity, trustworthiness, positive attitude, loyalty, and dedication. \n \nForeign Influence31 \n \n \nApplicant was born in the Philippines. He entered the United States in 1995, and \nhe derived his U.S. citizenship through his parents when they became naturalized U.S. \ncitizens in 2002. Applicant\u2019s parents are both Philippine-born residents and citizens of the \nUnited States. His two brothers are also Philippine-born residents and citizens of the \nUnited States. None of Applicant\u2019s family members, identified above, are of any security \ninterest. \n \nApplicant met a young lady in July 2012 when he was vacationing in the \nPhilippines. She was both a resident and citizen of the Philippines, working as a disc \njockey. Over time, Applicant and the young lady developed a close relationship, and she \nbecame pregnant and they became engaged. Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e gave birth to their \ndaughter in the Philippines in 2013.32 The child acquired U.S. citizenship at birth as \nestablished by documentary evidence presented to the Consular Service of the United \n                                                          \n28 AE A (Character Reference, dated December 1, 2017). \n \n29 AE A (Character Reference, dated November 29, 2017). \n \n30 AE A (Character Reference, dated November 30, 2017). \n31 To protect Applicant and his family\u2019s privacy, the facts in this decision do not specifically describe \nemployment, names of individuals, groups, or locations. The cited sources: GE 1, supra note 5; GE 2, supra \nnote 5; and Answer to the SOR, supra note 5. \n \n32 AE N (Delayed Certificate of Live Birth). \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nStates at Manila, Philippines.33 She was issued a U.S. passport in November 2018.34 \nApplicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e and daughter reside in an apartment in the Philippines nearly 500 \nmiles from Manila, and a greater distance from areas in the Philippines that are generally \nunder terrorist threats. Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e has applied for a K-1 Visa to enter the United \nStates with the intent of marrying Applicant.35 There is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s \nfianc\u00e9e is affiliated with a foreign government, military, security, or intelligence service. \n \nPhilippines \n \nThe Philippine Islands became a Spanish colony during the 16th century, and they \nwere ceded to the United States in 1898 following the Spanish-American War. In 1935 they \nbecame a self-governing commonwealth, and on July 4, 1946, attained independence. The \nPhilippines is a multiparty, constitutional republic with a bicameral legislature. Over the \nensuing years, there have been periods of economic and political stability, and instability, with \nseveral coup attempts, charges of corruption, and impeachment efforts. The United States \nclosed its last military bases, including Clark Air Base, the largest U.S. air base outside of the \nUnited States, in 1992. The country conducted nationwide elections in May 2016 for the \npresidency, both houses of congress, provincial governors, and local government officials. \nSome local elections were delayed for one year. International and national observers viewed \nthe 2016 elections as generally free and fair but reported that vote buying was widespread \nand that dynastic political families continued to monopolize elective offices.  \n \nIn its most recent annual human rights report, the U.S. Department of State reported \nthat the most significant human rights issues included: killings by security forces, vigilantes \nand others allegedly connected to the government, and by insurgents; torture and abuse of \nprisoners and detainees by security forces; often harsh and life threatening prison conditions; \nwarrantless arrests by security forces and cases of apparent government disregard for legal \nrights and due process; political prisoners; killings of and threats against journalists; official \ncorruption and abuse of power; threats of violence against human rights activists; violence \nagainst women; and forced labor. \n  \nExtrajudicial killings have been the chief human rights concern in the country for many \nyears and, after a sharp rise with the onset of the antidrug campaign in 2016, they continued \nin 2017. From January to the end of September 2017, media reports chronicled more than \n                                                          \n \n33 AE N (Consular Report of Birth Abroad of a Citizen of the United States of America, dated \nNovember 6, 2018); Tr. at 27, 51. \n \n34 AE N (U.S. Passport, dated November 8, 2018). \n \n35 AE AB (Declaration, dated February 13, 2019); Tr. at 50. The fianc\u00e9(e) K-1 nonimmigrant visa is \nfor the foreign-citizen fianc\u00e9(e) of a United States (U.S.) citizen. The K-1 visa permits the foreign-citizen \nfianc\u00e9(e) to travel to the United States and marry his or her U.S. citizen sponsor within 90 days of \narrival. The foreign-citizen will then apply for adjustment of status to a permanent resident (LPR) with the \nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Because a \nfianc\u00e9(e) visa permits the holder to immigrate to the U.S. and marry a U.S. citizen shortly after arrival in the \nUnited States, the fianc\u00e9(e) must meet some of the requirements of an immigrant visa. See \nhttps://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/family-immigration/nonimmigrant-visa-for-a-\nfiance-k-1.html#1 \n \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \n900 fatalities in police operations suspected to be connected with the government\u2019s antidrug \ncampaign. Police claimed to have begun investigations of all reports of extrajudicial killings. \nAs of August 2017, police claimed to have resolved 1,889 cases, and 4,373 remained under \ninvestigation.  \n \nThe Philippine Government investigated a limited number of reported human rights \nabuses, including abuses by its own forces, paramilitaries, and insurgent and terrorist groups. \nConcerns about police impunity increased significantly following the sharp increase in police \nkillings. President Duterte publicly rejected criticism of police killings, but he said authorities \nwould investigate any actions taken outside the rule of law. Significant concerns persisted \nabout impunity of civilian national and local government officials and powerful business and \ncommercial figures.  \n \nIn May 2017, members of the terrorist Maute Group, a radical Islamist group \ncomposed of former Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and supporters of other extremist \norganizations attacked Marawi City, on the southern island of Mindanao. In response \nPresident Duterte declared martial law in all of Mindanao. The Armed Forces of the \nPhilippines (AFP) restored government control of the city in October 2017. Approximately \n360,000 persons were displaced as a result of the crisis. \n \nConflicts continued between the government and Muslim separatist, communist \ninsurgent, and terrorist groups, displacing communities and resulting in deaths of security \nforce members and civilians. Terrorist organizations engaged in kidnappings for ransom, \nbombings of civilian targets, beheadings, and the use of child soldiers in combat or auxiliary \nroles, and the organizations operated shadow governments in areas they controlled. The \ngovernment called off negotiations with the National Democratic Front of the Philippines, the \npolitical arm of the New People\u2019s Army, in early 2017 after clashes between the armed forces \nand New People\u2019s Army guerilla fighters in violation of a 2016 ceasefire. The government \nresumed peace talks with the MILF.  \n \nIn the Philippines, the emergence of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS)-affiliated \nextremist groups, persistent kidnappings by the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), attacks on \ngovernment forces, and bombings, all indicated that domestic and international terrorism \nremained a serious problem. Terrorist acts included criminal activities designed to generate \nrevenue, such as kidnapping for ransom, extortion, and bombings for hire. However, ASG \nfighters on Sulu beheaded two Canadian hostages, one in April and one in June 2016, when \ntheir ransoms were not paid. The two men had been held captive since September 2015. \n  \nThe Philippine Government recognized the threat posed by radicalized Philippine \ncitizens supporting ISIS and ISIS supporters traveling to the Philippines to promote violent \nextremism in the country or seek safe haven. Members of numerous groups \u2013 including parts \nof the ASG; the Dawlah Islamiyah Lanao (DIL), commonly referred to as the Maute Group; \nand Ansar-al Khalifah Philippines \u2013 have pledged allegiance to ISIS. ISIS called on its \nsupporters in Southeast Asia to join these groups and attack targets in the Philippines, and \nnamed former ASG leader Isnilon Hapilon as its regional leader.  \n \nPhilippine military and police counterterrorism efforts kept up pressure on terrorist \norganizations, but were unable to prevent numerous attacks against government, public, and \nprivate facilities, primarily in central and western Mindanao. In November 2016, a bomb was \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \ndiscovered and disarmed near the U.S. Embassy in Manila. In April and May 2017, bombings \nin Quiapo, Manila killed two and injured twenty, and conflict between terrorist groups and \nPhilippines security forces in Marawi City, Mindanao resulted in hundreds of dead and injured. \nIn June 2017, security forces rescued at least 60 civilians held hostage by members of the \nIslamic militant group Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) after the group launched \nan attack in North Cotabato. In August 2017, suspected members of the ASG attacked a \nvillage in Basilan, killing at least nine civilians and wounding a dozen more. In December \n2017, an attack on a police station in Misamis Oriental by approximately 100 members of the \nNew People\u2019s Army (NPA), which is the armed winged of the Communist Party of the \nPhilippines (CPP), exemplified the group\u2019s frequent strikes at military, police, and local \ngovernment targets. \n  \nThe U.S. Department of State advises all U.S. citizens contemplating travel to the \nPhilippines to exercise increased caution due to crime, terrorism, and civil unrest. U.S. \ncitizens are specifically advised to not travel to Sulu Archipelago, including the southern Sulu \nSea, and Marawi City, and to reconsider travel to Mindanao which remains under a state of \nnational emergency. Terrorist and armed groups continue plotting possible kidnappings, \nbombings, and other attacks in the Philippines. The U.S. Department of State has assessed \nManila as being a high-threat location of crime directed at or affecting official U.S. government \nofficials. As noted above, Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e and daughter reside nowhere near the \nidentified areas of unrest and terrorist threats. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d36 As Commander in Chief, the President has \nthe authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to \ndetermine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to \ngrant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d37   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \n                                                          \n36 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \n37 Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as \namended and modified.    \n \n\n \n13 \n                                      \n \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d38 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nhas the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation \nor mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.39  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d40  \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d41 Thus, nothing in this \ndecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in \npart, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines \nthe President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, \nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n \n \n                                                          \n38 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla \nbut less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \n \n\n \n14 \n                                      \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nIn addition to Applicant\u2019s dismissed Chapter 13 bankruptcy, the SOR identified \neight delinquent accounts that had been placed for collection, charged off, or foreclosed, \ntotaling approximately $121,161 (not including the foreclosure). One house was \nforeclosed, and three accounts were charged off. Several of those accounts remain \nunaddressed and delinquent. Although Applicant\u2019s most recent Personal Financial \nStatement indicates that he has a monthly remainder of $3,720 available each month for \ndiscretionary saving or spending, he has apparently chosen not to increase his monthly \ncontributions to effectuate a more rapid resolution of those delinquent debts, and it is \nunclear if he is unwilling to do so. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b) and 19(c) have been established.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n\n \n15 \n                                      \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;42 \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;43 and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply, but 20(e) does not apply. The nature, \nfrequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial difficulties make it difficult to \nconclude that it occurred \u201cso long ago\u201d or \u201cwas so infrequent,\u201d or that it is \u201cunlikely to \nrecur.\u201d Applicant failed to explain why or how he got into debt before 2013 when he had \n$134,168 in creditors holding unsecured nonpriority claims. Instead, he referred to \nexpenses for his parents, his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s pregnancy and medical expenses, his child-care \nexpenses, and his unemployment that started in December 2013. Once he obtained new \n                                                          \n42 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can \napplicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed \nas recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \n \n43 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some \nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not \ndefine the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must do more than \nmerely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy [or \nstatute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n\n \n16 \n                                      \n \nemployment in October 2014, Applicant\u2019s annual salary increased to between $120,000 \nand $140,000; decreased to $111,000 in 2017, and then increased to $154,000 in early \n2019. With a substantial salary, Applicant might have more reasonably started addressing \nhis creditors in 2014, not waiting until April 2017 to do so. Filing the Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy, primarily as a tactical measure to save his house from foreclosure, was not \nsuccessful.  \nTo his credit, Applicant finally decided to address his delinquent debts around the \ntime he was interviewed by the OPM investigator, and before the SOR was issued. He \nexplored various ways of engaging his creditors, and finally hired a law firm to negotiate \nsettlements and set up payment plans, and actually took some meaningful resolution \nactions. In December 2017, after the SOR was issued, he enrolled with a credit \ncounseling service to assist him in preparing a customized action plan. He has been \nmaking monthly payments to that counseling service since October 2018. As a result of \nApplicant\u2019s independent actions, or his coordinated actions, he has resolved several \naccounts, and is in the process of resolving other accounts. He submitted some \ndocumentation to reflect that he had made various efforts to resolve several of his \naccounts. While he contended he had made additional efforts to resolve other accounts, \nhe failed to submit any documentation to support those contentions. \nApplicant has obtained financial counseling from a legitimate and credible source. \nBecause he was unable to articulate a reasonable basis for disputing the legitimacy of \nsome accounts, Applicant is given no credit for doing so. Normally, an applicant who \nbegins to resolve his financial problems only after being placed on notice that his or her \nsecurity clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat to his or her \nown interests.44 In this instance, there is clear evidence that Applicant took some \nresolution actions before he received the SOR. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, there is significant evidence \nthat, after a substantial delay, Applicant finally embraced the paradigm of fiscal \nresponsibility and commenced his corrective actions in an effort to start resolving his \ndelinquent debts. There is clear evidence to conclude that Applicant\u2019s finances are now \n                                                          \n44 See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at \n3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). \n \n\n \n17 \n                                      \n \nunder control. Applicant\u2019s actions under the circumstances no longer cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.45 \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in AG \n\u00b6 6.  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 7: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e is a resident and citizen of the Philippines, and his minor \ndaughter, a U.S. citizen, currently resides with her mother in the Philippines. There is no \nevidence that his fianc\u00e9e is affiliated with a foreign government, military, security, or \nintelligence service. Applicant maintains an apartment for them in a city that is well outside \nof the areas of heightened interest in the Philippines, and when he is not visiting them \nfrom his Middle East business location, he speaks with them regularly. Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e \nhas applied for a K-1 Visa to enter the United States with the intent of marrying Applicant. \nHis frequent contacts with his fianc\u00e9e and daughter in the Philippines are manifestations \nof his care and concern for them. \n \n                                                          \n45 See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \n \n\n \n18 \n                                      \n \n When foreign family ties are involved, the totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a \nforeign country as well as each individual family member must be analyzed.46 If only one \nrelative lives in a foreign country, and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this \nfactor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially \nresult in the compromise of classified information.47 The mere possession of close family \nties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under \nGuideline B. Moreover, Guideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United \nStates.48 Furthermore, \u201ceven friendly countries can have profound disagreements with \nthe United States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity.\u201d49 Friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields.  \n \nNevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United \nStates, and its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an \napplicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or \nthe country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the United States. It is \nreasonable to presume that a contentious relationship, or the absence of a democratic \ngovernment, is not determinative, but it may make it more likely that a foreign government \nwould attempt to exploit a U.S. citizen through relatives or associates in that foreign \ncountry. In considering the nature of the government, an administrative judge must also \nconsider any terrorist activity in the country at issue.50  \n \nIn this instance, there is no evidence to reflect that the Philippines engages in \neconomic espionage or military intelligence activity directed toward the United States. \nThe most significant fear is not the official actions of the government, but rather the acts \nof terrorism conducted against individuals and groups, not necessarily specifically \ntargeting Americans. Those terrorist activities in the Philippines are sufficient to establish \na \u201cheightened risk\u201d \u2013 a risk that is greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \nmember living under a foreign government where terrorist activities frequently take place. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) have been established.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from foreign influence under AG \u00b6 8: \n                                                          \n46 ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd.

Dec. 7, 2006). \n \n\n \n19 \n                                      \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b) apply, but 8(c) does not apply. As noted above, there is no \nevidence that Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e has been a political activist, challenging the policies of \nthe Philippine Government. There is no evidence that she currently works for or has ever \nworked for the Philippine Government, military, or intelligence service. Likewise, there is \nno evidence that terrorists or the Philippine Government have approached or threatened \nApplicant or his fianc\u00e9e or his minor child for any reason. And, there is no evidence that \nthey currently engage in activities which would bring attention to them or that they or other \nPhilippine elements are even aware of Applicant\u2019s work. As such, there is a reduced \npossibility that Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e or minor child would be targets for coercion or \nexploitation. Furthermore, in this instance, if the most significant \u201cheightened risk\u201d is \nApplicant\u2019s or his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s or minor child\u2019s potential exposure to terrorist threats, not \ngovernment intervention, residing in the Philippines is not so different from residing in \nNew York City (2001), Paris (2015), Brussels (2016), Orlando (2016), Barcelona (2017), \nor London (2017), the locations of significant terrorist attacks. \n \nApplicant\u2019s loyalty and connections to his fianc\u00e9e and minor child are positive \ncharacter traits. Applicant\u2019s ties to the United States run relatively deep. He immigrated \nto the United States with his parents 24 years ago, and he derived his U.S. citizenship \nthrough his parents when they became naturalized U.S. citizens in 2002. His parents and \nboth brothers are U.S. citizens, residing in the United States. His fianc\u00e9e has applied for \na K-1 Visa to enter the United States. Applicant was honorably discharged from the U.S. \nAir Force after serving on deployments to both Afghanistan and Iraq. His support of the \nDOD as a civilian contractor throughout the Middle East for over eight years, including \nthe dangers that service entailed, weighs towards mitigating security concerns. He seeks \na security clearance to enable him to continue serving the Middle East providing \nassistance to DOD. He has clearly shown his patriotism, loyalty, and fidelity to the United \nStates during his years in the Middle East as both a member of the military and as a \n\n \n20 \n                                      \n \ncivilian contractor.51 His deep relationship with the United States weighs against a security \nconcern for the relationships he has with his fianc\u00e9e and minor child. \n \nAnalysis \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.52   \nThere is some disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept. To save his \nresidence from foreclosure, Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the U.S. \nBankruptcy Code in 2013, listing $134,168 in creditors holding unsecured nonpriority \nclaims. The effort failed when the house was foreclosed, and Applicant cancelled his \nbankruptcy efforts without making any payments to creditors. There is little evidence to \nindicate that between 2013 and 2017, Applicant made any good-faith efforts to resolve his \ndelinquent debts. In addition to the foreclosure and the bankruptcy, the SOR identified \n                                                          \n51 In ISCR Case No. 17-00629 at 4 (App. Bd. May 24, 2018), the Appeal Board cogently explained \nthe relevance of such service on behalf of the United States:  \n \nSuch evidence demonstrates that Applicant has repeatedly been willing to assume a high \nlevel of risk on behalf of the U.S. and shows his ties and sense of obligation to the U.S. \ncould be sufficiently strong enough to support a favorable application of mitigating condition \n8(b). See ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov 14, 2006) (An applicant\u2019s work in \nsupport of U.S. forces in Afghanistan occurred \u201cin the context of dangerous high-risk \ncircumstances in which [he] made a significant contribution to national security.\u201d) See also \nISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 2006); ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 2-3 \n(App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008); and ISCR Case No. 10-02803 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 19, 2012). \n \n52 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-\n3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \n \n\n \n21 \n                                      \n \nseven delinquent accounts that had been placed for collection or charged off, totaling \napproximately $121,161. In an effort to repair his credit, Applicant hired a law firm to simply \ndispute many of his accounts to remove them from his credit reports, without any \nlegitimate basis to do so.  \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. For approximately ten years, Applicant has been supporting his parents with \nvarying monthly payments; when his fianc\u00e9e became pregnant, and thereafter, he paid \nher medical expenses, has been sending her child support, and provided her and his \nminor child with residential support. He was unemployed for a substantial period. While \nApplicant may have delayed addressing his delinquent accounts, following the dismissal \nof the bankruptcy, and before the SOR was issued, he engaged the professional services \nof several different organizations to clean up his financial situation by seeking settlements. \nHe has been paying one organization $1,834 per month, and is anticipated to continue \ndoing so until all of his delinquent debts are resolved. Several accounts have been \nresolved, and others are in the process of being resolved. Applicant\u2019s monthly net salary \nis $8,345, and after monthly expenses and debt payments, he has a monthly remainder \nof $3,720 available for discretionary saving or spending. There is clear evidence that his \nfinancial situation is now under control. Applicant\u2019s loyalty and connections to his fianc\u00e9e \nand minor child currently residing in the Philippines are positive character traits. While the \nforeign influence concerns have been mitigated, once his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s application for a K-1 \nVisa to enter the United States is approved, the foreign influence security concern will \nbecome moot. \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating:53 \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \n                                                          \n53 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). \n \n\n \n22 \n                                      \n \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nApplicant has demonstrated a belated but good track record of debt reduction and \nelimination efforts, finely taking meaningful and documented corrective actions with \nrespect to his delinquent debts. Overall, the evidence leaves me without substantial \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all of these reasons, I conclude that Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising \nfrom his financial considerations and foreign influence concerns. See SEAD 4, App. A, \n\u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.i:  \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.  \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n________________________ \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Corrales, Esq., Department Counsel \n      For Applicant: Alan V. Edmunds, Esq. \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMARSHALL, Jr., Arthur E., Administrative Judge: \n    Statement of the Case \nOn October 16, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign \nInfluence).1 In a notarized response dated November 7, 2017, Applicant admitted all \nallegations and requested a hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). I was assigned this case on June 12, 2018. On \nJune 19, 2018, a notice was issued setting the hearing for August 22, 2018. The \nhearing was convened as scheduled.  \nThe Government offered two documents, which were accepted into the record \nwithout objection as Government exhibits (Exs.) 1-2. Applicant gave testimony and \noffered 14 documents, which were accepted into the record without objection as Exs. A-\nN. Applicant was given through September 1, 2018, to submit any additional \ndocuments. On August 23, 2018, Applicant offered what was accepted without objection \nas Ex. O. A transcript (Tr.) of the proceedings was received on August 31, 2018. The \nrecord was closed on September 1, 2018. After my review of the record as a whole, I \nfind that Applicant mitigated Foreign Influence security concerns. \n1 The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) effective within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017.  \n03/27/2019\n\n \n \n2 \n \n  Request for Administrative Notice  \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout Tunisia. Absent objection, I have taken such notice of the facts contained in the \nrequest. The facts are summarized in the written request and documents, and will not \nbe repeated verbatim in this decision. Of particular note is that Tunisia has problems \naddressing terrorist threats within its borders, has been victimized by terrorism, and has \nhuman rights problems. This is sufficient enough of a problem that U.S. citizens are \nwarned to avoid travel to southeastern Tunisia, along the Libyan border. \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 46-year-old service desk analyst who has worked for the same \nemployer, a defense contractor, for about a year. His salary is approximately $60,000 a \nyear. Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in his native Tunisia and, since moving to \nthe United States, has earned a master\u2019s degree in information systems. He has been \nmarried for over 15 years. The couple has a pre-teen child attending a local school. \nRemaining in Tunisia are several relatives of Applicant: his mother, two brothers, and \nthree sisters, all of whom are citizens and residents of Tunisia.  \n \n \nApplicant immigrated to this country in 1999 from his family\u2019s home in a region \ndistant from the Libyan border of Tunisia. A few years later, he met his wife, moved to \nher state, married, and started a family. Both spouses are established professionals, \nwith Applicant\u2019s hairstylist wife earning between $35,000 and $45,000 per year. They \nare current on their bills and taxes, and saving for their future.  \n \nApplicant owns no property in Tunisia and has no expectation of any inheritance \nbased in Tunisia. Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2013. In 2016, he \nbelieves he formally renounced his Tunisian citizenship by surrendering his Tunisian \npassport to his company. He has not been back to Tunisia in at least three years, when \nhe went to attend his late father\u2019s funeral. (Tr. 30) He ceased sending any money to \nrelatives in Tunisia in 2017, when he discovered it could raise trustworthiness \nconcerns.2 (Tr. 28) He has no bank account abroad. Applicant no longer has a Tunisian \npassport, having submitted it to his security officer in 2018 for destruction; when \ntraveling, he now only uses his U.S. passport. (Tr. 29; Ex. O). .  \n \nIn Tunisia, Applicant\u2019s mother, a homemaker and cancer survivor with recurring \nmedical issues, lives with Applicant\u2019s two older, unmarried, non-working sisters. His \nmother is about 79 years old. Applicant talks to his mother by telephone \u201cnot too often.\u201d \n(Tr. 31) He makes irregular calls to her to check on her health. She does not visit the \nUnited States. Since learning that communication with members of family living in \nforeign countries or family who are citizens of a foreign country may raise security \nconcerns, Applicant has ceased contact and connection with the rest of his family in \nTunisia. (Tr. 31, 46-47)  \n \n                                                          \n2 Earlier, it was not unusual for Applicant to send his mother about $200 about twice a year. (Tr. 53) \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \nApplicant has one brother who is a private business owner and another brother \nwho is a high school teacher, although it is unknown whether he is with a private or \npublic institution. Neither brother has connections with the Tunisian government or \nmilitary. Applicant has had no contact with his brothers or his sisters since their father\u2019s \nearly 2016 funeral.3 He is not aware what, if anything, his third and youngest sister \ndoes, although he is aware she lives apart from his other siblings and is married. None \nof this family knows what Applicant does for a living; they only care that he is \u201cdoing \nfine.\u201d (Tr. 33) \n \nApplicant has no plans to ever return to his family seat in Tunisia or to that \ncountry in general. He noted, \u201cmy country is the United States of America. That is my \ndream since I came here in 1999. . . . All my future is in [sic] here.\u201d (Tr. 35) Applicant is \nhighly respected by colleagues and friends. Currently in a public trust position, Applicant \nhas never been in a situation where he or a family member has been exploited.   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s adjudicative goal is \na fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. Under the AG, the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson in making a decision. The protection of the national security is the paramount \nconsideration. Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.  \n \nUnder the Directive, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \nwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by \napplicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the ultimate burden of persuasion \nto obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government based on trust and confidence that transcends beyond \nnormal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in \nthose to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions include \nconsideration of the possible risk the applicant may fail to safeguard such information.  \n \n                                                          \n3 Applicant had little or no contact with his brothers during his 2016 trip to Tunisia for their father\u2019s funeral. \nHowever, one brother visited the United States in early 2014. (Tr. 55) \n \n\n \n \n4 \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nUnder the AG, foreign contact and interests, including, but not limited to, \nbusiness, financial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they create \ncircumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign \nperson, group, organization, or government in a way inconsistent with U. S. interests or \notherwise be made vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. \nAssessment of foreign contact and interests should consider the country (Philippines) in \nwhich the foreign contact or interest is included.  \n \n \nThe AG lists nine possible disqualifying conditions. Given that Applicant has a \nmother and siblings who are citizens and residents of Tunisia, I find the following apply:  \n \n\u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country, if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \nand  \n \n\u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \nUnder \u00b6 8, two mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n  \n\u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States, and \n \n\u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense \nof loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \n \n \nAs a threshold issue, I noted the information regarding Tunisia incorporated into \nthis analysis above. I considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Tunisia, the nature of \nits government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record, all of \nwhich are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \n\n \n \n5 \n \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is known to \nconduct intelligence operations against the United States, or the foreign country is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \n \nHere, Tunisia is a country of heightened risk, in part because of internal incidents \nof terrorism its government is grappling to contain. This process is thus concerned with \nwhether there is a risk of exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion \nrelated to Applicant\u2019s family in that country. It is specifically noted, however, that there is \nno evidence indicating that its government targets U.S. citizens for economic or \nclassified informational purposes. It is similarly noted that Applicant\u2019s family is far \nremoved from the area to which the U.S. Department of State advises U.S. citizens \nrefrain from travel.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s closeness to his aging and ill mother is demonstrated by his on-going, \nalbeit substantially reduced and infrequent, contact by telephone. She, in turn, is a life-\nlong widow and homemaker, quietly cared for by her two unmarried, non-working \ndaughters. None of them have a known nexus to either a foreign government or military \npower. Applicant intentionally cut off all contact with these siblings once he discovered \nsuch contact could raise security issues. This also includes his youngest sister and his \ntwo brothers, none of whom are known to have a connection with a foreign government \nor military. They all live quiet, unexceptional lives. None of these relations know what \nApplicant does for a living, nor has the topic piqued their interest. By all accounts, they \nlive \u201cunder the radar\u201d in Tunisia, absorbed in their own day-to-day lives. \n \n \nIn contrast, Applicant came to the United States 20 years ago to pursue his \nAmerican dream. He is a loyal U.S. citizen. Here, he met his wife, completed graduate \nschool, married, settled in his community, and started his family. The is raising their \nchild here. With a joint income of about $100,000 a year, Applicant and his wife live well \nwithin their means. He freely chose to disassociate himself from his foreign kin in favor \nof his immediate family here. Applicant expressed his undivided loyalty for the United \nStates, which he considers his home. I find that Applicant\u2019s familial ties to Tunisia are \noutweighed by his deep and long-standing relationships and loyalties in the United \nStates. I find that there is no conflict of interest because he can be expected to resolve \nany conflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(b) is applicable. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n \n6 \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s highly credible \ntestimony and service in a public trust position.  \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude foreign influence \nsecurity concerns are mitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

Foreman, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline E, personal \nconduct. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 13, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline E, personal conduct. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 26, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on December 11, 2018. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on the same \nday. I convened the hearing as scheduled on January 18, 2019. The Government offered \n02/14/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nexhibits (GE) 1 through 7. There were no objections to any exhibits offered, and all were \nadmitted into evidence. Applicant testified and did not offer any exhibits. DOHA received \nthe hearing transcript on January 31, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR with explanations. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 62 years old. He has never married and has no children. He attended \na trade school for four years and attended college for two years, but did not earn a degree. \nHe enlisted in the military, but after a short period he was honorably discharged due to \nmedical reasons. He has worked for government contractors at different times in the \npast.1  \n \nApplicant disagreed with the hiring practices of his employer (Employer #1). In \napproximately September 2016, he believed he was asked to do a job he was not hired \nfor. He went to the personnel office and complained. He claimed that personnel at the \ncompany did not like him criticizing them for what he believed were inappropriate work \npractices. He explained a manager had asked him if he liked working there and Applicant \nresponded that it was acceptable. Applicant stated: \n \nAnd at that time, the black guy walked up, and I guess he thought I was \ntalking about him. And they marched off, and that\u2019s when, I guess, that-- \nwhen he decided to fire me. But I didn\u2019t \u2013 like I said, they didn\u2019t like me \nhaving meetings with them and expressing what I felt. It seems like a lot of \nmanagers, they\u2019re job scared, and they want cheap, Bosnians or Indians or \nAfricans working for them, because they can pay them $3-or $400 every \ntwo weeks or whatever. And they don\u2019t bitch and they don\u2019t bellyache; they \nwill not challenge you.2 \n \n* * * \n \nAnd that\u2019s what really stuck in their craw is whenever I had meetings with \nthem about this. You know, I hired in to do a specific job. Our soldiers \ndeserve English-speaking, licensed American craftsman.3 \n \n \nApplicant testified that he was accused of insubordination by the manager. He \ndenied it. He stated he received a letter \u201csomething about behavior\u201d and verbal \nharassment. He said the managers can make up any reason to fire you. He said if you \n                                                          \n1 Tr. 16-18. \n \n2 Tr. 23. \n \n3 Tr. 23. \n\n \n3 \n \n \ndisagree with them they get angry. The letter notified him of his termination.4 Applicant\u2019s \ntermination letter from Employer #1 stated: \n \nYour employment is terminated because you violated several discipline \npolicies including failure to comply with [employer\u2019s] Code of Ethics and \nBusiness Conduct. You violated [employer\u2019s] Harassment-Free Workplace \npolicy by engaging in verbal harassment or other abusive conduct, including \nbullying, tormenting, aggressive, and/or tyrannizing behavior. You violated \n[employer\u2019s] Workplace Security by not maintaining a safe and respectful \nworkplace by engaging in threatening, frightening, coercive, and/or violent \nbehavior. You also violated employment addendum, Section 24.2, by not \ncomplying with all [employer\u2019s] standards of business conduct, ethics, \nsecurity, and health and safety rules and directives.5 \n \n \nDuring Applicant\u2019s January 2017 background interview, he told the government \ninvestigator that he was told by his manager that he was sent home from his employment \nfor being a bully. No further amplification about his conduct was provided by Applicant.6  \n \n \nApplicant was terminated from employment in October 2004 by Employer #2 for \nengaging in a physical altercation with another employee, in violation of company policy.7 \nApplicant testified he disagreed with another employee\u2019s work product and engaged in a \nphysical altercation with the employee. He explained that his concerns were about safety. \nHe was asked by his manager if he knew why he was being fired, and Applicant stated it \nwas because of his concerns about safety. He then said the manager told him he was \nfired for fighting.8  \n \n \nApplicant testified that he was rehired by Employer #2 several years later. As part \nof the hiring practice, the employer asked him to provide a resume. Applicant failed to list \non his resume his previous employment with Employer #2. He testified that he did not \nhave an explanation for why the resume did not include his previous employment with \nEmployer #2.9  \n \n                                                          \n4 Tr. 20-26; GE 3, 4. \n \n5 GE 4. \n \n6 GE 3. \n \n7 GE 5. \n \n8 Tr. 26-33. \n \n9 Tr. 52-59; GE 6. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in October 2010. In it \nhe failed to disclose, as was required, he had been fired by Employer #2 for fighting.10 He \nexplained \u201cWell, you know, I feel like I got screwed over on those jobs, and I judge\u2014I \ndon\u2019t\u2019 know. I just put finished, done with it, you know.\u201d11 He further explained \u201cI was fired, \nbut the reason why I got fired, I feel like, were unjust.\u201d12 \n \n \nApplicant completed another SCA in February 2016. In response to questions in \nSection 13A about his employment history, he stated he left his job with Employer #2 in \nDecember 2005 because the job was finished, which was not true. He was fired by \nEmployer #2 in October 2004 for a physical altercation.13  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s provided the following explanation for providing false information on his \n2016 SCA.   \n \nI put down, [f]inished, instead of fight. I was finished because whenever I \nthink about the situation and how I was trying to defend my integrity\u2014a lot \nof soldiers were getting electrocuted back in the\u2014when they was taking \nshowers . . . .\u201d14 \n \nHe then stated: \u201cI don\u2019t know what it was. Fired, quit, finished, resigned. I don\u2019t remember \nwhat it was. But, yes, I was fired.\u201d15 He further explained:  \n \n \nWell, I was thinking about it, and I was hacked off because I got screwed \nover, trying to do the right thing. I could have got\u2014that was a $100,000 a \nyear job. Okay? When it comes to integrity or doing something funny, you \ncan\u2019t be bought. Some people mostly get bought. They\u2019re job scared or \nhouse note or family or whatever. Integrity\u2019s integrity, period.16 \n \n \nDuring Applicant\u2019s January 2017 interview with a government investigator he was \nquestioned about his employment with Employer #2. Applicant stated that he did not know \nwhy he did not disclose that he was fired and indicated that maybe it was because he \n                                                          \n10 Tr. 50GE 2. Any derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered for \ndisqualifying purposes, but may be considered when applying mitigating conditions, when making a \ncredibility determination, and in the whole-person analysis.  \n \n11 Tr. 50. \n \n12 Tr. 50. \n \n13 GE 1. \n \n14 Tr. 46. \n \n15 Tr. 48. \n \n16 Tr. 48. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nmisread the question.17 I find Applicant deliberately provided false information on his 2016 \nSCA when he stated that he left his employment with Employer #2 in December 2005 \nbecause the job had finished, when in fact he was terminated in 2004 for fighting.  \n \n \nIn April 2015, Applicant was charged with assault after he hit a salesman at a car \ndealership because he believed the engine in the used van he purchased was bad. \nApplicant explained that he decided to purchase a used van. He test drove it and had his \nmechanic examine it. His mechanic told him it \u201chad a slight miss.\u201d18 Applicant then \npurchased the vehicle. He then took it back to the mechanic and it was determined that \nthere was a problem with a cylinder, which was an expensive repair. Applicant claimed a \nperson at the dealership agreed to share the cost of the repair and then did not. He \nconfronted the salesman and asked \u201cWhere\u2019s my money.\u201d Applicant then hit the salesman \nin the face. Applicant was charged with assault. He said he received a letter from the \ndistrict attorney that the charge was dismissed because witnesses would not cooperate.19  \n \n \nApplicant filed a suit in small claims court against the car dealership. He said: \u201cI \nexplained to the Judge, a verbal agreement made in good faith is just as binding as a \nsigned contract, period.\u201d20 The Judge disagreed with Applicant\u2019s interpretation of the law \nand ruled in favor of the dealership. Applicant was unhappy and frustrated. He testified at \nhis security clearance hearing as follows: \n \nAdministrative Judge: You hit the guy? \n \nApplicant: Yes. I slapped him. Yes. \n \nAdministrative Judge: And that\u2019s okay? \n \nApplicant: When somebody lies to you\u2014 \n \nAdministrative Judge: You get to hit them? \n \nApplicant: Well, we\u2019re not computers. We are \u2013 \n \nAdministrative Judge: I am asking you. We\u2019re also civilized human beings, so you hit this \nperson. \n \nApplicant: I will protect my home. \n \nAdministrative Judge: Okay. This wasn\u2019t your home. \n                                                          \n17 GE 3. \n \n18 Tr. 33. \n \n19 GE 7; Tr. 33-40. \n \n20 Tr. 36.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant: I will protect my integrity. I will protect whatever\u2014you know, I\u2019m not\u2014 \n \nAdministrative Judge: And the way you choose to do that is by assaulting somebody? \n \nApplicant: Well, whenever somebody lies to me or tries to cheat me. \n \nAdministrative Judge: Okay. So but\u2014 \n \nApplicant: People don\u2019t \u2013there\u2019s a lot of bad people out there. There are a lot of bad \npeople.  \n \nAdministrative Judge: I agree. \n \nApplicant: And if nobody respects you, you know, then you have to ---it\u2019s all about respect.  \n \nAdministrative Judge: Okay. And so\u2014 \n \nApplicant: It\u2019s about being civil. \n \nAdministrative Judge: And being civil is assaulting someone because you disagree with \nthem.  \n \nApplicant: I didn\u2019t disagree with them. I was cheated.  \n \nAdministrative Judge: Okay. You went to court, and you lost. \n \nApplicant: Huh? \n \nAdministrative Judge: You went to court and you lost. \n \nApplicant: Well, that\u2019s beside the ---well, the point is, I was cheated. \n \nAdministrative Judge: All right. \n \nApplicant: I know I was cheated. Nobody else was there except me. I have to preserve\u2014\nit\u2019s just the same thing as electrical or whatever. I have to preserve an integrity. \n \nAdministrative Judge: Okay. \n \nApplicant: Boundaries, respect. It\u2019s about about\u2014that\u2019s what all of this is about. \n \nAdministrative Judge: And do you respect the law? \n \nApplicant: Yes. I didn\u2019t break the law. The point is\u2014 \n \nAdministrative Judge: Well\u2014 \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant: Well, the point\u2014I understand what you\u2014 \n \nAdministrative Judge: No, no. Assaulting people is breaking the law.  \n \nApplicant: There\u2019s reasons for\u2014there are reasons for--- \n \nAdministrative Judge: No reason justifies you assaulting someone because you disagree \nwith them. \n \nApplicant: No. If somebody comes into my house, do you think I\u2019m going to just sit there \nand let somebody\u2014if somebody comes and and \u2013 \n \nAdministrative Judge: I didn\u2019t say that. \n \nApplicant: steals something.  \n \nAdministrative Judge: Okay. Go ahead. Finish what you want to tell me. Go ahead.  \n \nApplicant: I already forgot what I was even talking \u2013 \n \nAdministrative Judge: Well, you were cheated, and you\u2014 \n \nApplicant: Yes. \n \nAdministrative Judge: decided that you needed to assault him, because you were- \n \nApplicant: No. I decided to provide\u2014 \n \nAdministrative Judge: protecting your integrity. \n \nApplicant: motivation for them to keep\u2014to be honest. \n \nAdministrative Judge: Okay. And the motivation is hitting them? \n \nApplicant: Because they didn\u2019t pay me.  \n \nAdministrative Judge: Okay.21  \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \n                                                          \n21 Tr. 33-45. \n\n \n8 \n \n \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwilling to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information;  \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other \nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, \nbut which, when combined with all available information, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This includes, but is \nnot limited to, considerations of: . . . (2) any disruptive, violent, or other \ninappropriate behavior; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nApplicant was terminated from his job by Employer #2 in 2004 for fighting. He \ndeliberately provided false information on his SCA when he stated he left the job in \nDecember 2005 because the job was finished. Applicant was fired from his job by \nEmployer #1 in about September 2016 for violating his employer\u2019s workplace \nharassment-free workplace policy when he engaged in verbal harassment or other \nabusive conduct. He violated his employer\u2019s security policy by not maintaining a safe and \nrespectful workplace. In 2015, Applicant assaulted a salesman by hitting him in the face. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom personal conduct. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n17: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nApplicant\u2019s testimony lacked candor and was not believable. He failed to make a \nprompt, good-faith effort to correct his false statement on his 2016 SCA and disclose he \nhad been fired from his job in 2004. His justifications for why he did not disclose the truth \nraise serious concerns about his trustworthiness, reliability, and judgment. AG \u00b6 17(a) \ndoes not apply. \n \nApplicant repeatedly acted out aggressively or violently in the workplace and when \nhe was unhappy as a consumer. Fighting in the workplace, exhibiting aggressive or \noffensive conduct towards coworkers, and hitting someone in the face when he was \nunhappy and frustrated with a purchase are not minor and show a pattern of questionable \nself-control and conduct. Applicant failed to take responsibility for any of his actions. I \ncannot find that similar conduct is unlikely to recur. I find his conduct casts doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \n\n \n11 \n \n \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 62 years old. He has a history of acting aggressively and \ninappropriately in the workplace. He believes he is entitled to use violence to motivate \npeople to act as he believes is appropriate. He repeatedly justifies his actions because \nhe is defending his integrity. Applicant\u2019s misguided interpretation of appropriate conduct, \nboth physical and verbal; his deliberate falsification on his 2016 SCA; his failure to \ndisclose his termination from his job on his 2010 SCA; and his failure to disclose on his \nresume a period of employment that might have been detrimental to his hiring, show a \npattern of deception, dishonesty, and questionable judgment. His conduct casts doubt on \nhis reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. The record evidence leaves me with \nserious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline E, personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nHistory of the Case \nOn August 1, 2017, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit \n(GE) 1) On October 31, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under \nExecutive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, \nFebruary 20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017.   \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n12/27/2018\n\n \n2                                                                                                                                             \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under the foreign influence and \npersonal conduct guidelines. \n \nOn January 20, 2018, and February 15, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR \nand requested a hearing. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 4) On April 25, 2018, Department \nCounsel was ready to proceed. On July 23, 2018, the case was assigned to me. On \nAugust 31, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice \nof hearing, setting the hearing for September 14, 2018. (HE 2) Applicant waived his \nright to 15 days of notice of the date, time, and location of the hearing. (Tr. 9-10) \nApplicant\u2019s hearing was held as scheduled using video teleconference.  \n  \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered five exhibits; Applicant did not    \nprovide any documents; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were \nadmitted into evidence. (Transcript (Tr.) 9, 13, 15; GE 1-5) On September 24, 2018, \nDOHA received a transcript of the hearing.  \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \nDepartment Counsel offered summaries for administrative notice concerning \nforeign influence security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s connections to Iraq. Applicant \ndid not object to me taking administrative notice of facts concerning Iraq, and I granted \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s motion. Department Counsel and Applicant indicated they had \nno objection to me taking administrative notice of facts from the U.S. Department of \nState website concerning Iraq.1 Administrative or official notice is the appropriate type of \nnotice used for administrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 16-02522 at 2-3 (App. \nBd. July 12, 2017); ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n. 1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR \nCase No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd.

Usually administrative notice at ISCR proceedings is \naccorded to facts that are either well known or from government reports. See Stein, \nADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for \nadministrative notice).  \n \nPortions of the Department Counsel\u2019s requests are quoted without quotation \nmarks and footnotes in the Iraq sections of this decision, infra.

(HE 4) \nHe also provided mitigating information. (HE 4) His admissions are incorporated herein \nas findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I \nmake the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old linguist, and DOD contractors have previously \nemployed him for several years in Iraq. (Tr. 5, 20) In 1980, he was born in Iraq, and in \n1997, he emigrated from Iraq to the United States.

(Tr. 17-\n18) He married in Iraq, and he and his spouse went to the United States in July 2008. \n(Tr. 19) His spouse spent about 12 months in Iraq with her family in the period from \nApril 2009 to March 2011. (Tr. 19) From April 2012 to September 2013, Applicant and \nhis family lived in Iraq, and Applicant worked for a private Iraqi company in security.  (Tr. \n20-21) From March to June 2015, Applicant worked in Iraq as a linguist. (Tr. 22) In \n2017, Applicant, his wife, and children went to Iraq for a couple of months to visit family \nand friends. (Tr. 22, 47) He stayed with his mother. (Tr. 44) \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, father, three brothers, four sisters, mother-in-law, father-in-\nlaw, four brothers-in-law, and one sister-in-law are citizens and residents of Iraq. (Tr. \n23-30; SOR response \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.h) His parents are divorced. (Tr. 23) His father served as \nan officer in the Iraqi military for about 11 years. (Tr. 23-24) His father is retired, and he \nreceives rent from properties he owns. (Tr. 25) Applicant provided about $10,000 to \n$12,000 annually in financial support for his mother. (Tr. 23, 43) Now he provides about \n$2,000 annually to her. (Tr. 45) He has acquaintances or his uncles deliver the funds to \nher in increments of about $500. (Tr. 44) One of his brothers lives in the United States. \n(Tr. 25) Two of his brothers in Iraq are police officers. (Tr. 26) None of his other siblings \nor in-laws are employed by the Iraqi government. (Tr. 23-30) In the past he provided \n$5,000 or $6,000 in financial support to his siblings. (Tr. 48) \n \nIn 2008, Applicant purchased property in Iraq, and he values that property at \nabout $80,000. (Tr. 30, 50-51; SOR \u00b6 1.i) Applicant\u2019s net worth in the United States \nincluding his equity in his house is about $250,000. (Tr. 49) In addition to his spouse \nand three children, he has two uncles, one brother, and about 20 cousins living in the \nUnited States. (Tr. 52) \n                                            \n2 The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of witnesses, names \nof other groups, or locations in order to protect Applicant and his family\u2019s privacy. The cited sources \ncontain more specific information. \n\n \n4                                                                                                                                             \nApplicant communicates with his father, mother, and siblings on about a monthly \nbasis. (Tr. 45-46) His spouse communicates with her family in Iraq on a daily or almost \ndaily basis. (Tr. 46-47)  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nIn May 2015, Applicant was terminated as a linguist from his employment for \nleaving his post or site without authorization. (Tr. 31; SOR response \u00b6 2.a) Applicant \nbelieved he was not needed at his site, and he left to visit his spouse and children, who \nlived about 90 minutes away by car. (Tr. 32) He did not have permission to leave the \nsite. (Tr. 32) He said a sergeant said he could do whatever he wanted to do because \nthe cameras used for their mission were down. (Tr. 33) This was the first time he left a \nsite in Iraq without permission. (Tr. 34) He believed that if he asked for permission, it \nwould be refused. (Tr. 35) When he left in the afternoon, he intended to return early the \nnext morning. (Tr. 35) About 9:30 PM, the battalion sergeant major from the site called \nApplicant and asked him to come back the night he left; however, Applicant waited until \nthe next morning to return. (Tr. 36-38) Applicant said he did not remember anyone \ntelling him he had to have permission to travel off-site for personal or unofficial reasons. \n(Tr. 41-42) Applicant conceded that he should have asked permission before leaving \nthe site. (Tr. 38) He returned the next morning, and he was informed he was terminated \nfrom his employment. (Tr. 39) \n \n \nThe day Applicant left the site without permission, he called his wife about 1:00 \nPM, and he knew that she was released from the hospital where she was treated for \nstomach flu the night before he left the site. (Tr. 36, 52-53) Despite knowing his wife \nwas not in the hospital and it was not a medical emergency, Applicant left the site about \n3:00 PM without permission. (Tr. 32-38, 53) \n \nApplicant\u2019s statement in the security incident report relating to his unauthorized \ndeparture from the site states that around 2:00 PM his sister-in-law called and said his \n\u201cwife was rushed to the Emergency room so at that time I was really shocked and \nworried about my wife because that was the second time she had been hospitalized that \nsame week.\u201d (GE 2) So he left the base so he \u201ccould go to the hospital to see [his] wife.\u201d \n(GE 2) He said he would not have left the site \u201cif it wasn\u2019t an emergency.\u201d (GE 2) On \nJanuary 20, 2018, he resubmitted the statement about his spouse\u2019s medical emergency \nas an attachment to a text indicating it described \u201cexactly what happened.\u201d (SOR \nresponse)3 \n                                            \n3 Applicant\u2019s SOR does not allege that Applicant made a false statement in response to the \nsecurity incident report and SOR about his spouse being in the hospital for emergency treatment. In ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which \nconduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  \n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s evidence of \nextenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant \nhas demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of \nthe Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person \nanalysis under Directive Section 6.3.  \n \n\n \n5                                                                                                                                             \n \nApplicant questioned the fairness of reporting the May 2015 security incident in \nsecurity channels because he did \u201cnot breach[] any security or put anybody\u2019s life in \ndanger.\u201d (Tr. 39) He admitted he made mistakes; however, he insisted that he would \nconscientiously protect security and classified information. (Tr. 57-58) \n \nIraq \n \nThe U.S. Mission in Iraq remains dedicated to building a strategic partnership \nwith Iraq and the Iraqi people. The December 2011 departure of U.S. troops from Iraq \nmarked a milestone in our relationship as Iraq continues to develop as a sovereign, \nstable, and self-reliant country. Iraq is now a key partner for the U.S. in the region as \nwell as a voice of moderation and democracy in the Middle East. Iraq has functioning \ngovernment institutions including an active legislature, is playing an increasingly \nconstructive role in the region, and has a bright economic future as oil revenues surpass \npre-Saddam production levels with continued rapid growth to come. The U.S. maintains \nvigorous and broad engagement with Iraq on diplomatic, political, economic, and \nsecurity issues in accordance with the U.S.-Iraq Strategic Framework Agreement. \n \nThe Strategic Framework Agreement (SFA) between Iraq and the U.S. provides \nthe basis for the U.S.-Iraq bilateral relationship. It covers the range of bilateral issues \nincluding political relations and diplomacy, defense and security, trade and finance, \nenergy, judicial and law enforcement issues, services, science, culture, education, and \nenvironment. Efforts to implement the SFA are overseen by the Higher Coordinating \nCommittee and several Joint Coordination Committees, which meet periodically. \n \nThe U.S. State Department warns that U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk for \nviolence and kidnapping, and advises U.S. citizens not to travel to Iraq. The current \ntravel advisory level is Level 4: Do not travel.  \n \nThe ability of the U.S. Embassy to provide consular services to U.S. citizens \noutside Baghdad is limited given the security environment. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias \nmay threaten U.S. citizens and western companies throughout Iraq. Kidnappings and \nattacks by improvised explosive devices (IED) occur in many areas of the country, \nincluding Baghdad. Methods of attack have included explosively formed penetrators \n(EFPs), magnetic IEDs placed on vehicles, human and vehicle-borne IEDs, mines \nplaced on or concealed near roads, mortars and rockets, and shootings using various \ndirect fire weapons. Such attacks may take place in public venues such as cafes and \nmarkets.  \n \nIraq witnessed continued terrorist activity in 2016, primarily as a result of the \nactions of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIL). In 2016, ISIL remained the greatest \nterrorist threat globally, maintaining a formidable force in Syria, including a large number \nof foreign terrorist fighters. ISIL\u2019s capacity and territorial control in Iraq has dramatically \neroded in the past two years. According to estimates from the UN Assistance Mission \n                                                                                                                                            \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. \nOct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd.

Oct. 26, 2006)). \nThis conduct will not be considered except for the five purposes listed above. \n\n \n6                                                                                                                                             \nfor Iraq, acts of terrorism and violence killed more than 7,000 civilians and injured more \nthan 12,000 in 2016. By the end of 2017, Iraqi Security Forces had liberated all territory \nfrom ISIL, drastically reducing ISIL\u2019s ability to commit abuses and atrocities. Human \nrights violations continue to be a problem with allegations of unlawful killings and other \nabuses being made against the Iraqi Security Forces and Popular Mobilization Forces.  \n \nIn its annual human rights report, the U.S. Department of State reported that \nsevere human rights problems were widespread. Sectarian hostility, widespread \ncorruption, and lack of transparency at all levels of government and society weakened \nthe government's authority and worsened effective human rights protections. Iraqi \nSecurity Forces, members of the Federal Police, and the Peshmerga committed some \nhuman rights violations, and there continued to be reports of Popular Mobilization \nForces killing, torturing, kidnapping, and extorting civilians. ISIL committed the \noverwhelming majority of serious human rights abuses, including attacks against: \ncivilians, (particularly Shia but also Sunnis who opposed ISIL); members of other \nreligious and ethnic minorities; women; and children. \n \nObservers also reported other significant human rights-related problems: harsh \nand life-threatening conditions in detention and prison facilities; arbitrary arrest and \nlengthy pretrial detention, denial of fair public trial; insufficient judicial institutional \ncapacity; ineffective implementation of civil judicial procedures and remedies; arbitrary \ninterference with privacy and homes; child soldiers; limits on freedom of expression, \nincluding press freedoms; violence against and harassment of journalists; undue \ncensorship; social, religious, and political restrictions in academic and cultural matters; \nlimits on freedoms of peaceful assembly and association; limits on religious freedom \ndue to violence by extremist groups; restrictions on freedom of movement; refugee and \ninternally displaced persons (IDP) abuse; both forced IDP returns and preventing IDPs \nfrom returning home; discrimination against and societal abuse of women and ethnic, \nreligious, and racial minorities, including exclusion from decision-making roles; \ntrafficking in persons; societal discrimination and violence against lesbian, gay, \nbisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) persons; seizure of property without due \nprocess; and limitations on worker rights. \n \nThe United States\u2019 extraordinary commitment to Iraq is balanced against the \ninherent dangers of the ongoing conflict in Iraq to its citizens and residents and Iraq \ngovernment problems developing and complying with the rule of law. A top national \nsecurity goal of the United States is to establish relationships, cooperation, training, and \nsupport of the Iraq Government and military in the ongoing war against terrorism. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \n\n \n7                                                                                                                                             \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision should \nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any \nexpress or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is \nmerely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President,  \nSecretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \n     \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \n\n \n8                                                                                                                                             \nAnalysis \n \n Foreign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 has four conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business that could \nsubject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation or personal conflict of interest.   \nApplicant admitted that his mother, father, three brothers, four sisters, mother-in-\nlaw, father-in-law, four brothers-in-law, and one sister-in-law are citizens and residents \nof Iraq. In 2008, Applicant purchased property in Iraq, and that property is valued at \nabout $80,000.  \n \n\n \n9                                                                                                                                             \nApplicant has frequent contact with his family living in Iraq. Applicant and his \nspouse were born in Iraq, and she has frequent contact with her family in Iraq. His and \nhis spouse\u2019s frequent contacts with relatives in Iraq are manifestations of their care and \nconcern for relatives living in that country.  \n \nWhen an allegation under a disqualifying condition is established, \u201cthe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct or \ncircumstances . . . and an applicant\u2019s security [or trustworthiness] eligibility. Direct or \nobjective evidence of nexus is not required.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 17-00507 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJune 13, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)). \n \nThere are widely documented safety issues for residents of Iraq primarily \nbecause of terrorists and insurgents. Applicant has voluntarily shared in those dangers \non behalf of the DOD, and he is willing to do so in the future. Numerous linguists, \nsupporting U.S. forces, have family living in Iraq. Hundreds of United States and \ncoalition armed forces and civilian contractors serving in Iraq are targets of terrorists, \nalong with Iraqi civilians and soldiers who support the Iraqi government and cooperate \nwith coalition forces.  \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with relatives living in Iraq is not, as a \nmatter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an applicant or his or her \nspouse has such a relationship with even one person living in a foreign country, this \nfactor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially \nresult in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 08-02864 at 4-5 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2009) (discussing problematic visits of applicant\u2019s father to Iran).4  \n \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, his or her immediate family members, and this presumption includes in-\nlaws. ISCR Case No. 07-06030 at 3 (App. Bd. June 19, 2008); ISCR Case No. 05-\n00939 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 3, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. \n20, 2002).    \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has indicated for Guideline B cases, \u201cthe nature of the \nforeign government involved and the intelligence-gathering history of that government \nare among the important considerations that provide context for the other record \nevidence and must be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case. \nThe country\u2019s human rights record is another important consideration.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n16-02435 at 3 (May 15, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-00528 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 13, \n2017)). Another significant consideration is the nature of a nation\u2019s government\u2019s \nrelationship with the United States. These factors are relevant in assessing the \nlikelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members living in that country are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion or inducement.  \n \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, the government ignores the rule of law \n                                            \n4 In accordance with \u201cwell established DoD policy [Applicant and his family\u2019s] religious affiliation \nplay[ed] no part\u201d in this decision. ISCR Case No. 08-06795 at 6 n. 3 (App. Bd. May 25, 2012). \n\n \n10                                                                                                                                           \nincluding widely accepted civil liberties, a family member is associated with or \ndependent upon the government, the government is engaged in a counterinsurgency, \nterrorists cause a substantial amount of death or property damage, or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence collection operations against the United States. The \nrelationship of Iraq with the United States, and the situation in that country places a \nsignificant burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationship with \nany family member living in or visiting that country does not pose a trustworthiness or \nsecurity risk. Applicant should not be placed into a position where he might be forced to \nchoose between loyalty to the United States and a desire to assist a relative living in or \nvisiting Iraq.5  \n \nGuideline B security or trustworthiness concerns are not limited to countries \nhostile to the United States. \u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting \nand safeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or country that is \nnot authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or \ncountry has interests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 \nat 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound \ndisagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to their vital \ninterests or national security. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in \nespionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and \ntechnical fields. See ISCR Case No. 02-22461, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 1570 at *11-*12 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-26976 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, \n2004)) (discussing Taiwan). \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives, criminals, or terrorists \nfrom or in Iraq seek or have sought classified or economic information from or through \nApplicant or his family, nevertheless, it is not prudent to rule out such a possibility in the \nfuture. International terrorist groups are known to conduct intelligence activities as \neffectively as capable state intelligence services, and Iraq has a significant problem with \nterrorism. Applicant\u2019s family in Iraq \u201ccould be a means through which Applicant comes \nto the attention of those who seek U.S. information or technology and who would \nattempt to exert coercion upon him.\u201d ADP Case No. 14-01655 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 9, \n2015) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-02950 at 3 (App. Bd. May 14, 2015)).  \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with relatives who are living in Iraq or visiting that \ncountry create a potential conflict of interest because terrorists could place pressure on \n                                            \n5 The Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 03-24933, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 346 at *20-*21 n. 18 (App. \nBd. 2005), explained how relatives in a foreign country have a security significance: \n \nThe issue under Guideline B is not whether an applicant\u2019s immediate family members in \na foreign country are of interest to a foreign power based on their prominence or personal \nsituation. Rather, the issue is whether an applicant\u2019s ties and contacts with immediate \nfamily members in a foreign country raise security [or trustworthiness] concerns because \nthose ties and contacts create a potential vulnerability that a foreign power could seek to \nexploit in an effort to get unauthorized access to U.S. classified information that an \napplicant -- not the applicant\u2019s immediate family members -- has by virtue of a security \nclearance [or public trust position]. A person may be vulnerable to influence or pressure \nexerted on, or through, the person\u2019s immediate family members -- regardless of whether \nthe person\u2019s family members are prominent or not. \n\n \n11                                                                                                                                           \nhis family in Iraq in an effort to cause Applicant to compromise classified information. \nThese relationships create \u201ca heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion\u201d under AG \u00b6 7. Department Counsel produced substantial \nevidence of Applicant\u2019s relationships with family in Iraq and has raised the issue of \npotential foreign pressure or attempted exploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), 7(e), and 7(f) \napply, and further inquiry is necessary about potential application of any mitigating \nconditions.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for \nproving the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \n\n \n12                                                                                                                                           \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n  \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant presented some important \nmitigating information.  Applicant has \u201cdeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties \nin the U.S.\u201d Applicant resided in the United States since 1997, except when he was in \nIraq.6 Applicant, his spouse, and his three children are citizens of the United States. He \nand his spouse swore an oath of allegiance to the United States as part of the \ncitizenship process. He has property in the United States valued at about $250,000. \nMost importantly, he served as a linguist in Iraq supporting U.S. goals in that country.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s support to the DOD in Iraq as a linguist and cultural advisor, including \nthe dangers that service entailed, weigh towards mitigating security concerns. Applicant \nseeks a security clearance to enable him to continue serving in Iraq providing critical \nassistance to U.S. Armed Forces in a dangerous combat environment. He has offered \nto continue to risk his life to support the United States\u2019 goals in Iraq. He has shown his \npatriotism, loyalty, and fidelity to the United States during his support to DOD while \nserving in Iraq.  \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 17-00629 at 4 (App. Bd. May 24, 2018), the Appeal Board \ncogently explained the relevance of such service on behalf of the United States: \n \nSuch evidence demonstrates that Applicant has repeatedly been willing to \nassume a high level of risk on behalf of the U.S. and shows his ties and \nsense of obligation to the U.S. could be sufficiently strong enough to \nsupport a favorable application of mitigating condition 8(b). See ISCR \nCase No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov 14, 2006) (An applicant\u2019s work in \nsupport of U.S. forces in Afghanistan occurred \u201cin the context of \ndangerous high-risk circumstances in which [he] made a significant \ncontribution to national security.\u201d) See also ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 \n                                            \n6 ISCR Case No. 17-00629 (App. Bd. May 24, 2018) the Appeal Board discussed a translator\u2019s \nmultiple tours on behalf of the United States in Iraq, limited time as a resident in the United States, and \nconnections to family living in Iraq. The Appeal Board stated: \n     \nIn general, an applicant\u2019s deployment to a combat zone in support of U.S. forces is not a \nfactor that weighs against his or her national security eligibility. On the contrary, such \ndeployments tend to establish various mitigating conditions such as [Directive] \u00b6 8(b) \n(\u201cthere is no conflict of interest . . . because . . . the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding loyalties in the United States, that the individual can be expected to resolve \nany conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest\u201d); [Directive] \u00b6 8(d) (\u201cthe foreign . . . \nactivities are on U.S. Government business\u201d); and [Directive] \u00b6 8(f) (\u201cthe value or routine \nnature of the foreign business . . . is such that [it is] unlikely to result in a conflict of \ninterest and could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual.\u201d) \n \nId. at 3 (internal footnotes omitted) (remanding administrative judge\u2019s denial of security clearance). \n\n \n13                                                                                                                                           \n(App. Bd. Jul. 14, 2006); ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Feb. \n5, 2008); and ISCR Case No. 10-02803 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 19, 2012).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s connections to Iraq are substantial and ongoing. He and his spouse \nhave frequent contacts with their relatives, who are citizens and residents of Iraq. He \nprovides financial support to his mother. From April 2012 to September 2013, Applicant \nand his family returned to Iraq, and Applicant worked for a private Iraqi company in \nsecurity. When Applicant went to Iraq in 2015 to work as a linguist, he took his family \nwith him, and he left his work site without permission resulting in termination of his \nemployment as a translator. In 2017, he and his family went to Iraq for two months to \nvisit family and friends.  He retains property in Iraq that he values at about $80,000. \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United States must be weighed against the \npotential conflict of interest created by his relationships with relatives who are citizens \nand residents of Iraq. His and his spouse\u2019s families reside in Iraq. Like every other \nresident of Iraq, they are at risk from criminals, terrorists, and human rights violations of \nthe Iraqi government. \n \nIt is important to be mindful of the United States\u2019 huge historical investment of \nmanpower and money in Iraq, and Applicant has supported U.S. goals and objectives in \nIraq. Applicant and his family living in Iraq are potential targets of terrorists, and \nApplicant\u2019s potential access to classified information could theoretically add risk to his \nrelatives living in that country from lawless elements in Iraq.   \n \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s connections to his relatives living in Iraq are substantial. His \nconnections to the United States taken together are insufficient to overcome the foreign \ninfluence security concerns under Guideline B.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 articulates the security concern for personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n \nAG \u00b6 16 lists one personal conduct condition that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case including: \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \n\n \n14                                                                                                                                           \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: (1) untrustworthy or \nunreliable behavior . . . . \n \n \nIn May 2015, Applicant was terminated as a linguist from his employment for \nleaving his post or site without authorization. Applicant admitted he did not ask for \npermission to leave because he believed his request would be denied. His violation of \nsecurity protocols placed his own life at risk, and if U.S. or coalition forces needed to \nrescue him, their lives would also be at risk. His violation of security rules had the \npotential of placing his family in danger. AG \u00b6 16(d) is established requiring additional \ninquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \n \nFour personal conduct mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially \napplicable in this case:  \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s violation of a security rule \nhad the potential to endanger the lives of himself, his family, and coalition forces. If \nhostile forces captured Applicant, coalition forces may have been deployed to rescue \nhim. His termination of employment as a linguist occurred because of his misconduct. \nHis statement at his hearing that his spouse was not in the hospital conflicts with his \nstatement made in response to the security inquiry and his response to the SOR. His \nviolation of a security rule is recent, serious, and not mitigated.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n15                                                                                                                                           \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under \nGuidelines B and C are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old linguist, and DOD contractors have previously \nemployed him for several years in Iraq. In 1980, he was born in Iraq, and in 1997, he \nemigrated from Iraq to the United States. In 2007, he became a U.S. citizen. In 2013, \nhis spouse became a U.S. citizen, and their three children were born in the United \nStates. He and his spouse took the oath of allegiance to the United States when they \nbecame U.S. citizens. His employment and most of his assets are located in the United \nStates.  \n \nApplicant served as a linguist, translator, or cultural advisor in Iraq. He made \ncontributions at personal risk on behalf of U.S. combat forces in Iraq. All these \ncircumstances increase the probability that Applicant will recognize, resist, and report \nany attempts by a foreign power, terrorist group, or insurgent group to coerce or exploit \nhim. See ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008). His past honorable \nservice as a linguist weighs heavily towards mitigating of foreign influence security \nconcerns. See ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008) (affirming grant of \nsecurity clearance and commenting \u201cApplicant has served as a translator and as a \ncultural liaison between Americans and Afghan citizens, diffusing tensions and \nfacilitating transactions between the two groups. . . . Applicant put his life in danger on \nat least one occasion to protect American lives and interests in Afghanistan.\u201d). \n \nA Guideline B decision concerning Iraq must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation and dangers there.7 Iraq is a dangerous place because of violence \nfrom terrorists, and the Iraqi government does not respect the full spectrum of human \nrights. Terrorists continue to threaten the Iraqi government, the interests of the United \nStates, U.S. Armed Forces, and those who cooperate and assist the United States. The \nUnited States and Iraqi governments are allies in the war on terrorism. \n                                            \n7 See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd. May 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient \ndiscussion of geopolitical situation and suggesting expansion of whole-person discussion). \n\n \n16                                                                                                                                           \nApplicant and his spouse have frequent contact with their relatives in Iraq. \nFrequent contacts with family in foreign countries are a manifestation of one\u2019s care and \nconcern for relatives living in those foreign countries. Applicant retains property in Iraq \nand provides financial support to his mother. His and his spouse\u2019s relationships with \nresidents of Iraq raise important foreign influence security concerns. He left his work site \nwithout permission resulting in termination of his employment. \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude foreign influence and \npersonal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.i:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Edmunds, Esq. \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGARCIA, Candace Le\u2019i, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 17, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on November 2, 2017, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on May 10, 2018. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on May 24, \n2018, scheduling the hearing for June 14, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \n01/10/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nI appended to the record, as Hearing Exhibits (HE) I, II, and III, respectively, the \nGovernment\u2019s discovery letter and exhibit list, and Applicant\u2019s exhibit list. Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 3 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified, called one witness, and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through S, which \nwere admitted in evidence without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) \non June 25, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant denied both of the SOR allegations. She is 52 years old. She married \nin 1986, divorced in 2009, and remarried in 2015. She has two children, both of whom \nare adults.1 \n \n \nApplicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2012. She has worked for her current \nemployer, a defense contractor, since 2017. She previously worked for another defense \ncontractor from 2006 through 2017. She has held a security clearance since around \n2008.2  \n \n  \n \nThe SOR alleges two delinquent consumer accounts totaling $31,491 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a - 1.b). The allegations are established by an October 2016 credit report. SOR \u00b6 1.a \nis for a $14,510 charged-off credit card, and SOR \u00b6 1.b is for a $16,981 credit card in \ncollection. Applicant opened both credit cards between 2004 and 2006. She used them \nprimarily for her tuition expenses, as well as for household expenses and wedding \nexpenses for her daughter in 2008.3  \n \n \nApplicant attributed her delinquent debts to her 2008 separation and 2009 \ndivorce. The divorce decree held her responsible for five debts, two of which were the \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. She went from a two-income to a single-income \nhousehold, at a time when she earned approximately $40,000 annually. She received \nspousal support for only a few months after the divorce. She did not receive child \nsupport, as both of her children were adults, but she continued to support one child who \nlived with her after the divorce. She was in school part-time from 2006 through 2012, \nand though her then-employer provided tuition reimbursement, it was not at 100%.4  \n \n \nIn 2009, Applicant closed all five of her credit cards for which she was held \nresponsible, and she retained the services of a debt consolidation company to assist \nher with settling them, to include SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b, as she did not have the income \nto pay her outstanding debts in full. She chose to try to resolve her outstanding debts \nrather than join her ex-husband\u2019s bankruptcy that he filed in 2009. She testified that she \nworked with and made payments to the debt consolidation company for three years, \n                                                     \n1 Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR; Tr. at 16-17, 27-31, 38; GE 1; AE D, E. \n \n2 Tr. at 26-27, 39-41; GE 1; AE C, D, G. \n \n3 Tr. at 25-60. \n \n4 Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR; Tr. at 25-60; GE 1, 3; AE C, I, J.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \nfrom 2009 through 2012, in an effort to resolve her outstanding debts. She indicated \nthat the debt consolidation company successfully settled three of her credit cards, to \ninclude another credit card that she had with the same creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.b. The 2016 \ncredit report corroborates Applicant\u2019s claim that she resolved several other outstanding \ndebts.5 \n \n \nApplicant testified that the debt consolidation company was unable to settle SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b. She indicated that the creditor for SOR \u00b6 1.a was unwilling to work with \na third party to settle the debt, and the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b was charged off in 2010 \nbefore a settlement could be reached. She did not subsequently attempt to negotiate a \nsettlement directly with both creditors because when the debt consolidation company \n\u201ccalled me and told me . . . that they were not able to settle those, I thought we were \ndone. Since they were not able to, I didn\u2019t realize that I might be able to.\u201d She also \nindicated that at the time, her limited income prevented her from paying both debts in \nfull, as she did not receive a significant pay raise until after she earned her degree in \n2012.6 \n \n \nAfter she received the SOR in October 2017, Applicant testified that she \nimmediately contacted both of the creditors for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b, in an attempt to \nsettle both accounts. She indicated that she had multiple conversations with the creditor \nfor SOR \u00b61.a, and she requested documentation regarding her efforts to settle the debt \nto no avail. She also indicated that she was told by both creditors that both accounts \nwere archived and no longer in collection, and that she should reach out to the credit \nreporting agencies if she continued to have problems with her credit report.  Both debts \nare not reported on her recent credit reports from 2017 and 2018, and she has not had \nany such problems with her credit report. She could not recall if she ever received an \nIRS Form 1099-A for either debt. She acknowledged that neither creditor told her that \nthey would not accept payment towards her accounts, but stated that she and her \nhusband would have paid both debts if she were given information about where she \ncould send payment.7 \n \n \n As of the date of the hearing, Applicant and her husband earned a combined \nincome of $255,000 annually. Their assets, to include their home, total approximately \n$529,000. Applicant testified that she likely took a credit counseling course when she \nenrolled with the debt consolidation company, and she took another such course on the \ndate of the hearing. She indicated that she learned budgeting skills and she manages \nand pays her bills in a timely manner. Their budget reflects a substantial positive net \nremainder after their monthly expenses are paid. She does not have any other \ndelinquent debts.8 \n \n                                                     \n5 Tr. at 25-60; GE 3; AE H, R. \n \n6 Tr. at 25-60; AE H. \n \n7 Tr. at 25-60; GE 2; AE A, O. \n \n8 Tr. at 19, 22, 25-28, 32, 35-37; GE 1-3; AE A, B, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nAs of the date of the hearing, Applicant\u2019s husband worked as a program manager \nfor a defense contractor and held a security clearance since 1984. He met Applicant in \n2008. He testified that he was aware of both of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts and he also \nattributed them to her divorce. He testified that she told him that she previously \nattempted to resolve both debts through a debt consolidation company. He also testified \nthat she told him that when she recently contacted both creditors, she was told that the \naccounts were archived and the debts no longer existed. He consequently advised her \nto ask both creditors to provide documentation reflecting such, which she did to no avail. \nHe testified that they would have paid both debts if they were still outstanding. He \ntestified that she had taken a credit counseling course, and he described her approach \nto handling finances as frugal. He testified that they handle their finances jointly, they do \nnot have any delinquent debts, and they have timely filed their income tax returns. A \nnumber of character references described Applicant as a trustworthy, honest, and \nreliable individual.9 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \n                                                     \n9 Tr. at 15-25; AE D, F, Q, R. \n\n \n5 \n \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n  \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant was unable to pay her debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c) as disqualifying conditions. Applicant has had the ability since at least \n2012 to try to resolve the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b. She credibly testified that she \ndid not realize she could attempt to do so after the debt consolidation company was \nunsuccessful in their attempts at settling both accounts. She also credibly testified that \nshe was willing and attempted to do so when she contacted both creditors after she \nreceived the SOR, but was unable to since both creditors told her that the accounts \nwere archived and no longer outstanding. As such, I find that AG \u00b6 19(b) is not \nestablished. \n\n \n6 \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control, as previously discussed, contributed to \nher financial problems. Thus, the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full \napplication of AG \u00b6 20(b), she must provide evidence that she acted responsibly under \nhis circumstances. Applicant credibly testified that she tried to resolve both of the SOR \ndebts, as well as three other debts that were outstanding at the time, through the debt \nconsolidation company that she worked with for three years. When the company was \nunsuccessful in settling both accounts, she credibly testified that she did not realize she \ncould attempt to do so. She also credibly testified that she attempted to settle both \naccounts after she received the SOR, but was told by both creditors that the accounts \nwere archived and no longer outstanding. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(e) apply. \n \nA security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. See ISCR Case \nNo. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). The adjudicative guidelines do not require that \nan individual make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, pay the debts \nalleged in the SOR first, or establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or \nshe need only establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, \n2008). \n\n \n7 \n \n There is sufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant acted responsibly under \nher circumstances to address her delinquent debts. She obtained credit counseling \nthrough the debt consolidation company, and she took another such course on the date \nof the hearing. Both of the SOR debts are not reported on her recent credit reports from \n2017 and 2018, and she does not have any other delinquent debts. Her finances are \nunder control and there is sufficient evidence to conclude that her financial problems are \nunlikely to recur. Her debts do not cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(c), and 20(d) are established. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis.

Eligibility for security clearance access is \ngranted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 27, 2015, Applicant signed and certified an Electronic \nQuestionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) application for a security clearance. \nThe Department of Defense (DOD) could not make the preliminary affirmative findings \nrequired to grant a security clearance. DOD issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), dated October 2, 2017, detailing security concerns under the guideline for \nforeign influence (Guideline B). The action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), June 8, 2017.  \n \n\n  2 \n \nApplicant provided his notarized answer on November 13, 2017. The case was \nassigned to me on June 12, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on June 25, 2018, for a hearing on July 23, 2018. \nThe hearing was held as scheduled. The Government\u2019s one exhibit (GE) 11 and \nApplicant\u2019s nine exhibits (AE) A-I were entered into evidence without objection.2 One \nhearing exhibit (HE) 1 (administrative notice) was admitted in evidence. DOHA received \nthe transcript (Tr.), and the record closed on July 31, 2018. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nI have taken administrative notice of certain relevant facts related to Pakistan. \nThese facts come from source material published by the Department of State and \nDepartment of Justice. The facts are limited to matters of general knowledge and not \nsubject to reasonable dispute.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s mother, his brother, and three sisters are \ncitizens and residents of Pakistan. The last allegation is that he sends approximately \n$300 to $400 a month to his mother in Pakistan. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant \nadmitted the factual allegations.  \n \n \nApplicant, 41 years old, was born in Pakistan in 1977. He has been married since \nApril 2008, and has two children, an eight-year-old daughter and a five-year-old son. He \nhas owned his home since May 2011. He has been working as a cybersecurity \nspecialist since July 10, 2018. He had a similar position in his three previous jobs. In \n2013 and 2014, he was a network engineer. Between 2009 and 2012, he was primarily \nunemployed while attending school. From 2005 to January 2008, he was working \nremotely as a network administrator and a software engineer in a European country for \na software company headquartered in Pakistan. He earned educational credits from \nJanuary 2004 to May 2006, and June 2006 to February 2008, while working in Europe. \nFrom 2013 to the present, he continued earning educational credits, but has not \nreceived a degree. He has held a security clearance since May 2013. (GE 1 at 9, 14-20, \n50; Tr. 51-57) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife, born in Pakistan, is 40 years old and an internist at a local \nhospital. She returned to Pakistan for four years of medical school which she completed \nin 2001. In 2007, she completed her internship and residency in the United States. Her \nentire family, including five sisters and her parents, also born in Pakistan, immigrated to \nthe United States in 1996. All members of her immediate family are U.S. citizens, \nexcept for Applicant\u2019s father\u2019s three sisters who immigrated to America two years ago \nand are permanent residents. Her father (Applicant\u2019s father-in-law) worked for a fertilizer \ncompany in Pakistan; in the United States, he began working as a taxi driver, but is now \n                                            \n1 The Government\u2019s discovery letter dated December 18, 2017, was marked as GE 8. \n2 Applicant\u2019s exhibits, AE A through AE C, were separated into individual exhibits remarked as \nAE A through AE I. \n\n  3 \n \na real estate broker and owns a driver-license school. Her mother was employed as a \nteacher in Pakistan, but is a homemaker in the United States. Five of the sisters are \nmarried and live in the metropolitan area within a few miles of Applicant\u2019s family. His \nwife\u2019s niece (her oldest sister\u2019s daughter and a U.S. citizen) and her cousin, a \npermanent resident who immigrated to the United States in 2017, along with several of \nthe other in-laws, watch Applicant\u2019s two children during the day while Applicant and his \nwife are at work. Applicant is extensively involved in his children\u2019s extracurricular \nactivities like swimming and martial arts. (GE 1 at 1-9, 13; Tr. 12-25, 86-87) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s parents introduced her to Applicant in late 2007, when she was \ncompleting her medical residency and about to start practicing medicine. They talked on \nthe phone and realized they were compatible. He immigrated to the United States in \nFebruary 2008, and they married in April 2008.3 Approximately a year later, they spent \nthree weeks on a return trip to Pakistan to meet Applicant\u2019s parents. (GE 1 at 1-9, 13; \nTr. 12-22, 86-87) \n \n \nSOR 1.a \u2013 Applicant\u2019s mother, 71 years old, is a citizen of Pakistan. In February \n2018, she immigrated to the United States to live with Applicant. When she was living in \nPakistan, she was a teacher at a community school supported by the Pakistani \ngovernment, her only affiliation with the Pakistani government. She intends to become a \nU.S. citizen and live here permanently as traveling back to Pakistan with her illnesses \nmay be unwise and unhealthy. After his father died in 2015, Applicant began sending \nhis mother $300 to $400 a month to help pay for treatment of her illnesses. (SOR 1.d) \nBefore she immigrated to the United States in February 2018, Applicant contacted her \nabout once a week. (GE 1 at 26; Tr. 28-31, 60-62) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother lived at his father\u2019s Pakistani house before her move to the \nUnited States in February 2018. After his father died in 2015, she was the only person \nin the house. Applicant\u2019s brother (SOR 1.d) now owns the house and is responsible for \nthe upkeep. Applicant\u2019s parents have no other property in Pakistan, and her tenuous \nconnection to the Pakistani government has terminated with her retirement from the \nPakistani school system. (Tr. 63-64) \n \n \nSOR 1.b \u2013 Applicant\u2019s brother, 50 years old, is a citizen and resident of Pakistan, \nand teacher at an elementary school along with his wife. His brother has three children. \nHe speaks to him through the social media on his birthday. Applicant\u2019s e-QIP reflects \nthat he contacts his brother weekly by phone. As with Applicant\u2019s mother, the brother \nand his wife have a tenuous affiliation with the Pakistani government based on their \nteaching positions. They have no connection to the Pakistani military. (GE 1 at 30-31; \nTr. 30-31, 65-67)  \n \n \nSOR 1.c \u2013 Applicant has three sisters who are citizens and residents of Pakistan. \nTheir ages are 50, 40, and 44. The 50-year-old is a school teacher. Her husband works \nin the billing department of a community power company. The sister has children, but \n                                            \n3 His wife indicated that he was completing his master\u2019s degree, but his e-QIP indicates that he \nnever received a degree in 2006 or 2008, and has no degree in information technology \n\n  4 \n \nApplicant does not know the number or their ages. Though he testified he only contacts \nher about once a year, he hears about all his sisters through his 47-year-old sister who \nis a U.S. citizen. In his e-QIP, he indicated that he contacted her weekly. As with \nApplicant\u2019s mother, the 50-year-old sister has a vague link to the Pakistani government, \nbut no connection to the military. (GE 1 at 31-36; Tr. 68-69) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s 50-year-old sister, a resident citizen of Pakistan, was a school \nteacher and is now a housewife. Her husband operates a hardware business. They \nhave children under 18 years old. According to Applicant\u2019s e-QIP, his contact with her \nwas weekly by phone. They have no connection to the Pakistani government or military. \n(GE 1 at 31-36; Tr. 74-76) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s 44-year-old sister, a resident citizen of Pakistan, is married to a \nPakistani who is a former U.S. military veteran. Her husband became disabled while on \nduty and returned to Pakistan in 2001. This sister has children over the age of 18. \nApplicant initially testified that he has no contact with this sister, then he stated that he \ncontacts her through a social media application. (GE 1 at 31-36; Tr. 76-82)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s 40-year-old sister, a citizen and resident of Pakistan, was a school \nteacher, but is now a housewife. Her husband operates a hardware business. They \nhave no affiliation with the Pakistani government or military. (GE 1 at 31-36; Tr. 74-76) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s 47-year-old sister (not alleged in the SOR) was born in Pakistan. She \nimmigrated to the United States in 2012 and was naturalized an American citizen in \n2017. She works as a medical assistant in a hospital. She is married to a U.S citizen \nwho is a taxi driver. They have no children. Applicant testified that he contacts her \nweekly, but his e-QIP indicates he was contacting her daily. Applicant has not provided \nany financial support to any of his siblings. (AE C; Tr. 67, 70-75)  \n \n \nSince immigrating to the United States and marrying in 2008, Applicant has taken \nsix trips to Pakistan. The year after he and his wife were married, they traveled to the \ncountry. In 2011, Applicant and his wife made the trip so their parents could see their \nfirst child who had been born in 2010. In 2013, they went to Pakistan to introduce their \nsecond child to his grandparents. In 2014, Applicant\u2019s parents came to the United \nStates. Applicant went to Pakistan twice in 2015: once to see his sick father; and then to \nattend his father\u2019s funeral. Applicant returned to the country for his father\u2019s death \nanniversary in 2016, a cultural practice to observe his passing. (GE 1 at 40-50; Tr. 36-\n38, 83) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s family members in Pakistan do not know what he does for a living. He \nhas received training on how to safeguard classified information. He has also received \ntraining to report any efforts to exert pressure on him through his foreign family \nmembers who are citizens and residents in Pakistan.  \n \n \nApplicant and his wife\u2019s U.S. assets total approximately $349,000. The checking \nand savings accounts are $54,000. Their home is valued at $188,000. Their retirement \n\n  5 \n \naccounts total $63,000. Their automobiles are worth $44,000. Neither Applicant nor his \nwife have any financial interests in Pakistan. (Tr. 44; AE A) \n \nCharacter Evidence  \n \n \nApplicant submitted character references from his family members, two \nneighbors, a former supervisor, and a former coworker. His 47-year-old sister, a U.S \ncitizen, believes Applicant appreciates the freedoms, i.e., the right to vote, afforded him \nin the United States. He demonstrated good judgment in paying for his mother\u2019s health \ncare and efficiently managing her immigration to the United States. Applicant is a good \nfamily man. (AE C)  \n \n \nThe sister of Applicant\u2019s wife met him in 2008 and considers him to be \ntrustworthy and ethical. He has shown that he is a responsible husband and father. (AE \nD) A neighbor of two years knows that Applicant is thankful for the benefits of being an \nAmerican citizen. (AE E) Applicant\u2019 coworker since September 2016, commended \nApplicant\u2019s customer service qualities, his information technology expertise, and his \nteam player and leadership characteristics. (AE F) A network engineer indicated that he \nworked with Applicant at a military installation and found him to be dependable and \nfocused on the mission. Applicant expected to be buried in the metropolitan area of his \ncurrent residence. (AE G) A former supervisor who worked with Applicant for 18 months \nin 2016 to June 2018, indicated that Applicant exemplified a dependable performance \nand was always concerned about improving the security of the computer networks. (AE \nH)  \n \nAdministrative Notice \u2013 Pakistan \n \nPakistan is a parliamentary Islamic republic with significant internal problems \ncaused by terrorist organizations concentrated in several locations within the country. \nAs of 2014, parts of Pakistan\u2019s Federally Administered Tribal Areas, Khyber \nPakhtunkhwa province, and Balochistan province were regarded as a safe haven for \nterrorist groups, including al-Qaeda, the Haqqani Network, Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan, \nLasahkar I Jhangvi, and the Afghan Taliban. These groups create ongoing security \nproblems by targeting western interests, U.S. citizens, senior Pakistani officials, minority \npolitical groups, and religious entities. In September 2012, the United States officially \ndeclared the Haqqani Network a foreign terrorist organization. Operations in 2014 by \nthe Pakistani military against some of the terror groups had with only marginal success.  \n \nThe human rights record of Pakistan is not good. Extrajudicial killings, torture, \nand disappearances have been reported, along with intrusive government surveillance \nof politicians, political activists, and the media. Government and police corruption, \nsexual harassment, and gender discrimination are persistent problems.  \n \n \n \n \n\n  6 \n \nPolices \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare flexible rules of law, apply together with common sense and the general factors of \nthe whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \n \nAnalysis \n \nForeign Influence \n \nAG \u00b6 6 sets forth the security under Guideline B: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \nThe nature of a country\u2019s government, its relationship to the United States, and \nits human rights record, are relevant in evaluating the chances that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government pressure or influence. As the guideline \nindicates, the country in question must be considered. Terrorist organizations, including \nthe Taliban and al-Qaeda, continue to operate against the United States and Pakistani \ninterests within Pakistan. The country has a poor human rights record that is aggravated \nexacerbated by the country\u2019s terrorism and violence. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s ties to foreign family members, the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s foreign family ties as well as each individual family tie must be considered. \n\n  7 \n \nConditions under AG \u00b6 7 that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \ninclude: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and  \n \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nContacts and ties to family members who are citizens of a foreign country do not \nautomatically disqualify an applicant from security clearance access. As set forth under \nAG \u00b6 7(a), the contacts are only disqualifying if they create a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation. The presence of terrorist and insurgent organizations, and the unstable \nsecurity situation within Pakistan intensify the heightened risk of foreign manipulation \nand exploitation. Applicant\u2019s brother and three sisters are citizens and residents of \nPakistan. He contacts them at various times during the year even though the contacts \nare minimal. He has traveled to Pakistan five times between 2009 and 2016. Overall, \nthe level of contacts that Applicant has with his brother and three Pakistani sisters, \ncreates a heightened risk of foreign influence under AG \u00b6 7(a). AG \u00b6 7(b) is applicable \nbecause Applicant\u2019s connections to his brother and three sisters create a potential \nconflict of interest between his obligation to protect classified or sensitive information or \ntechnology and his desire to help his sisters by providing that information. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) \nand 7(b) is given much less consideration to Applicant\u2019s mother since she is no longer a \nresident of Pakistan. In February 2018, she became a permanent U.S. resident living \nwith Applicant\u2019s family in the United States.  \n \n The application of AG \u00b6 7(e) is based on Applicant\u2019s shared living quarters with \nhis spouse (a naturalized U.S. citizen), potentially creating indirect manipulation of \nApplicant through his wife\u2019s in-laws. AG \u00b6 7(e) has little or no relevance to Applicant\u2019s \nspouse because her entire immediate family of five sisters and parents are U.S. citizens \nand live within a few miles of Applicant\u2019s family in the United States. In addition, the \nrecord does not address his wife\u2019s contact with Applicant\u2019s siblings who are citizens and \nresidents of Pakistan. \n \n \n \n \n\n  8 \n \n \nConditions under AG \u00b6 8 that could mitigate security concerns include: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \n \nApplicant has ties and regular contacts with his brother and three sisters in \nPakistan. In view of these contacts, and the terrorist elements that target Pakistani \ncivilians and U.S. interests in the country, Applicant could be placed in a position of \nhaving to choose between the family interests and the interests of the United States. AG \n\u00b6 8(a) does not apply.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) applies. Applicant has developed longstanding bonds to the United \nStates. He has lived here since February 2008. He married his wife (a naturalized U.S \ncitizen) in April 2008. Applicant became a U.S. citizen in September 2012. His two \nchildren were born in the United States and he is thoroughly involved in their after-\nschool activities as well as their long-term success down life\u2019s highway. His closest ties \nin the United States are his wife, his children, and his wife\u2019s entire family, who are all \nU.S. citizens. In February 2018, his mother became a permanent resident and began \nliving with Applicant. She intends to acquire her U.S. citizenship when eligible and live in \nthis country throughout her senior years. In sum, Applicant can be expected to resolve \nany conflict in favor of U.S. interests.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c) is inapplicable since Applicant did not rebut the presumption that his \nrelationships with his brother and three sisters are neither casual nor infrequent. Though \nApplicant\u2019s five trips to Pakistan reinforce the notion that his relationships with foreign \nfamily members were not casual and infrequent, the trips do not raise security concerns. \nTwo of the trips were to introduce Applicant, his wife, and their children to foreign family \nmembers. Three of the trips were related to Applicant\u2019s father illness, his death, and a \nfinal trip to commemorate the father\u2019s death.   \n \n \n\n  9 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nI have examined the evidence under the foreign influence guideline in the context \nof the nine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \nI considered the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the context of \nthe general factors of the whole person concept. I considered that Applicant moved to \nthe United States in 2008. I considered Applicant\u2019s marriage to a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen in April 2008, and that his two children were born in the United States. Applicant \nbecame a U.S. citizen in 2012. His mother lives with Applicant\u2019s family and has been a \npermanent resident since February 2018. She intends to become a U.S. citizen when \neligible.   \n \nI considered the compliments that Applicant received from his former coworkers, \nhis sister and his in-laws. I considered that Applicant appreciates the freedoms he has \nin the United States, and his respect for the right to vote. All of Applicant\u2019s financial \ninterests are located in America. Considering the evidence from an overall \ncommonsense point of view, Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from \nforeign influence.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline B):  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  10 \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted.  \n \n \n_________________ \nPaul J. Mason \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 9, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations, and Guideline E, personal conduct. The DOD acted under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 12, 2017, and he requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was originally assigned to another administrative \njudge in November 2018. It was reassigned to me on February 27, 2019. The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on March 25, 2019, \nand the hearing was convened as scheduled on April 8, 2019. The Government offered \n\n \n2 \n \nexhibits (GE) 1-8, which were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified, \ncalled one witness, and offered one exhibit (AE A) that was admitted. The record remained \nopen until May 17, 2019 (extended to June 14, 2019), to allow Applicant to submit \ndocumentary evidence. He offered AE B-E, which were admitted without objection. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 30, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted some of the financial allegations and denied others. He denied \nthe personal conduct allegations. His admissions are incorporated into these findings of \nfact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings \nof fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began working at \nhis present job in 2018. He worked for other government contractors before attaining his \ncurrent position. He experienced periods of unemployment to include: December 2011 to \nApril 2012; July 2012 to March 2013; and June 2013 to February 2014. He has been \nemployed full-time since February of 2014. He works in the information technology (IT) \nfield. He served in the Air Force from 1998 to 2008, when he was honorably discharged as \na staff sergeant (paygrade E-5) for medical reasons. He deployed three times during his \nservice. He has not completed his application for veterans\u2019 benefits from the VA. He is a \nhigh school graduate and has taken numerous college courses, but has not obtained a \ndegree. He is married for a second time and has two stepchildren from this marriage. He \nsupports an 11-year-old daughter from his first marriage. (Tr. 6, 20-23; GE1) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged 32 delinquent debts totaling approximately $74,214. Of that total, \nover $50,000 of the debt is for delinquent student loans. The debts were listed in credit \nreports from September 2016, August 2017, and April 2019. The SOR also alleged \nApplicant failed to list two liens, a judgment and multiple collection debts on his security \nclearance application (SCA) executed August 7, 2016, as he was required to do. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a \u2013 1.ff, 2.a-2.b; GE 1, 3-4, 8)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife handles the family\u2019s finances. She does not work outside the home. \nApplicant provided documentation showing that the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, 1.p, 1.r, 1.t, \n1.z, 1.aa, 1.cc, and 1.ff were paid. Those debts are resolved. He also provided proof that \nthe debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.b was resolved when the creditor cancelled the debt. He \ndocumented making payments to the IRS on the cancelled debt. The debts listed in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.l, 1.w, 1.bb, 1.dd, and 1.ee do not appear on Applicant\u2019s latest credit report and are \nresolved for him. (Tr. 38, 41-43, 45-47; 49-50, 53, 55-60; GE 4, 8; AE B-C, E) \n \n \nThe remaining non-student-loan debt includes two telecommunications collection \naccounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n-1.o), which Applicant disputed, but provided no documentation \nsupporting those disputes. Applicant admitted the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.s. 1.u, 1.v and \n1.x-1.y are still owed. He did not present proof of payment or payment plans. These debts \nare unresolved. (Tr. 43-45, 48-53) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant incurred over $50,000 of student loans after using all of his GI Bill \neducational benefits (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c-.1.i, 1.k, 1.m, 1.q). These loans have been \ndelinquent since April 2017. He claims to have spoken with the loan servicing agent, but \nhe has no plan to repay the student loans except to seek what his wife described as \nadditional deferments or a \u201czero dollar payment plan,\u201d which apparently is a payment plan \nbased upon the debtor\u2019s income. These debts are unresolved. (36-37, 87-89; AE E) \n \n \nApplicant is apparently using a budget, though none was produced, and he and his \nwife have enrolled in a financial management class offered by a well-known national \nfinancial expert. Applicant\u2019s wife testified that at the end of the month, after all bills and \nexpenses are paid, they typically have a residual of between $50-$100. (Tr. 61-62, 79; AE \nD) \n \n \nApplicant presented six reference letters from current and former coworkers. All \ndescribe him as a trusted and competent professional who should retain his security \nclearance. (AE A) \n \n \nApplicant failed to list his liens, a judgment, and other delinquent debts on his SCA, \nother than his child support obligations. His student loans were not yet delinquent when he \ncompleted his SCA. He claimed that he wanted to be able to explain his answers when \ncompleting his SCA, but was not allowed to do so by his company. His wife\u2019s testimony \nsupported that assertion. When Applicant was interviewed by a defense investigator, after \ncompleting his SCA, he was asked about whether he had any financial issues. Besides \nexplaining his child support arrearage, he stated he was unaware of any other debt. He \nwas then confronted with other debt listed in his September 2016 credit report. In his SOR \nanswer, Applicant also claimed his memory is affected by brain injury he suffered while in \nthe Air Force. He did not provide supporting documentation for this assertion. I did not find \nApplicant credible. (Tr. 66-67, 90-91; Answer; GE 1-2) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to \nclassified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel \nsecurity concern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, \nsubstance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. Affluence that cannot be \nexplained by known sources of income is also a security concern insofar as it \nmay result from criminal activity, including espionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n\n \n5 \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.   \n \nApplicant has delinquent debts that remain unpaid or unresolved. I find both the \nabove disqualifying conditions are raised.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nAlthough Applicant has resolved many of his debts, he still has not made \narrangements to pay his delinquent student loans, which comprise over $50,000 worth of \nhis total debt. These debts are ongoing and cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s unemployment before 2014 can be considered a circumstance beyond \nhis control. However, he failed to act responsibly in dealing with his student loans by \nestablishing payment plans. Overall, the record evidence does not support that Applicant \nacted responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) is only partially applicable.  \n \n \n \nApplicant presented some evidence that he intends to get financial counseling. \nGiven the unpaid status of his student loans, Applicant\u2019s financial problems are not under \ncontrol and good-faith efforts to pay or resolve the remaining debts are lacking. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n\n \n6 \n \n20(c) and 20(d) only partially apply. Applicant failed to document his asserted disputes of \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n-1.o.  AG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or \nprovide truthful and candid answers during national security investigative or \nadjudicative processes. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nApplicant failed to list tax liens, a judgment, and multiple collection accounts on his \nSCA in August 2016. I did not find the reasons why he omitted this information credible. \nHe had a chance to come forward with this information during his background interview \nwith a defense investigator, but he failed to do so. Once confronted with the specific debts \nhe admitted them. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 \nand found the following relevant:   \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; and \n \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.   \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant failed to make a prompt good-faith disclosure during his background \ninvestigation. He claimed his company put pressure on him not to explain his answers \nwhen he completed his SCA. His actions did not constitute minor offenses and create \ndoubt about his overall trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment, and ultimately on \nhis worthiness to hold a security clearance. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) and 17(c) do not apply. Some \nevidence supports AG \u00b6 17(b), however, Applicant did not fully cooperate until confronted \nduring his background investigation. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity \nat the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe guideline and the whole-person concept.       \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s federal contractor service, his military service including his \ndeployments, and his periods of unemployment. However, I also considered that he has \nmade insufficient efforts to resolve his student loans. He has not established a meaningful \ntrack record of debt management, which causes me to question his ability to resolve his \ndebts. The evidence supports that he deliberately falsified his SCA. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the financial considerations or the personal conduct security \nconcerns. I considered the exceptions under Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, \nAppendix C, dated June 8, 2017, and determined they are not applicable in this case. \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs: 1.a, 1.c - 1.i \n \n \n \n \n \n     1.k, 1.m \u2013 1.o, \n \n \n \n \n     1.q, 1.s, 1.u \u2013 \n \n \n \n \n     1.v, 1.x \u2013 1.y:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs: 1.b, 1.j, 1.l, 1.p,   \n \n \n \n \n     1.r, 1.t, 1.w, 1.z,  \n \n \n \n \n     1.aa \u2013 1.ff: \n For Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs:  2.a \u2013 2.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 33 years old and employed by a defense contractor. He is single, with one child. Applicant is seeking to retain a security clearance in connection with his employment. Applicant is a disabled, retired Soldier. He was severely injured on active duty in a combat zone. He suffered a traumatic brain injury (TBI), as well as other physical injuries. He also has been diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). He was medically retired in 2010 with the rank of Specialist (E-4). He continues to have physical and psychological issues connected to his military service. These issues include organizational skills, ability to prioritize, and memory lapses. This situation had an impact on his ability to organize his finances and pay his debts for several years.

(Government Exhibit 1.) On October 16, 2017, \nthe Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline F \n(Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National \nSecurity Adjudication Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \n \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, effective within the Department of \nDefense after June 8, 2017. \n  \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on December 13, 2017, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared \nto proceed on February 12, 2018. The case was assigned to me on February 26, 2018. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on \nMarch 6, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 4, 2018. The Government \noffered Government Exhibits 1 through 4, which were admitted without objection. \nApplicant offered Applicant Exhibits A through N, which were admitted without objection, \nand testified on his own behalf. He called one additional witness. I granted Applicant\u2019s \nrequest to leave the record open to permit him to submit additional evidence. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing on April 12, 2018. Applicant submitted Applicant \nExhibits O, P, and Q in a timely manner. Department Counsel had no objection and the \nexhibits were admitted into evidence. The record then closed.  \n  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 33 years old and employed by a defense contractor. He is single, with \none child. Applicant is seeking to retain a security clearance in connection with his \nemployment.  \n \nApplicant is a disabled, retired Soldier. He was severely injured on active duty in a \ncombat zone. He suffered a traumatic brain injury (TBI), as well as other physical injuries. \nHe also has been diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). He was \nmedically retired in 2010 with the rank of Specialist (E-4). He continues to have physical \nand psychological issues connected to his military service. These issues include \norganizational skills, ability to prioritize, and memory lapses. This situation had an impact \non his ability to organize his finances and pay his debts for several years. (Applicant \nExhibits N, Q at 47-61; Tr. 41-49, 54, 153.) \n \nApplicant was medically retired in February 2010. He was unemployed or \nunderemployed until November 2011, when he was hired by the predecessor of his \ncurrent employer. This also had an impact on his ability to pay his debts. (Government \nExhibit 1 at Section 13A.) \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \n \n \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, \nuntrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Applicant \nadmitted SOR allegations 1.c through 1.yy, 1.aaa through 1.ccc, 1.eee, 1.fff, and 1.iii \nthrough 1.kkk. He denied allegations 1.a, 1.b, 1.zz, 1.ddd, 1.ggg, and 1.hhh.   \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant owed approximately $17,362 in past-due \nindebtedness to various creditors. Support for the existence and amount of the debts is \nsupported by admissions of the Applicant, and credit reports submitted by the \nGovernment dated May 10, 2016; and September 8, 2017. (Government Exhibits 2 and \n3.) Applicant submitted an annotated version of Government Exhibit 2. (Applicant Exhibit \nC.) He also submitted additional credit reports dated November 4, 2017; March 22, 2018; \nand March 26, 2018. (Applicant Exhibits D, E, and F.) \n \n \nThe current status of the debts is as follows:  \n \n \n1.a. Applicant denied that he owed a bank $4,432 for an automobile that was \nrepossessed from Applicant in 2011. He was unable to pay this debt because he was \nunderemployed at the time. Applicant had never been contacted by this creditor and had \nno further information about the status of this debt. It is unresolved. (Government Exhibits \n2 and 3; Applicant Exhibit D; Tr. 91-92.)      \n \n \n1.b. Applicant denied owing $2,971 to a creditor for a collection account, stating in \nhis Answer that there was no record supporting him owing that amount of money. \nApplicant testified that he spoke to this creditor and they had stopped all collection \nproceedings concerning Applicant. The creditor said that they had closed the files on this \ndebt, and others further described below that Applicant admitted in his Answer. (Applicant \nExhibits C and M; Tr. 70-72, 132-133.) \n \n \n \n1.c. Applicant admitted that he owed $2,383 for a past-due student loan debt. \nApplicant has a payment arrangement concerning this debt, and is in compliance with \nthat arrangement. This debt is being resolved. (Applicant Exhibits E at 39, K at 11, and L; \nTr. 76-79, 151-152.) \n \n \n1.d. Applicant admitted that he owed $1,229 for a second past-due student loan \ndebt. Applicant has a payment arrangement concerning this debt, and is in compliance \nwith that arrangement. This debt is being resolved. (Applicant Exhibits E at 39, K at 11, \nand L; Tr. 76-79, 151-152.) \n \n \n1.e. Applicant admitted that he owed $599 to a creditor for a charged-off debt. He \nestablished a payment arrangement with this creditor, and provided supporting \ndocumentation showing this debt was paid. It is resolved.  (Applicant Exhibits E at 22, K \nat 9-10; Tr. 79-81, 116, 135.) \n \n \n1.f. Applicant admitted that he owed $477 to a creditor for a charged-off debt. He \nestablished a payment arrangement with this creditor, and provided supporting \ndocumentation showing this debt was paid. It is resolved.  (Applicant Exhibits E at 22, K \nat 9-10; Tr. 79-81, 116, 135.) \n \n \n1.g, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, 1.m, 1.o, 1.r, 1.u, 1.w, 1.x, 1.y, 1.z, 1.ee, and 1.oo. Applicant \nadmitted owing these debts to the same creditor, a collection agency. They are medical \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nco-pays and total $1,391. Applicant contacted this creditor and was informed that \ncollection attempts had been stopped, and the files had been purged. Applicant was also \ninformed that he owed nothing further to this creditor. He indicated that he was willing and \nable to pay these debts if possible. These debts are not resolved. (Applicant Exhibit M; \nTr. 70-72, 103-105.) \n \n \n1.h, 1.l, 1.p, 1.s, 1.aa, 1.bb, 1.dd, 1.ff, 1.gg, 1.hh, 1.ii, 1.jj, 1.tt, 1.vv, 1.ww, 1.xx, \n1.yy, and 1.aaa. Applicant admitted owing these past-due debts to a different debt-\ncollecting creditor. They are primarily medical co-pays and total $1,069. Applicant has \npaid all these debts in full, as shown by documentation from the creditor. In addition, he \npaid $74 for other debts that were not alleged in the SOR. All these debts are resolved. \n(Applicant Exhibit Q at 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 26, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, \n35, and 36; Tr. 59-64, 100-101.) \n \n \n1.n. Applicant admitted owing this debt for a collection account for a telephone bill \nin the amount of $128. Applicant attempted to contact the collection agent for this debt, \nbut was unsuccessful. This debt is not resolved. (Applicant Exhibit J.) \n \n \n1.q. Applicant admitted owing a creditor $79 for a medical collection account. \nApplicant testified that he had paid this debt in full, once he found out who the current \ncreditor was. This debt is resolved. (Applicant Exhibit M; Tr. 64-66.) \n \n \n1.t. Applicant admitted owing a creditor $76 for a past-due debt to a named \ncompany. A debt to this company was paid in full as described under SOR allegation \n1.aaa, set forth above. Comparing entries in the Government credit report (Government \nExhibit 2 at 3) with the payment document for allegation 1.aaa (Applicant Exhibit 2 at 32) \nI find this is the same debt and it has been resolved. \n \n \n1.v, 1.cc, 1.kk, 1.ll, 1.mm, 1.nn, 1.pp, 1.qq, 1.rr, 1.ss, 1.uu, and 1.fff. Applicant \nadmitted owing these past-due medical debts. The debts total $446. Through research, \nApplicant was able to determine that the named creditor named in allegation 1.cc was \nactually collecting for all these debts. Applicant has paid these debts in full, as shown by \ndocumentation from the creditor. These debts are resolved. (Applicant Exhibit Q at 9, 12, \n18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, and 28; Tr. 87-90.) \n \n \n1.zz. Applicant denied owing a delinquent debt to a bank stating he had paid it. \nThe SOR does not state a dollar amount as to this alleged past-due debt. Government \nExhibit 2 does not state a past-due amount concerning this debt, noting, \u201cPurchased by \nanother lender.\u201d Applicant stated that he paid this debt in full years before the SOR was \nissued. Government has failed to show that Applicant owes any current debt to this \ncreditor. (Government Exhibit2; Tr. 135-138.) \n \n \n1.bbb. Applicant admitted owing $119 for a past-due medical debt. During his \ntestimony Applicant stated that he had no further information about this debt, and had not \npaid it. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 72-73.) \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \n   \n1.ccc. Applicant admitted owing $118 for a past-due medical debt. During his \ntestimony Applicant stated that he had no further information about this debt, and had not \npaid it. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 72-73.)   \n \n \n1.ddd. Applicant denied that he owed a creditor $629 for a past-due debt for \ntelevision services. He stated that he had resolved all of his debts for services such as \nthis when he left a residence several years before the hearing. No other information was \navailable. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. 83-84, 115.) \n \n \n1.eee. Applicant admitted that he owed a bank $610 for a debt. Applicant testified \nthat the only account he had with this bank was for the automobile that was repossessed \nand discussed under allegation 1.a, above. No other information was available. This debt \nis not resolved. (Tr. 81-82.) \n \n \n1.ggg. Applicant denied owing a past-due debt to a utility company in the amount \nof $225. He stated that he had resolved all of his debts for services such as this when he \nleft a residence several years before the hearing. No other information was available. This \ndebt is not resolved. (Tr. 83-84, 115-116.) \n \n \n1.hhh. Applicant denied owing a delinquent debt to a bank, stating in his Answer, \n\u201cI don\u2019t recognize this at all.\u201d The SOR does not state a dollar amount as to any alleged \npast-due debt. Government Exhibit 2 does not state a past-due amount concerning this \ndebt, noting, \u201cPurchased by another lender.\u201d Government has failed to show that \nApplicant owes any current debt to this creditor. (Government Exhibit 2; Tr. 135-138.) \n \n \n1.iii. Applicant admitted owing $56 for a past-due insurance bill. Applicant \ncontacted this insurance company and paid the debt in full. This debt has been resolved. \n(Applicant Exhibit M; Tr. 93.) \n \n \n1.jjj. Applicant admitted owing $106 to a city for a collection account. He submitted \ndocumentation that showed this debt had been paid in full. This debt is resolved. \n(Applicant Exhibit O; Tr. 93-94.) \n \n \n1.kkk. Applicant admitted owing $187 to a city for a collection account. He \nsubmitted documentation that showed this debt had been paid in full. This debt is \nresolved. (Applicant Exhibit O; Tr. 93-94.) \n \n \nThe business manager of Applicant\u2019s union has helped Applicant organize his \nfinances. This includes determining the full extent of his debt load and a plan moving \nforward to resolve it. (Applicant Exhibits I and J; Tr. 105-109.) \n \n \nApplicant has had some family issues that have impinged on his finances, \nincluding his grandmother\u2019s recent death and the hospitalization of his mother. Applicant \nrealized that he must take care of his own indebtedness first, in order to help his family \ninto the future. (Applicant Exhibits H, Q at 44-46; Tr. 109-114, 141-143.) \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current financial situation is stable. He lives very frugally, renting a \nroom in a house. Applicant continuously monitors his credit and pays off his older debts \nas his income allows. He is current on child support payments of $900 a month for his \ndaughter who lives in a different city. He has worked hard over the last several years to \nget his financial house in order, and has a plan to pay the rest of his debts in the near \nfuture. Applicant successfully paid off an automobile in 2016. He also paid off three \npersonal loans totaling approximately $20,000 including interest between 2014 and 2016. \nApplicant understands the importance of resolving his past-due debts and remaining \nfiscally secure into the future. (Applicant Exhibits C at 7, F at 10, I, J, K at 8, P at 5-8, Q \nat 37-43; Tr. 52-53, 64, 95, 101-103, 129-130, 144-147, 156-157.)  \n \nMitigation \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor testified on his behalf. He has known Applicant \nabout four years. He testified that Applicant is trustworthy and capable, and \nrecommended him for a position of trust. (Tr. 29-39.) \n \n \nApplicant provided two letters of recommendation from people who know him in \nthe defense industry. Applicant\u2019s program manager stated, \u201cI trust [Applicant] to continue \nworking in classified spaces and I have never found a reason to doubt or question him.\u201d \nA coworker stated, \u201cI have always trusted [Applicant] with information and I have never \nfound a reason to doubt or question him. I can confidently attest that he will not let you \ndown.\u201d (Applicant Exhibits B and C.)  \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \n \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant had approximately $17,000 in past-due debts that he had not paid or \nresolved as of the time the SOR was issued. These facts establish prima facie support \nfor the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate \nthose concerns. \n \n \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant had a difficult time transitioning from the military to civilian life. His \ninjuries, particularly a TBI and PTSD, made it difficult for him to focus and pay his bills. \nBefore 2014 there were issues with a repossessed automobile, and other past-due \nindebtedness. Since that time, he showed through documentation, that his financial \nsituation had improved. He was able to buy a car, and pay off three personal loans. He is \nable to pay his current debts, including child support for his daughter, and has a plan for \npaying off the remainder of his debt. AG \u00b6 20(b) applies because much of the debt, and \nApplicant\u2019s inability to pay it, was related to the injuries he suffered in the service. \n \nDespite continued medical issues, Applicant has taken control of his financial \nsituation. That is obvious once his entire financial history is examined. Certainly, he was \ndeficient in paying his TRICARE copays, which constitutes a lot of his debt. He has paid \n\n \n \n9 \n \n \nor resolved almost $7,000 of the debt set forth in the SOR. This includes making payment \narrangements for his student loans. He also paid off several of his medical creditors. He \nhas shown a good-faith effort to resolve his financial situation. As the DOHA Appeal Board \nhas said, \u201cAn applicant is not required to show that [he] has completely paid off [his] \nindebtedness, only that [he] has established a reasonable plan to resolve [his] debts and \nhas taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d1 AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(d) apply. \n   \nSince much of the remaining debt alleged in the SOR is old, Applicant has had a \nhard time finding the current creditors. Even when he had found such an entity, some \nhave told Applicant that collection efforts are no longer being made, and that they will not \ntake his money. Under the particular circumstances of this case, I find that AG \u00b6 20(e) \napplies to some extent. \n \nThe Appeal Board has stated: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrates that he has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and \nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the \nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u2018Available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.\u2019) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments \non all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and \nconcomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a \ntime. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in \nfurtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.2  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current financial status is stable, and he evinces a credible intent and \nability to maintain that stability into the future. Applicant has made substantial lifestyle \nchanges that will assist him in staying on a proper financial footing. He has fully mitigated \nall the allegations in the SOR. Paragraph 1 is found for Applicant. \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1ISCR Case No. 06-12930 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 17, 2008) (quoting ISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2-3 (App. \nBd. Jul. 6, 2006)). \n2 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). \n\n \n \n10 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for a national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant=s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.    \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has mitigated the \nconcerns regarding his financial situation. His actions have minimized the potential for \ncoercion or duress, and make recurrence of financial issues unlikely. Overall, the record \nevidence does not create substantial doubt as to Applicant=s present eligibility and \nsuitability for national security eligibility, and a security clearance. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by & E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.kkk: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n11 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant=s national security \neligibility for a security clearance.

Smith, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on March 2, 2015. On \nFebruary 8, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nF. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the\nDOD on September 1, 2006.1\n1 Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (SEAD 4), was issued on December 10, 2016, revising the 2006 \nadjudicative guidelines for all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017.  \n01/18/2019\n\n2 \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 8, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 9, 2018. On September \n19, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the \nhearing was scheduled for October 18, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through H, which were \nadmitted without objection. At Applicant\u2019s request, I kept the record open until November \n19, 2018, for additional submissions. Applicant submitted (AX) I (a packet of documents) \nin a timely manner. The exhibits was entered into the record without objection. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on October 25, 2018. The record closed on November 20, \n2018. \n \nFindings of Fact2 \n \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has worked for \ndefense contractors for about 10 years. Applicant graduated from high school in 1992.  \nHe is currently working two jobs. He has held a security clearance since 2006. Applicant \ndivorced his first wife in 2002. He remarried and has four minor children and two adult \nchildren. \n \nFinancial \n \n \nThe SOR alleges in  1.a-1.l, a 2005 chapter 7 bankruptcy which was discharged in \n2006; failure to file Federal and state income tax returns for at least tax years 2007 \nthrough 2016; delinquent state taxes in the amount of $16,780; delinquent Federal taxes \nin the amount of $43,717; a 2011 state tax lien in the amount of $7,975; a 2009 Federal \ntax lien in the amount of $16,528; and seven collection accounts totaling about $5,245. \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged that the 2005 bankruptcy was the result of his divorce and \nthat it was discharged in 2006. (SOR 1.a)  He explained that a custody battle ensued until \n2012, and as a result he incurred legal fees and other expenses. Applicant agreed that \nhe did not file his Federal or state income tax returns from tax years 2007 through 2016, \nas required. (SOR 1.b) He disputed the amount of the state delinquent taxes as well as \nthe Federal delinquent taxes. (SOR 1.c and 1.d) He presented documentation that \nbeginning in 2017, he started a payment agreement with the state for money due in the \namount of $10,960. The agreement calls for $327.43 monthly for 36 months. (AX E) The \nrecord did not contain any payment receipts under this agreement. \n \n \nAs to SOR 1.f, a 2011 state tax lien in the amount of $7,975, Applicant submitted \na Release of tax lien, dated May 2018. (AX F) As to SOR 1.g, a Federal tax lien in the \namount of $16,528, Applicant submitted a Certificate of Release, dated February 2018. \n(AX C) \n \n                                                          \n2 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (GX 1) unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n \n\n3 \n \n \nApplicant could not explain why he did not timely file his Federal and state income \ntax returns. (Tr. 41) He began filing them in 2010 and 2017. (GX 2) He believed that for \nsome of the tax years, he asked for an extension, but he could provide no documentation. \nIt does appear from an email that in 2009, he requested an extension of time for that year. \n(AX I) At this time, all the tax returns from 2007 through 2016 have been filed. (GX 2) \n \n \nApplicant contacted Nationwide tax negotiators in 2008, but there is no \ndocumentation that he made any payments. In late 2009, Applicant contacted American \nTax Solutions (Tax Defenders). It appears from documentation that Applicant started a \npayment plan with the IRS.The payments were $50 a month. He made approximately four \npayments. Applicant received a notice from them that as of January 2010, the IRS wanted \nto collect $20,374. In 2011, Applicant\u2019s wages were garnished for a judgment. (AXI) At \nsome point in time, Applicant contacted OPTIMA and began addressing his IRS tax \nliabilities. (AX D)   \n \n \nApplicant has been in a staggered installment agreement with the IRS for tax years \n2010-2016 since 2018 according to the OPTIMA report. (AX D). Since July 2018, \nApplicant has paid the IRS $10,200. ( AX D) This report reflects three payments made to \nthe IRS starting in July 2018. A payment of $300 was made in July and in August 2018. \n(AX B, D)  Another payment of $9,600 was made in July 2018. The report has several \npages missing. One pages states that Applicant asked for an extension for the 2017 tax \nreturn. (AX D) It appears from this report that Applicant still owes about $44,000 in \ndelinquent debt to the Federal government. Applicant did not provide tax transcripts as \npromised as part of his post-hearing submission packet. \n \n \nApplicant denied all the financial SOR allegations concerning the collection \naccounts in SOR 1.e, 1.h hrough 1.l. The reasons that he gave for the denials of the \nvarious collection accounts were that he was not aware of the accounts. (Tr. 77) He also \nstated that the accounts are no longer on his credit report. Applicant also recalls \nsuccessfully disputing some accounts. Applicant had no receipts for any bills that he \nbelieved he paid.(SOR)   Applicant had no documentation that he paid any of the debts, \nexcept for presenting a partial credit report that showed certain debts had been removed \nfrom his report. (AX I ) Applicant could not find any other receipts for debts he believed \nhe had paid. Several times, Appplicant stated that he presented relevant documentation \nto the investigators. (Tr. 77) \n \n \nApplicant has not received financial counseling. He earns about $150,000 from \none job and about $53 an hour from another job. (Tr.32)  His wife is a federal employee \nearining about $160,00 a year.  He has a retirement account of about $12,000 and about \n$2,000 in savings.  He purchased a home in 2018 for $520,000, making a down payment \nof $30,000. He obtained extra money from the home loan and paid $9,600 to the IRS in \nJuly 2018. (Tr. 74)  His monthly mortgage is $5,000 a month.   His child support payments \nended in 2012.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n4 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \n\n5 \n \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, and failure to pay \nFederal  and state taxes that became delinquent, establish three disqualifying conditions \nunder this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d); AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations\u201d); and 19(f) (\u201dfailure to file . . .  or pay annual Federal,  state, \nor local ..income tax returns as required.\u201d \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n\n6 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20 (g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant  has a history of not filing his Federal and state tax income returns in a \ntimely manner as required by law. For multiple years going back to at least 2007 through \n2016. Applicant did not file for any articulated good reason. AG 20(a) does not apply.  He \nwas divorced and that contributed to his 2005 bankruptcy, but delinquent Federal and \nstate tax liens and delinquent debt went on for many years. He explained various attempts \nhe made with various tax negotiators, but his installment plan with the IRS began in 2018. \nHe had Federal and state liens, which he has paid, but recently. As to the collection \naccounts, Applicant disputed them or stated that they were paid, but provided no \ndocumentation other than a part of a credit report that showed some accounts had been \nremoved. It is not known whether they were paid or fell off due to passage of time. He \nwas given time to produce receipts, but he did not. AG 20(b) only partially applies because \nI do not find that his attempts to work with various tax negotiators for many years without \na durable payment plan, shows that he acted responsibly. He paid his Federal and state \nliens and receives credit for doing so. The arrangements that Applicant made with the \nIRS started in 2018. He has no track record. The tax liability is about $44,000. Considering \nthe recency of his payment plan, his financial situation is not under control at this time. \nAG 20 (c) and (g) do not fully apply. \n \n \n.Applicant has not received financial counseling and did not provide a budget. He \nand his wife are employed. He bought a home in 2018 and his mortgage is $5,000 a \nmonth.  He has presented insufficient information to show that he has  the problems under \ncontrol. Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concern.  \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n\n7 \n \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nApplicant has held a security clearance since 2006 and worked in the contracting \nfield for a number of years. He was divorced in 2002 and filed bankruptcy as a result of \nthe divorce and legal bills. Due to a long passage of time the bankruptcy is found in his \nfavor. He paid the Federal and state tax liens recently. However, his failure to timely file \nhis Federal and state income tax returns for so many years with no real explanation \nprovides me with doubts as to his judgment and responsibility. He has begun a payment \nagreement plan with the IRS in 2018. This is too soon to provide mitigation. He had \ncollection accounts and claims that they have been disputed or have been removed from \nhis credit report. This does not provide mitigation in this case. Applicant was confused \nabout some of the tax years that he did not file and believes that since he has been \nattempting to work with various tax negotiators for years that he has shown good faith \nefforts. He is working two jobs and his wife is employed. He still owes a sizeable amount \nof money to the IRS. He recently purchased a $500,000 home and put $30,000 for a down \npayment, which suggests he has ample resources  to address his tax and non-tax debts. \nHe did use some money from the closing to pay an amount for taxes. \n \n \nHe is making some strides with his delinquent taxes and paid two liens but he has \nnot presented sufficient information to mitigate the security concerns raised by his \nfinancial considerations security concerns \n \n. \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b-e: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f-g: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h-l:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n8 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Small debts were satisfied in late 2017, but he still owes past-due Federal \nincome taxes exceeding $80,000 and a credit-card debt that was charged-off for $34,264. \nMore progress is needed toward resolving those debts. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn October 20, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR explained why the DOD \nCAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n\n2 \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on November 9, 2017, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA).1 \nOn February 19, 2018, Applicant separated from his employment requiring a security \nclearance. He subsequently regained sponsorship for security clearance eligibility, and on \nNovember 1, 2018, his case was assigned to an administrative judge to conduct a hearing \nto determine whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for Applicant. On January 9, 2019, the case was transferred to me for a \nhearing. On January 16, 2019, I scheduled a hearing for February 13, 2019. \n \nAt the hearing, the SOR was amended without objection at the request of the \nGovernment. Five Government exhibits (GEs A-E) were admitted.2 GE D, a credit report \ndated July 31, 2017, was admitted over Applicant\u2019s objections. A December 17, 2017 letter \n(HE 1) forwarding the proposed GEs to Applicant and a list of the GEs (HE II) were marked \nas hearing exhibits (HE) for the record but not admitted in evidence. A binder of documents \nfrom Applicant, containing tabs 1-15, was marked collectively as AE 1. Applicant testified, \nas reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on February 27, 2019. \n \n \nApplicant provided me with two additional documents at the hearing consisting of a \nsummary of his qualifications (AE 2) and bank statements covering the dates from July 25, \n2017, through October 23, 2017 (AE 3). I had indicated that I would incorporate the \ndocuments in the record, but then did not clearly address their inclusion within AE 1. On \nApril 17, 2019, I advised the parties that, as a matter of clarification, the documents would \nbe marked for identification as separate exhibits AEs 2 and 3. Neither party had any \nobjection. Accordingly, the summary and bank statements were admitted in evidence. \n  \nRuling on Pleadings \n \n \nBefore the introduction of any evidence, Department Counsel moved to amend the \nSOR to add a Guideline E, personal conduct, security concern based on evidence to be \npresented by Applicant indicating that he had received psychological counseling from July \n2010 to May 2014, which was not disclosed on his security clearance application (e-QIP). \nApplicant did not object to the amendment and declined the opportunity for time to \nrespond, including continuing or reconvening the hearing at a future date to address the \nallegation. Accordingly, the SOR was amended to allege under AG \u00b6 2(a) as follows: \n \n You provided materially false information in your answers to an Electronic \nQuestionnaire for Investigations Processing signed by you on September 2, \n2015. In response to Section 21 \u2014 Psychological and Emotional Health . . . \nIn the last seven years, have you consulted with a healthcare professional \nregarding an emotional or mental health condition? . . . You answered No, \n                                                 \n1 Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR allegations bears a typewritten date of November 11, 2017, but it was \nnotarized on November 9, 2017. There was no explanation for the discrepancy. \n \n2 At the request of Department Counsel, the Government\u2019s exhibits were marked by letter because Applicant \nhad pre-marked his exhibits by number. A decision was then made to mark Applicant\u2019s exhibits collectively as \nAE 1. \n\n3 \n \nwhen, in fact, you were treated by Dr. [name omitted] from at least July 2010 \nthrough May 2014 for depression and anxiety. \n \nSummary of SOR Allegations \n \n \nThe amended SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant had lost a property to \nforeclosure in 2013 because of his inability to make his monthly mortgage payment (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a), and that as of October 20, 2017, he owed the following delinquencies: a $34,264 \ncharged-off account (SOR \u00b6 1.b); a $1,111 charged-off credit card (SOR \u00b6 1.c); \ntelecommunications collection debts of $308 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) and $283 (SOR \u00b6 1.e); a $25 \nmedical collection debt (SOR \u00b6 1.f); Federal income taxes for 2014 of $8,226 (SOR \u00b6 1.g) \nand for 2015 of $61,862 (SOR \u00b6 1.h); and state income taxes for $3,108 (SOR \u00b6 1.j). Also \nunder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly had not yet filed his Federal income tax return for \ntax year 2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.i). Under Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have falsified his \nSeptember 2015 Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) by not \ndisclosing his mental health counseling from July 2010 through May 2014. \n \n \nWhen Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, he explained that the \nforeclosure of his mortgage loan (SOR \u00b6 1.a) was because of his divorce. He indicated that \nhe had fully paid the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.f, and his state tax debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j; that he \nhad a repayment arrangement in place for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b; and that he was in the \nprocess of making an installment agreement with the IRS to address his Federal tax \ndelinquencies in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h. He denied SOR \u00b6 1.i because he had filed his \nFederal income tax return for tax year 2013, albeit late. He volunteered that he owed \nFederal income taxes for tax year 2013, which he planned to repay under an installment \nagreement with the IRS. Applicant attributed his financial issues to his separation, divorce, \nand foreclosure, and to 19 months of unemployment from December 2014 to July 2016. As \nfor the personal conduct allegation, Applicant admitted that he had received the counseling \nas alleged, but he denied that he intentionally lied on his e-QIP. He explained that he \nviewed his counseling as related to marital and family issues, and believed it was not \nrequired to be reported under Section 21 of the form. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n  \n \nApplicant is a 53-year-old college graduate. He served in the enlisted ranks in the \nNational Guard from February 1990 to February 1993, while also working as a Federal \nemployee from July 1990 to December 1994. (GE A.) He held a top secret clearance and \nsensitive compartmented information (SCI) eligibility from August 1990 to late November \n2014. (Tr. 60.) Applicant has worked for his current defense-contractor employer since \nAugust 2018. (Tr. 56, 58.) He was previously employed by the company from December \n1995 to June 2012. According to his former supervisor, Applicant held his security \nclearance without any issue for the duration of his tenure at the company. (AE 1 Tab 12.) \n\n4 \n \n \nApplicant married in November 1998. He and his now ex-wife had two sons, who are \n16 and 13. (GE A; AE 1 Tab 13; Tr. 62.) He and his ex-wife began having marital problems \nin 2008. (Tr. 61.) In late July 2010, Applicant began treatment with a licensed professional \ncounselor also licensed in marriage and family therapy. (AE 1 Tab 12; Tr. 65.) He and his \nspouse attended two or three sessions as a couple, but his ex-wife was not interested in \npursuing marital counseling. (Tr. 68.) \n \nApplicant and his ex-wife separated in July 2011. (AE 1 Tab 13; Tr. 61.) Applicant \nmoved into an apartment, and his ex-wife continued to reside in the marital residence with \ntheir two sons for another year. (Tr. 41.) In January 2012, on his attorney\u2019s advice, \nApplicant began paying spousal and child support totaling $5,007 per month (child support \nof $1,204 and spousal support of $3,803) on his gross income of $12,933 per month. (GEs \nB, E; AE 1 Tabs 3, 8, 15; Tr. 61) Applicant defaulted on a credit-card account (SOR \u00b6 1.b) \nafter July 2011, and the creditor eventually charged off his account for $34,264. (GE D-E.) \nApplicant could not maintain his support obligations and living expenses if he paid the \ncredit card. (Tr. 96.) \n \nIn approximately February 2012, Applicant\u2019s then employer laid off some managerial \nstaff. Applicant took a reduction in salary of $25,000 so that he could stay on for a few \nmonths until June 2012. (GE A.) Applicant began a new job almost immediately as a senior \nprincipal systems engineer with another defense contractor. (GE A; AE 1 Tab 2.) On \nannual wages totaling $129,498 in 2012, he paid $44,705 in alimony. (AE 1 Tabs 7-8.) \n \nApplicant and his ex-wife were divorced in February 2013. On his monthly gross \nsalary of $12,833, Applicant agreed to pay spousal support for his wife for seven years \nfrom February 2013, initially at $3,400 per month and then declining by $200 each year \nthereafter, subject to recalculation should his earnings decline by 10% or more from a \nstipulated $148,000 in gross income and his ex-wife\u2019s earnings equal or exceed $40,000 \nannually. Applicant also agreed to pay child support of $1,174 per month starting in \nFebruary 2013 for his sons, to terminate when his sons turn 18 or graduate from high \nschool or are not self-supporting and not yet 19 years old. (AE 1 Tabs 8, 13; Tr. 62-65.) In \ntheir divorce settlement, Applicant and his ex-wife were held fully responsible for their own \ndebts. They agreed on joint legal custody of their sons, with his ex-wife being the primary \ncustodial parent. (AE 1 Tab 14.) For income tax purposes, Applicant was entitled to claim \ntheir older son as a dependent. (AE 1 Tab 13.) \n \n \nAt the time of their divorce, Applicant and his ex-wife jointly owned their marital \nresidence, which was encumbered by a deed of trust securing payment of a joint note \n(mortgage) in the approximate amount of $449,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Applicant was liable for a \nhome-equity line of credit (HELOC) obtained in February 2006 for $167,671 to add a porch \nand for landscaping. (Tr. 45.) Neither Applicant nor his ex-wife made the payments on the \nmortgage or the HELOC after July 2012. Applicant could not afford to make the payments. \n(Tr. 43.) His rent was $1,850 per month (AE 1 Tab 12), and he had incurred $20,000 to \n$30,000 in legal fees for his divorce. (Tr. 97.) A buyer was willing to purchase the home in \na short sale, but the HELOC remained in collections, and they lost the buyer. In April 2013, \nthe primary lender foreclosed on the property. The house sold at auction in May 2013 to \n\n5 \n \nresolve the first mortgage. The HELOC with a balance of $167,852, was not resolved in the \nforeclosure. (GEs B, E; AE 1 Tabs 2-3, 13; Tr. 41.)  \n \n \nApplicant became very depressed, despite ongoing counseling with his therapist for \ndepression and anxiety. He had 111 counseling sessions between July 2010 and May \n2014. His therapist reports that he was late reporting for work at times, and was \ndisorganized in his thinking. (AE 1 Tab 12.) He stopped checking his mail, and he did not \nfile his income tax returns when they were due for tax year 2013. (AE B; Tr. 78.) Applicant \nunderstood that he should he filed his return even if he could not pay the taxes owed. He \nexplained that he \u201cwas in a pretty dark place . . . and for a period of time there had a hard \ntime just making it to and from work.\u201d (Tr. 42.) Collection debts of $308 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) and \n$283 (SOR \u00b6 1.e) owed to a cable television and Internet provider since 2012 went unpaid. \n(GE E.) Applicant had boxed up the cable equipment when he moved from an apartment \nand then forgot about it. (Tr. 47.) \n    \nIn August 2014, Applicant started a new job at gross income of $13,000 a month. In \nNovember 2014, he left that employment under mutual agreement following alleged \nmisconduct. Applicant admits that, in September 2014, he lied about being at a company \nsite when he was at home. He had charged his time to the contract. (GE A.) \n \nApplicant was unemployed from December 2014 through June 2016. He made little \neffort to look for a job before September 2015 \u201cby choice.\u201d (GE A; AE 1 Tab 2.) When \nasked about his lengthy unemployment, he testified that he \u201cwas completely burned out\u201d \n(Tr. 74), but then also indicated that he \u201cwas taking it easy and was living life and pursuing \nhappiness.\u201d (Tr. 77.) He supported himself largely by taking approximately $250,000 in \n401(k) withdrawals, which had income implications of $223,687 for tax year 2015. (AE 1 \nTab 7; Tr. 75-76.) Applicant did not set aside any funds to pay his taxes or penalties for the \nearly withdrawals from his 401(k). (Tr. 76.) He continued to default on some financial \naccounts. He made no payments on a credit card (SOR \u00b6 1.c) after November 2014, and \nthe creditor charged off his account for $1,111. (GEs C-D.) In January 2015, a medical \ncreditor placed a $25 debt for collection (SOR \u00b61.f). (GE E.) On July 29, 2015, the creditor \nholding the defaulted HELOC issued a 1099-C, Cancellation of Debt form, for $167,671. \n(AE 1 Tab 7.) Available checking account statements from that time are incomplete, but \nthey show that he made several PayPal purchases for gaming in 2015 as the aforesaid \ndebts went unpaid. (AE 1 Tab 10.) \n \nOn September 2, 2015, Applicant completed an e-QIP in application for a security \nclearance to commence work as a systems engineer for a consulting group. He disclosed \nthat he had not filed his Federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2013 and 2014 \ndue to \u201csimple neglect\u201d on his part. Applicant estimated that he was owed tax refunds from \nthe IRS and state for the tax years because of his spousal support. He described his life as \n\u201csomewhat overwhelming for the last several years,\u201d and expressed a plan to file his \nreturns and pay any penalties by the end of September 2014. In response to any \ndelinquency involving enforcement in the last seven years, Applicant listed the HELOC on \nhis marital home that he was unable to repay because of his support obligations and \npayments to his lawyer. Applicant also responded affirmatively to whether he owed any \n\n6 \n \ndelinquency on routine accounts. He listed credit card debts of $17,000 (not alleged)3 and \n$34,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and the HELOC, which he indicated was in collection. He explained \nhis financial problems, stating in part: \n \nAll of the financial problems begin [sic] as a result of my separation and \ndivorce from my ex-wife. Prior to then my bill[s] were paid on time. We were \nunderwater on our house after the market collapsed but home life became \nunbearable so I moved out. I could not sustain two households on my \nincome; as a result debts mounted, including $30,000 in legal fees. I agreed \nto take the second mortgage and two credit card bills if she would take the \nother four. My thinking at the time was that I would declare bankruptcy but I \nhave not done so yet. . . . I\u2019ve opt[ed] to walk away from the debts instead \nand to pay them after I\u2019m done paying spousal support. I am paying my \nlawyer and my [creditor name omitted] bill, but not the [routine delinquencies \nlisted on his SF 86]. (GE A.) \n \n \nApplicant responded negatively on his e-QIP to an inquiry in section 21 concerning \nwhether he had consulted with a health care professional regarding an emotional or mental \nhealth condition in the last seven years. (GE A.) Instructed to respond \u201cNo\u201d if the \ncounseling was \u201cstrictly marital, family, grief not related to violence by you\u201d and not court-\nordered, Applicant testified that he \u201chonestly felt [his] counseling was related to his \nmarriage.\u201d (Tr. 55.) On cross-examination, he admitted that he was treated for anxiety and \ndepression as well as for marital issues, and that of his 111 sessions with the therapist, \nonly two or three were with his ex-wife. (Tr. 67-69.) Applicant elaborated about his state of \nmind as follows: \n \nSo I think a lot of the result\u2014the impact of what happens to me was as a \nresult of my marriage. And I think working and living within a family was also \npart of that. And so when I answered no I thought of it as being a legitimate \nanswer of, I was trying to repair myself because of the injury that had \noccurred to me because of my marriage and because of how I was working \nwithin a family and having to take care of children who had just been through \na divorce as well. (Tr. 70-71.) \n \nHowever, Applicant also acknowledged that his counseling was not strictly related to his \nmarital and family issues. He admitted that \u201c[he] did not pay close attention in answering \nthat question and [he] should have.\u201d (Tr. 71.) \n \n \nIn January 2016, Applicant\u2019s ex-wife began earning a salary of $4,083 per month. \nThere was no adjustment to his child support or spousal support obligations to \naccommodate for her income. Applicant asserts that he overpaid his spousal support by \n$10,000 to $15,000 as a result, but he did not pursue his ex-wife for the overpayment \nbecause he had fallen behind in his spousal support in June 2016 and July 2016. He had \n                                                 \n3 Available creditor records show that the lender cancelled debt of $10,502 on December 31, 2015. (AE 1 Tab \n7.) \n \n\n7 \n \npaid only $826 of his then $2,800 monthly spousal support obligation. In July 2016, \nApplicant began working as a systems engineer for a defense contractor at a gross \nmonthly salary of $14,166. Between August 2016 and January 2017, Applicant paid extra \nto catch up on his spousal support. (GE C; AE 1 Tabs 4, 8; Tr. 52-53.) \n \nRealizing that he had to file his delinquent federal and state income tax returns for \ntax years 2013 through 2015, Applicant hired a professional tax service in early October \n2016. The tax preparer finished his Federal income tax return for those tax years in \nOctober 2016. Applicant assets that he filed his delinquent tax returns in October 2016 (Tr. \n43, 77), although IRS tax transcripts show that his returns for 2014 and 2015 were not \nreceived until November 17, 2016. On wages of $141,059, he paid $40,800 in alimony, so \nhis adjusted gross income for 2013 was reduced to $100,259. He underpaid his Federal \nincome taxes for 2013 by $4,328.4 On adjusted gross income of $105,131 for tax year \n2014, he owed $7,028 with penalties and interest. Even though he was unemployed for the \nentire year of 2015, he calculated his Federal tax debt at $44,380 for 2015 because of \ncancelled debt and the premature withdrawal of his 401(k) on reported adjusted gross \nincome of $265,887.5  (GE B; AE 1 Tabs 7-8.) \n \nOn October 20, 2016, Applicant was notified that he owed state income taxes of \n$3,108 (SOR \u00b6 1.j). Applicant indicates that the taxes were owed for 2012, although \ndocumentation indicates that his tax liability was for tax year 2015. On his state tax return \nfor tax year 2014 submitted with the assistance of the tax service, he claimed a refund of \n$2,051. (AE 1 Tab 7.) In December 2016, he was assessed a state tax liability of $4,385 \nfor tax year 2015. His wages were levied at $150 every two weeks starting in May 2017 for \nhis state tax delinquency. (AE 1 Tab 4; Tr. 83-84.) \n \nOn January 31, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for \nthe Office of Personnel Management (OPM). He indicated that he had filed his delinquent \ntax returns for tax years 2013 through 2015 in October 2016, but that the IRS could not \nprocess his return for 2013 because he was missing a required 8332 form from his ex-wife \nso that he could claim their older son as a dependent on his income tax return. (GE C; Tr. \n44.) Applicant admitted that he owed Federal income taxes of approximately $5,442 for \n2014 and $44,380 for 2015. He also acknowledged that he had become $4,358 delinquent \non his spousal support in May 2016 and June 2016, but he paid off the arrearage at $626 \nper month from July 2016 to January 2017. About his HELOC and credit-card \ndelinquencies, Applicant indicated that his debts would be cancelled and become \n\u201cunrealized income\u201d for income tax purposes. He did not recognize the collection debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.f. (GE C.) \n \n                                                 \n4 Applicant provided no evidence to corroborate that his 2013 Federal income tax return was filed with his \n2014 and 2015 income tax returns in October or November 2016, but the return was signed by the tax \npreparer on October 10, 2016, and by Applicant on October 12, 2016. (AE 1 Tab 7.) \n \n5 The cancellation of his HELOC led him to incur a significant tax liability for tax year 2015. He included as \nincome $78,174 (cancelled debt less the equity in the property) in cancelled debt on his Federal income tax \nreturn for tax year 2015. His remaining tax liability came from the 401(k) transactions in 2015. (GE B; AE 1 \nTab 7; Tr. 83.) \n\n8 \n \nFrom February 2017 through February 2018, Applicant paid child support of $1,539 \nper month. He paid $2,235 monthly in spousal support from February 2017 through May \n2017; $2,146 in June 2017; $2,057 monthly from July 2017 through October 2017; $1,853 \nin November 2017; $1,645 each in December 2017 and January 2018, but only $87 in \nFebruary 2018. (AE 1 Tab 8.)  \n \nApplicant filed his Federal income tax return for tax year 2016 on time in April 2017. \nOn adjusted gross income of $61,945, he was entitled to a $13,225 refund that was applied \nby the IRS to taxes Applicant owed for tax year 2012. (GE B; AE 1 Tab 7; Tr. 43.) In May \n2017, he re-filed his tax return for tax year 2013 with the IRS. (Tr. 78.) \n \nIn response to DOD CAF interrogatories, Applicant indicated on September 11, \n2017, that he owed a significant amount in Federal and state income taxes, largely \nbecause of the delayed impact of his defaulted HELOC and the taxes and penalty on the \ndistribution of his 401(k) while he was unemployed. He explained that his nonpayment of \ntaxes was \u201cnot one of intent, but one of means, and a lack of understanding about a \ncleared path forward.\u201d Applicant provided IRS tax transcripts for tax years 2014 and 2015 \nshowing unpaid balances of $8,226 for tax year 2014 and $61,863 for tax year 2015 as of \nSeptember 2017. He submitted a notice from the IRS of a request for more information \nbefore it could provide a tax transcript for 2013. A collection notice from the state showed a \nbalance due of $3,108. Applicant submitted a personal financial statement indicating that \nthe state had levied against his wages and was taking $300 a month to address his state \ntax liability. He estimated his net monthly discretionary income at $743. (GE B.) \n \n On October 25, 2017, Applicant paid his $308 cable bill in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.d). \nOn October 26, 2017, he paid the $25 medical debt in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.f). On October \n30, 2017, Applicant made a final payment of $2,317 to fully resolve his state tax \ndelinquency for tax year 2015 under a tax amnesty program. On October 21, 2017, \nApplicant authorized recurring payments of $50 every two weeks from his checking \naccount from November 2017 to April 2018 toward his $34,264 credit-card delinquency \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b). He indicated in response to the SOR that he would renew the payments until \nthe debt is paid. (AE A Tab 3.) At his hearing, he testified that he has not missed any \npayments since entering into the agreement. (Tr. 98.) On November 6, 2017, he returned \nthe cable equipment to resolve the collection debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e. On November 9, 2017, he \nsatisfied the $1,111 credit-card delinquency (SOR \u00b6 1.c). (AE 1 Tabs 3-4; Tr. 84, 95.) \nAbout the delayed resolution, Applicant testified that he was overwhelmed with his debts, \nand it \u201cjust got lost in the chaos.\u201d (Tr. 99.) Applicant admitted that he was irresponsible and \nshould have addressed his debts sooner. (Tr. 102.) Available checking account statements \nfor Applicant covering the period July 25, 2017, through October 23, 2017, show that \nApplicant made several purchases for gaming and ITunes before his delinquencies were \npaid. (AE 3.) \n \nAs of October 2017, Applicant owed the IRS approximately $89,105 for tax years \n2012 through 2015 ($10,534 for 2012, $6,403 for 2013, $8,458 for 2014, and $63,708 for \n2015). (AE 1 Tab 4.) The issuance of the SOR on October 20, 2017, prompted him to \ncontact the IRS on November 30, 2017, about an installment plan to repay his substantial \n\n9 \n \ntax delinquency.6 (AE 1 Tab 6; Tr. 79.) On December 12, 2017, Applicant entered into an \ninstallment agreement to pay his Federal income tax delinquency at $524 per month. He \nmade payments of $417 and $524 in February 2018 and $524 in March 2018 that were \napplied to his tax liability for 2012. Payments of $524 in April 2018 and again in May 2018 \nwere applied to his income tax liability for tax year 2014. (AE 1 Tabs 5-6.) \n \nIn February 2018, Applicant was laid off from his job paying him approximately \n$170,000 a year. (Tr. 72-73.) Security clearance and access requests had been submitted \nfor Applicant, but they had not been granted, and he was let go for lack of unclassified \nwork. (AE 1 Tab 12.) He paid nothing in spousal or child support while he was unemployed. \n(AE 1 Tab 8.) In April 2018, he moved in with his parents because he was unemployed. \n(AE 1 Tab 2.) \n \nApplicant filed his income tax returns for tax year 2017 on time. (Tr. 43, 85.) On \nadjusted gross income of $137,203, he expected a tax refund of $13,147. (AE 1 Tab 7.) In \nJuly 2018, he received notice from the IRS that his Federal tax liability for tax year 2012 \nhad been satisfied, but he still owed Federal income taxes of $6,580 for 2013, $3,885 for \n2014, and $68,903 for 2015. In August 2018, Applicant began working for his current \nemployer at a monthly income of approximately $12,916, and he renewed his support \npayments. (AE 1 Tabs 2, 8-9; Tr. 56, 58, 72.) He contacted the IRS to resume his \ninstallment agreement at $524 per month, but no payments were deducted from his bank \naccount. In November 2017, the IRS notified him of its intention to cancel his installment \nagreement for failure to provide income verification to the IRS (Collection Information \nStatement Form 433-F) that he had not realized was required. He submitted the form in \nDecember 2017, but processing was delayed because of the partial government shutdown \nover the holidays. In late January 2019, the IRS returned his debt to collections. (Tr. 49.) \nOn February 7, 2019, Applicant executed a new Installment Agreement Request with the \nIRS, proposing to repay $81,383 at $525 per month. (AE 1 Tabs 2, 5-6.) As of Applicant\u2019s \nhearing in mid-February 2019, Applicant was awaiting a response from the IRS about his \nproposed installment plan. (Tr. 81-82.) Applicant intends to repay his tax delinquency. (Tr. \n45.) His income tax returns for 2018 were not yet prepared as of February 2019, so he was \nunsure whether he would owe taxes for 2018. (Tr. 85.) \n \nIn October or November 2018, Applicant\u2019s car was \u201ctotaled\u201d by a fallen tree. He \nobtained a $23,000 loan for a 2018 model-year vehicle that he is repaying at $560 per \nmonth. (Tr. 87-88.) As of February 2019, Applicant was paying his parents $500 a month to \ncover rent and monies given him previously. He was current on his spousal and child \nsupport. (Tr. 65.) He testified that he had about $5,000 after paying his car loan, support \nobligations, and parents, but that did not include his other expenses, such as food, \ngasoline, or car insurance. (Tr. 91.)  He had approximately $6,000 in savings to move back \nto his previous state of residency to be near his sons. He believes he can obtain a job \ntransfer with his current employer, although it would be predicated on him being granted \n                                                 \n6 Applicant testified that he owed the IRS as much as $96,000 at one point, but that his tax liability has been \nreduced by $26,000 through the IRS interception of his tax refunds for tax years 2016 and 2017. (Tr. 51.) He \nexpressed his belief that he had made some tax payments before the October to November 2017 time frame \n(Tr. 82), although he provided no documentation of any such payments. \n\n10 \n \naccess to SCI. The transfer would likely mean an increase of $1,500 in his monthly \nexpenses, although he estimated that he would likely still have a monthly surplus of $896. \n(Tr. 86-93.) His spousal support is scheduled to end in January 2020. (AE A 1 Tab 8.) He \nthen plans to pay an additional $1,200 per month toward his IRS debt. (Tr. 93.) He \nestimates that it is going to take him more than six years to satisfy his Federal income tax \ndelinquency. (Tr. 94.) \n \nApplicant owes his divorce attorney $13,000 to $14,000. He testified that he has \nbeen paying about $100 a month consistently, except when he was unemployed between \nNovember 2014 and July 2016. Applicant stated that his attorney is allowing him to make \npayments when he is able. (Tr. 97-98.) Available checking account statements show $200 \npayments on May 26, 2015, and February 22, 2016. (AE 1 Tab 10.) His checking account \nactivity from July 25, 2017, through October 23, 2017, shows one payment to his divorce \nattorney during those three months, of $75 on July 28, 2017. (AE 3.) He did not provide \nany documentation of the claimed $100 consistent payments. \n  \nOver the years, Applicant\u2019s parents have given him about $18,000. When he was \nshort of funds, they gave him about $4,000 to pay his spousal and child support. They paid \nabout $2,000 for him to put his belongings in storage in April 2018. They purchased \nfurnishings for him in the past. He started repaying them at $1,500 a paycheck in August \n2017, but he recently reduced the amount to $500. (Tr. 103-104.) \n \nApplicant provided favorable character reference letters from three former co-\nworkers who had ample opportunity to observe his work during his previous tenure with his \ncurrent employer. They attest to Applicant\u2019s dedication to their mission and to Applicant\u2019s \nrecognition and protection of sensitive data. In their experience, Applicant had a \u201cunique \ncombination of analytic experience and technical skills.\u201d (AE 1 Tab 12.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n\n11 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \n\n12 \n \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, available credit reports, and IRS and state tax records \nestablish the mortgage foreclosure and the delinquencies in the SOR. Regarding his \nalleged failure to file his Federal income tax return for tax year 2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.i), Applicant \nfiled his return late, although the Government did not meet its burden of establishing that it \nwas unfiled as of the issuance of the SOR on October 20, 2017. Applicant\u2019s tax returns for \ntax years 2013 through 2015 were completed by a professional tax service in October \n2016, and it is likely that he filed the three delinquent returns to the IRS shortly thereafter. \nApplicant has consistently maintained that his return for tax year 2013 was rejected by the \nIRS for the lack of the form authorizing him to claim his older son as a dependent on his \nreturn, and that he refiled his Federal income tax return for tax year 2013 in May 2017. The \nevidence of substantial Federal income tax delinquency is undisputed. Disqualifying \nconditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations,\u201d and 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required,\u201d \napply.  \n \nApplicant has the burden of establishing matters in mitigation. One or more of the \nfollowing conditions under AG \u00b6 20 may apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \n\n13 \n \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant lost his marital home to foreclosure more than five years ago because of \nhis divorce, which is a circumstance that is not likely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) applies in \nmitigation of the security concerns associated with his failure to make his monthly \nmortgage payment. Applicant stopped paying on the credit cards in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c in \n2011 and 2014, respectively. The cable service debts in collection (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e) \nwere from 2012. The debts were also not incurred recently, but they are not mitigated \nunder AG \u00b6 20(a) because of Applicant\u2019s disregard of those debts before the SOR was \nissued. As for his tax delinquencies, although Applicant began addressing his delinquent \ntax returns in October 2016, available documentation reflects no voluntary payments \ntoward his tax indebtedness before October 2017, when he paid $2,137 to resolve his state \ntax delinquency under a state tax-amnesty program. The state began garnishing his wages \nat $150 per month in May 2017, but those payments pursuant to a tax levy are not \nconsidered voluntary. Applicant\u2019s first payment of record under an installment plan with the \nIRS was made in February 2018. With more than $81,353 in delinquent Federal income \ntaxes still owed as of February 2019, AG \u00b6 20(a) cannot reasonably apply. \n \nApplicant\u2019s marital separation and divorce had a considerable impact on his \nfinances, so AG \u00b6 20(b) has some applicability. In addition to incurring the expenses of a \nseparate residence starting in July 2011, Applicant began paying $5,007 a month in \nspousal and child support. After his divorce was final in February 2013, Applicant\u2019s monthly \nsupport obligation declined to $4,574, but it was still a considerable amount. The delayed \ndebt cancellation of his HELOC in 2015, which he had to report as income on his tax \nreturns for 2015, was not within his control. However, Applicant also made some \nquestionable financial decisions that show he did not act responsibly under the \ncircumstances. He was unemployed \u201cby choice\u201d for many months after resigning from a job \nin November 2014 following his improper billing of time to a contract when he was not at \nwork. He was depressed during his lengthy unemployment. Even so, there were apparently \ntimes when he \u201cwas taking it easy and was living life and pursuing happiness.\u201d His decision \nnot to make a serious effort to find employment is difficult to justify when he had support \nobligations then at $4,174 monthly. His withdrawal of his 401(k) assets with some \n$223,687 in tax implications in 2015 raises concerns about his financial judgment. It should \nhave been enough to cover his expenses, and he did not set aside any funds to pay the \ntaxes on the premature withdrawals. Applicant held employment from July 2016 to \nFebruary 2018 at a job paying him approximately $170,000 a year, and yet he waited until \nthe SOR was issued to address his consumer credit delinquencies. The second component \nof AG \u00b6 20(b) is not satisfied. \n\n14 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) and AG \u00b6 20(d) are partially established because Applicant satisfied the \ndelinquencies in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.f and 1.j between late October 2017 and early November \n2017. There is no evidence that Applicant was pursued for any balance on the foreclosed \nmortgage loan in SOR \u00b6 1.a. AG \u00b6 20(g) has some applicability because Applicant filed his \ndelinquent tax returns, including for the 2013 tax year alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i, before the SOR \nwas issued, and he satisfied his state tax delinquency with a payment on October 30, \n2017. Applicant has not had the credit counseling required under AG \u00b6 20(c), however. \n \nApplicant expressed an intention to resolve the remaining debts in the SOR. He \nauthorized recurring payments of $50 twice monthly toward the credit card debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.b from November 14, 2017, through April 3, 2018. There is no documentation showing \nthat he continued to make those payments, although he testified that he has missed no \npayments as of February 2019. Even assuming that he has made 15 or 16 months of \npayments, he owes more than $30,000 on the credit-card debt. He entered into an \ninstallment agreement in December 2017 with the IRS to address his $89,924 income tax \ndelinquency. He provided evidence of payments totaling $2,513 between February 2018 \nand May 2018, but he stopped paying the IRS after he was laid off in July 2018. His debt \nwent into collections, apparently because he did not realize that he had to submit a new \nincome verification form. Because of the partial government shutdown, paperwork he \nsubmitted in December 2018 was not processed timely. As of February 2019, he was \nawaiting IRS approval of a newly submitted installment plan to address his $81,383 in \noutstanding Federal income tax delinquency under which he proposes to pay $525 per \nmonth. While neither the layoff in July 2018 nor the partial government shutdown in \nDecember 2018 were within his control, I cannot ignore that Applicant made no efforts to \naddress his delinquencies until they became an issue for his security clearance. The \nAppeal Board recently reaffirmed that an applicant who begins to resolve his debts only \nafter being placed on notice that his clearance was in jeopardy \u201cmay be disinclined to \nfollow rules and regulations when [his] personal interests are not at stake.\u201d See ADP Case \nNo. 17-00263 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 16-03122 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Aug. 17, 2018)). \n \nApplicant is not required to pay off every debt in the SOR to be granted security \nclearance eligibility, but he lacks a sufficient track record of documented payments toward \nthe credit card in SOR \u00b6 1.b and the tax delinquencies in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h for me to \nconclude that he can be counted on to continue to make the promised payments. \nConcerns persist about his financial priorities. Expenditures for gaming and other \nrecreational activities are difficult to justify when he owes more than $80,000 in Federal \nincome taxes, $13,000 to $14,000 to his divorce attorney, and more than $30,000 in \ncharged-off credit card debt. He seemingly can afford to pay more than $50 every two \nweeks toward the credit-card debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b in light of his present income and \nexpenses. Should he proceed with a planned relocation, he expects his monthly expenses \nfor rent and utilities to increase significantly, but he estimates that he would still have $896 \nin discretionary income. He can reasonably be held to have made more progress toward \nreducing his significant debt burden, notwithstanding his large support obligations. The \nfinancial considerations security concerns are only partially mitigated. \n \n\n15 \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern about personal conduct is articulated in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigations or \nadjudicative processes. \n \nApplicant certified to the accuracy of a September 2015 e-QIP on which he \nresponded negatively to an inquiry concerning any mental health counseling in the last \nseven years. Applicant admits, and a reference letter from his therapist shows, that he had \n111 sessions with his therapist from July 2010 to May 2014 for treatment of anxiety and \ndepression prior to and after his divorce. Applicant denies any intention to misrepresent, \nexplaining that he regarded his treatment as marital and family counseling, which was not \nrequired to be reported on the form. The Appeal Board has repeatedly held that, to \nestablish a falsification, it is not enough merely to demonstrate that an applicant\u2019s answers \nwere not true. To raise security concerns under Guideline E, the answers must be \ndeliberately false. In analyzing an applicant\u2019s intent, the administrative judge must consider \nan applicant\u2019s answers in light of the record as a whole. See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 14-\n05005 (App. Bd. Sep. 15, 2017); ISCR Case No. 10-04821 (App. Bd. May 21, 2012). \nApplicant admitted on cross-examination that his treatment was not only for marital \ncounseling, but it was also for his depression. He testified that of his 111 sessions, only two \nor three were jointly with his ex-wife. It is also noted that he continued in counseling after \nhe was divorced, although as he credibly explained, he still had family issues in helping his \nsons cope with their parents\u2019 divorce. There is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s depression or \nanxiety symptoms predated his marital problems, which began in 2008. Applicant could \nreasonably relate his mental health issues to the breakup of the family unit. The evidence \nfalls short of establishing that Applicant knowingly falsified his e-QIP. Accordingly, none of \nthe disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16 are established. Had Applicant intended to \nconceal his mental health issues, he would not have submitted a character reference letter \nfrom his therapist mentioning his treatment. The personal conduct allegation is found for \nApplicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). The analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but \nsome warrant additional comment. \n \nThe security clearance adjudication involves an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in light of the security guidelines in the Directive. \n\n16 \n \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). It is not intended as a debt \ncollection process or designed to punish applicants for past mistakes or shortcomings. See \nISCR Case No. 17-01473 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2018). Applicant handled classified \ninformation appropriately when he held a clearance. At the same time, as someone who \nheld a top secret clearance and SCI access eligibility for many years, Applicant can \nreasonably be expected to have complied with such an important obligation as filing his \nincome tax returns on time, whether or not he could afford to pay the taxes owed. Even \nwhere tax problems have been corrected, the administrative judge is not precluded from \nconsidering an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness in light of prior behavior evidencing \nirresponsibility. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 2015). The Appeal \nBoard has long held that the failure to file tax returns suggests a problem complying with \nwell-established government rules and systems. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04437 (App. \nBd. Apr. 15, 2016). \n \nApplicant\u2019s belated filing of his income tax returns for tax years 2013 through 2015 \nand his timely filing of his 2016 and 2017 income tax returns reflect reform and suggest \nthat he is likely to file his income tax returns on time in the future. Yet, some concerns \nabout his financial judgment persist, as identified above. Based on the evidence before me, \nit would be premature to conclude that his financial problems are sufficiently resolved to \nwhere they no longer present a security risk. \n \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the financial reform and rehabilitation necessary to be eligible for a security \nclearance in the future. After applying the disqualifying and mitigating conditions to the \nevidence presented, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant or continue security clearance eligibility for Applicant at this time.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the amended \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.f: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.h: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i-1.j: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n\n17 \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \n \n \n_____________________ \nElizabeth M.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is an 83-year-old linguist employed by a Department of Defense contractor since May 2016. He is currently stationed overseas. He is applying for a security clearance. He was born, raised, and educated in Iraq. He also attended college and received a bachelor\u2019s degree from a prestigious British University. He has several degrees from Iraqi universities. Applicant served in the Iraqi military attaining the rank of major general. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) He retired in 1984. He is widowed. He and his wife had five children. Two of his sons have passed away.

Edmunds, Esquire \n05/17/2019 \n______________ \n \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nOn November 2, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing  \nsecurity concerns under Guideline B, Foreign Influence. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented within the Department of \nDefense on June 8, 2017. \n  \n \nOn November 26, 2017, Applicant timely answered the SOR and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on \nJanuary 10, 2019. The case was assigned to me on February 7, 2019. On February 13, \n2019, a Notice of Hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for April 2, 2019. The \nhearing was held as scheduled. During the hearing, the Government offered seven   \nexhibits. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 - 7 were admitted without objection. Applicant \noffered 24 exhibits, which were admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \u2013 X, without \nobjection. The Government requested administrative notice be taken of certain facts \nregarding the country of Iraq. The administrative notice document was marked as \nAdministrative Notice Document I (Admin Not I). The record was held open until April \n\n2 \n \n16, 2019, to allow Applicant to submit additional documents. Applicant timely submitted \nAE Y which was admitted without objection. The transcript was received on April 18, \n2019. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access \nto classified information is granted.  \n \nAdministrative Notice  -  Iraq  \n \n \nA coalition of countries led by U.S. and British forces invaded Iraq on March 20, \n2003. Dictator Saddam Hussein was deposed and on May 12, 2003, the United States \nestablished the Coalition Provisional Authority as the interim civil authority in Iraq. About \none year later, the Coalition Provisional Authority transferred sovereignity to the new \nInterim Iraqi Government led by Prime Minister Ayad Allawi. Throughout the governance \nof the Coalition Provisional Authority and the peaceful transfer of power, the role of Iraqi \ninterpreters was vital to U.S. military success. Recognizing the role of local Iraqi \ninterpreters \u2013 and the dangers they faced as a result of their assistance to the United \nStates \u2013 Congress authorized a \u201cSpecial Immigrant Visa\u201d program that allowed local \ninterpreters who served with distinction to immigrate to the United States. (Admin Not II) \n \n \nSince 2005, the U.S. government has approved more than $18.6 billion worth of \nforeign military sales to Iraq. U.S. security assistance supports the development of a \nmodern, accountable, and professional Iraqi military capable of defending Iraq and its \nborders. U.S. security assistance programs also promote civilian oversight of the \nmilitary, adherence to the rule of law, and the respect for human rights, while \nsimultaneously increasing the Iraqi military\u2019s capability to respond to threats and \ncounter-terrorism operations. The U.S. Embassy Baghdad maintains the Office of \nSecurity Cooperation \u2013 Iraq to further these goals and to facilitate Iraq\u2019s role as a \nresponsible security partner, contributing to the peace and security of the region. \n(Admin Not ll)   \n \n \nIraq is a constitutional parliamentary republic. The outcome of the 2014 \nparliamentary elections generally met international standards of free and fair elections \nand led to the peaceful transition of power from former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to \nPrime Minister Haider al-Abadi. (Admin Not 1) \n \n \nThe U.S. Department of State warns that travel within Iraq remains very \ndangerous and the ability of the U.S. Embassy to assist U.S. citizens is extremely \nlimited. U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk for kidnapping and terrorist violence. \nNumerous terrorist and insurgent groups are active in Iraq, including ISIS. Such groups \nregularly attack Iraqi security forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias may also \nthreaten U.S. citizens and western companies throughout Iraq. (Admin Not 1)  \n \n \n \nSevere human rights problems are widespread in Iraq. Sectarian hostility, \nwidespread corruption, and lack of transparency at all levels of government and society \nweakened the government\u2019s authority and worsened effective human rights protections. \nProblems include harsh and life-threatening conditions in detention and prison facilities; \narbitrary arrests and lengthy pretrial detention; limits on freedom of expression to \ninclude press, social, religious and political restrictions in academic and cultural matters; \ndiscrimination against and societal abuse of women and ethnic, religious, and racial \n\n3 \n \nminorities; seizure of property without due process and limitations of worker rights. \n(Admin Not 1)  \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is an 83-year-old linguist employed by a Department of Defense \ncontractor since May 2016. He is currently stationed overseas. He is applying for a \nsecurity clearance. He was born, raised, and educated in Iraq. He also attended college \nand received a bachelor\u2019s degree from a prestigious British University. He has several \ndegrees from Iraqi universities.  Applicant served in the Iraqi military attaining the rank \nof major general. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) He retired in 1984. He is widowed. He and his wife had \nfive children. Two of his sons have passed away. (Tr. 26, 31; Gov 1 \u2013 3, 5) (Note: The \nfacts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of witnesses, or \nlocations in order to protect Applicant and his family\u2019s privacy. The cited sources contain \nmore specific information.)  \n  \nForeign Influence \n \nApplicant served in the Iraqi Army from September 1955 to February 1984.  He \nattended night school and received a law degree in 1976. After he retired, he practiced \nlaw for eight years. He also studied English and was awarded a Bachelor of Arts in \nEnglish in 2004. When the U.S.-led coalition forces invaded Iraq in 2003, Applicant \nworked as a linguist and cultural advisor. He worked with British Forces for one year \nand then with the U.S. military in the Green Zone for four years. Because of the risky \nand dangerous work he was performing for the U.S. military and the risks to his family, \nApplicant was granted a Special Immigrant Visa and immigrated to the United States on \nSeptember 21, 2007. He immigrated with his son M. and his family. (Tr. 19, 25, 31-35; \nGov 1; AE D; AE E; Response to SOR)  \n \nIn August 2008, Applicant worked as a DOD contractor in support of U.S. Marine \nCorps in Iraq as a linguist/advisor until October 2011, when the U.S. military withdrew \nfrom Iraq. He returned to the United States. He became a U.S. citizen on January 4, \n2013. Since June 2016, he has worked as a linguist in Jordan. (Tr. 24, 36, 38-40; Gov \n1; AE D; AE F; Response to SOR)  \n \nThe SOR raises security concerns because Applicant has family members who \nare citizens of and reside in Iraq. Specifically, Applicant\u2019s two sons, daughter, son-in-\nlaw, two brothers, brother-in-law, and good friend are citizens of and reside in Iraq.  \nApplicant provided information about his family members and contacts in Iraq during \nprevious counter-intelligence screenings. (Gov 2, 3 and 5)  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b:  Applicant\u2019s son is a senior officer in the Iraqi Army and is a citizen \nand resident in Iraq.  Applicant admits this allegation. His son is at a joint U.S. \u2013 Iraqi \ncommand in Baghdad. He speaks with his son every three or four months. (Tr. 26, 42-\n45; Response to SOR) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c:  Applicant has a son who is a warrant officer in the Iraqi Army and is \na citizen and resident in Iraq. He speaks with his son every three or four months. (Tr. \n26-27, 45-47; Response to SOR) \n\n4 \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: Applicant\u2019s brother was a retired noncommissioned officer in the Iraqi \nArmy.  He passed away on August 15, 2017. (Tr. 27, 48; Response to SOR) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e:  Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law served in the Iraqi Army and is a retired \nwarrant officer. He is a citizen and resident of Iraq. Applicant\u2019s last contact with his \nbrother-in-law was 2004. (Tr. 27, 48; Response to SOR) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g:  Applicant\u2019s daughter and son-in-law are citizens and \nresidents of Iraq. They are retired math teachers. Applicant speaks with them every \nthree or four months. (Tr. 27-28, 50-51: Response to SOR) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h:  Applicant\u2019s brother is a retired survey engineer who is a citizen and \nresident of Iraq. Applicant speaks with his brother about once a year. He last saw him in \n2014 in Iraq at his son\u2019s funeral. (Tr. 28, 51-53; Response to SOR) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i:  Applicant has a friend who retired as a senior officer from the Iraqi \nArmy. He is a citizen and resident of Iraq. Applicant\u2019s last contact with his friend was in \nSeptember 2004. (Tr. 28-54-55; Response to SOR) \n \nApplicant had a son who was a colonel in the Iraqi Army.  In 2014, he was killed \nin action fighting ISIS in Iraq. (Tr. 36-37; AE D; Response to SOR) Applicant last \ntraveled to Iraq in 2014 to attend his son\u2019s funeral. His company currently prohibits his \ntravel to Iraq.  He speaks with his children in Iraq by telephone. He calls them to discuss \ntheir general welfare. He does not discuss his job or security issues with his children. \nHe is not dependent on them financially and they are not dependent on him financially.  \n(Tr. 36-38, 40-53; Response to SOR)   \n \nWhen Applicant is not working overseas, he lives with his son M. and his family \nin the United States. His son and his wife have three children, two of who were born in \nthe United States. His son and his family have adapted to life in the United States. They \nare all U.S. citizens. His son bought a home. Applicant co-signed the mortgage and \nhelps his son with the mortgage payments. Applicant saved $115,000 in a U.S. bank \naccount. Once his contract as a linguist is complete, he intends to return to the United \nStates and live with his son. Applicant has no bank accounts or financial investments in \nIraq or any other overseas country. Applicant does not receive a pension from the Iraqi \ngovernment for his military service. His military pension was terminated when he \nimmigrated to the United States in 2007. He is registered to vote in the United States \nand has a United States passport. He surrendered his Iraqi passport to his facility \nsecurity officer. (Tr. 23, 33-34, 36-40, 40, 56-59; AE O \u2013 AE Q; AE X) \n \nWhole-person Factors  \n \n \nApplicant provided numerous letters attesting to his character, dedication, and \nabilities as a linguist.  A U.S. Army captain who worked with Applicant in 2003, \ndescribed Applicant as \u201c. . . the most reliable and sought after interpreter we have in \ncamp.\u201d (AE A at 3) Colonel G.F., U.S. Marine Corps, worked with Applicant in Iraq in the \nsummer of 2004.  Colonel G.F. states he has worked with interpreters around the world \nand of the many dozens he has observed, Applicant is the best. Applicant also had a \n\n5 \n \ndeep knowledge of the Iraqi government, military affairs, and the administrative process. \nHe also taught him about Iraqi culture.  (AE A at 4) \n \n \nJ.P., Major General, U.S. Army, recommended Applicant for special immigrant \nstatus in September 2006. He notes Applicant served as a translator in support of U.S. \nArmy from June 2004 to 2006.  He states Applicant is a trusted and valuable contributor \nto the Coalition efforts in Iraq. (AE A at 11) \n \n \nIn October 2006, J.P., Lieutenant Colonel, U.S. Army nominated Applicant for an \naward for his exceptional translator/interpreter skills and his willingness to go above and \nbeyond the call of his normal duties. Applicant\u2019s reputation is well known because he \nalways volunteers for the difficult tasks and provides the highest quality translations. \n(AE A at 13) \n \n \nIn June 2009, Lieutenant Colonel M., USMC, wrote a letter of recommendation \nfor Applicant, noting that he worked with Applicant during pre-deployment training in \nsupport of Iraqi Freedom.  Lieutenant Colonel M. notes Applicant \u201chas consistently \ndisplayed courage, dedication, and a patriotic sense of duty.\u201d His support for Coalition \nForces and Iraqi Security Forces was instrumental in developing Joint Coordination \nCenters through Al Anbar Province and had a positive impact in the overall security and \nstability of the province. (AE A at 19) \n \n \nIn July 2010, Lieutenant Colonel T. states \u201cIn 24 years of service as a U.S. Army \nofficer, I have never witnessed such dedication and loyalty as exemplified by \n[Applicant]. He is always at the forefront of his colleagues in work ethic, cultural \nexpertise and language competency, and because of these professional attributes I \nwithout hesitation give him my highest recommendation for both employment and \ncontinued service as a valued friend and strategic asset to the mission.\u201d (AE A at 20) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor describes him as \u201ca tireless worker, always going \nthe extra mile with our Army customer, whom he has impressed over and over. He has \nexcellent communication skills, consistently handling complex situations; advising U.S. \nArmy personnel of best practices regarding our Jordanian military partners; working with \nthe customer to provide unsurpassed mission support. . . .\u201d (AE L at 1) \n \n \nNumerous reference letters say similar favorable things about Applicant. (AE A; \nAE L) He also received several certificates of appreciation and other awards. (AE B) His \nperformance evaluations are highly favorable. He received several bonus payments for \nhis performance in 2018 and 2019. (AE A; AE J)  In October 2018, Applicant completed \na 28-mile March for the Fallen alongside the U.S. troops he supports. His achievement \nwas the focus of an article in the base newspaper and Applicant received an award from \nthe command. (Tr. 20-23; AE K; AE Y)  \n \n \nApplicant testified he enjoys being able to facilitate communications between the \nAmerican and Iraqi communities. He enjoys working with the military because of his \nmilitary background. His allegiance is to the United States. He will do his best to keep \nthe U.S. interests safe and will follow the rules of law. (Tr.  58; Response to SOR) \n \n\n6 \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n \n\n7 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \n   \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the Government\u2019s concern under Foreign Influence:   \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign  country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s case, AG \u00b6 7(a) and AG \u00b6 7(b) apply. The mere possession of \nclose family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, \ndisqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country \nand an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create \nthe potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of \nclassified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); \nISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). Applicant has several family members \nwho are citizens and reside in Iraq to include two sons, one daughter, a brother-in-law, \nand a son-in-law. This creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion because of Iraq\u2019s serious human rights problems, \nand its issues with terrorism. The government of Iraq has made some progress, but a \nheightened risk remains. Applicant\u2019s family in Iraq also create a potential conflict of \ninterest between his obligation to protect classified information and his desire to help his \nfamily members by providing that information. The risk is heightened further because \ntwo of Applicant\u2019s sons are members of the Iraqi Army, one of whom is a senior officer.  \n\n8 \n \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of disqualifying conditions AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b). The burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a \nmitigating condition. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment.  \n  \nAG \u00b6 8 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nmitigating condition applies: \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest.  \n \n \nWhile Applicant\u2019s family members who are citizens of and reside in Iraq raise \nsecurity concerns, those concerns are mitigated because of Applicant\u2019s lengthy and \ndistinguished service as a linguist supporting the U.S. military in Iraq and Jordan. At \ngreat risk to himself, Applicant worked for the British and U.S. Government in Iraq from \n2003 to 2007 while he was an Iraqi citizen.  His efforts resulted in the U.S. Government \ngranting Applicant a Special Immigrant Visa (SIV). Applicant immigrated to the United \nStates in 2007. He settled in the United States with his son\u2019s family, but accepted \nanother linguist job supporting U.S. Marines in Iraq from August 2008 to 2011.  He \nbecame a U.S. citizen in January 2014.  In 2016, Applicant accepted a linguist position \nfor the U.S military in Jordan. In ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, \n2006), the Appeal Board discussed this issue as follows: \n \nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s prior \nhistory of complying with security procedures and regulations significant \nprobative value for the purposes of refuting, mitigating, or extenuating the \nsecurity concerns raised by that applicant\u2019s more immediate disqualifying \nconduct or circumstances. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-03357 at 4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-10113 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, \n2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 30, 2006). \nHowever, the Board has recognized an exception to that general rule in \nGuideline B cases, where the applicant has established by credible, \nindependent evidence that his compliance with security procedures and \nregulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances \nin which the applicant had made a significant contribution to the national \nsecurity. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. July 14, \n2006). The presence of such circumstances can give credibility to an \napplicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to recognize, resist, and \nreport a foreign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or exploitation.  \nI considered Applicant\u2019s longstanding commitment to the United States as well as \nhis favorable contributions to national security. He worked under dangerous conditions \nas a linguist for the U.S. Government. Numerous British and U.S. military members \nattest to his dedication and work ethic. His efforts resulted in him being granted a SIV. \n\n9 \n \nHe immigrated to the United States and became a U.S. citizen. Applicant is proud of his \nU.S. citizenship. I find that Applicant can be expected to resolve any potential conflict of \ninterest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(b) is applicable. The security concerns \nunder Foreign Influence are mitigated.  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s devotion to \nthe U.S. government\u2019s mission in Iraq and Jordan. I considered the numerous letters of \nsupport from British and U.S. military colleagues with whom Applicant worked as a \nlinguist. I considered his support of the U.S. government overseas both before and after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen. Applicant is devoted to his new country the U.S. and intends to \npermanently reside with his son and his family who reside in the U.S.  \n \nForeign Influence concerns were raised because of Applicant\u2019s service in the \nIraqi military, his family members who are citizens and reside in Iraq as well as his sons\u2019 \nservice in the Iraqi military. Applicant lost a son who was killed in action fighting ISIS in \n2014.  He has suffered a great loss, but remains dedicated to the U.S. mission \noverseas. Applicant mitigated these concerns based on his dedication and outstanding \nservice as a linguist to the U.S. military mission in Iraq and Jordan since 2003.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.i: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n\n10 \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the U.S. to grant Applicant \neligibility for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n_________________ \nERIN C. HOGAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nKILMARTIN, Robert J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n     Statement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on April 19, 2016. On  \nNovember 21, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations. An amended SOR, dated December 28, \n2017, was also issued under Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AGs) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 6, 2017, admitting all of the SOR \nallegations with explanations. Applicant answered the amended SOR on January 19, \n2018, denying the allegation at SOR \u00b6 1.d and admitting the allegation at SOR \u00b6 1.e. He \nattached several documents to this answer including: copies of seven checks each in \n01/17/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nthe amount of $200 made out to the homeowner\u2019s association creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.d; a \npayment agreement with a state A department of revenue; a November 8, 2017, letter \nfrom a well-known financial counseling company with a 14-page-action plan.                      \nApplicant also requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was \nassigned to me on October 16, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for December 5, 2018. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled.  \n \nThe Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 9 were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. At the hearing, Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough I, which were admitted without objection. The transcript (Tr.) was received at \nDOHA on January 2, 2019.  \n \n  Findings of Fact1 \n \nApplicant is 41 years old. He was married in 2003 and separated in 2014. His \ndivorce became final in June 2017. (Tr. 73) Applicant and his ex-wife raised five \nchildren. The oldest three are adults, in the service or college. Applicant and his ex-wife \nshare custody of the youngest two boys, ages 12 and 14. He obtained a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in 2010, and reports no military service. (Tr. 53-54) Applicant has been \nemployed by a federal contractor as a consultant since November 2011. Applicant\u2019s ex-\nwife did not work outside the home.  \n \n The SOR alleged a debt to the federal government for past-due [sales] taxes in \nthe amount of $115,861 (SOR \u00b61.a) and a debt to state A for past-due-income taxes in \nthe amount of $10,486 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). It also alleged a charged-off debt for a credit card \nin the amount of $62,147 (SOR \u00b61.c). Applicant admitted all of the allegations in his \nAnswer to the SOR. Applicant testified credibly that he initially had tax problems when \nhe changed status from a W-2 to a 1099 employee in 2009-2010. (Tr. 58-60) He didn\u2019t \nunderstand that he was supposed to estimate and pay quarterly taxes. He had a \ncertified public accountant (CPA) prepare and file returns at the end of each tax year \n(TY). However, he could not afford to pay the taxes due. So, he entered into a payment \nplan and has paid all income taxes owed for TY 2009-2010, which are not alleged in the \nSOR.  \n \nApplicant was working full time as a federal contractor in 2013. He decided to \nstart a retail store to supplement his income. (Tr. 79) He provided the lease for Chatman \nSolutions, LLC, which required that he make payments of $5,500 over five years \nstarting on November 1, 2013. (AE B) This was his first venture into retail. Almost \nimmediately, a large Walmart store opened up across the street from his store, \nsiphoning off business. (Tr. 58) Applicant struggled and didn\u2019t even break even on the \nstore. (Tr. 53-54) He slept on a couch in the back of the store as he separated from his \nwife in 2014. His ex-wife did not work, he had children in college, his store was failing, \n                                                          \n1 Unless stated otherwise, the source of the information in this section is Applicant\u2019s April 19, 2016, \nsecurity clearance application (SCA). \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nand now he was headed for a divorce proceeding. (Tr. 53) Applicant admitted he did not \npay the required quarterly taxes on his LLC for TY 2012 to TY 2016.   \n \nApplicant submitted answers to interrogatories on November 13, 2017, verifying \nan attached summary of his personal subject interview (PSI) conducted on June 12, \n2017. (GE 2) He attached a packet of documents including: payment coupons to state A \nfor delinquent sales tax as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. These confirmed his testimony that the \nstate-tax lien is in a repayment plan; (Tr. 97) IRS tax transcripts reflecting a total \nbalance of overdue federal taxes owed by the Chatman Solutions, LLC, for TY 2012 \u2013 \n2016, of $115,047 as of October 2017; a payment plan for overdue income-taxes owed \nto state A in the amount of $10,486 with several tax lien expungements; and a portion of \na divorce decree showing that [Applicant] husband was responsible for working out a \npayment plan with the IRS, and state A, for all tax debts. GE 8 reflects a series of \nintermittent payments of approximately $458 made between May 2014 and July 2017 to \nsatisfy the state tax liens. Applicant provided a sheaf of documents showing a \ncontinuous stream of $200 payments to state A department of revenue from July 2012 \nto November 2018. (AE F) The remaining balance owed to State A is $16,911.  \n \n Applicant testified and provided documents showing that he opened a credit \ncard account in late 2012 to pay expenses for his retail store. (Tr. 81) He put in \napproximately $60,000 to $70,000 but the store always lost money. (Tr. 88) The credit \ncard went into default in early 2014. (Tr. 88) GE 6 shows a judgment entered against \nApplicant in a county court in the amount of $68,772 owed to this creditor. Applicant \nentered a repayment agreement and demonstrated a series of $100 dollar check \npayments to the creditor or its collection agency from April 2016 to November 2018. (AE \nG)  \n \nApplicant testified and produced documentation showing that the lien entered \nagainst him in the amount of $1,400 by a homeowner\u2019s association (HOA) as alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.d has been paid in full. (Tr. 96) This was owed for a vacant parcel of land for \nwhich Applicant has a mortgage loan, and he agreed to keep making the payments \npursuant to the divorce decree.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s IRS tax transcripts and W-2\u2019s were attached to his answers to \ninterrogatories. (GE 2) They reveal his adjusted gross income (AGI) of $247,000 in TY \n2012; $158,000 in TY 2013; $143,000 in TY 2014; $160,000 in TY 2015; and $124,000 \nin TY 2016. He testified that he filed federal and state income tax returns timely each \nyear, but he could not afford to pay the taxes owed due to his alimony and child support \npayments, failing store, and divorce. (Tr. 66, 139) He admits to also making some bad \ndecisions about money. (Tr. 120) He contemplated filing for bankruptcy protection, but \nconsidered that to be a cop out, and avoided it. (Tr. 145)  \n \nApplicant testified about an earlier installment payment plan that he had with the \nIRS in 2013 for overdue taxes from TY 2011. He detrimentally relied on a CPA who led \nApplicant to believe this was in a non-collectible status. (Tr. 126-128) His repayment \nagreement with the IRS fell apart after 18 months when Applicant encountered financial \n\n \n4 \n \n \ndistress with his retail store, and became separated in 2014. (Tr. 122) On March 21, \n2018, Applicant entered into an Offer in Compromise with the IRS after providing all of \nhis financial information to the IRS. (Tr. 106) The IRS used a formula to set the amount \nof the payment due and he settled for $8,000, conditional upon his timely filing and \npaying all taxes due for five years. (AE E, Tr. 113-117) An October 7, 2018, letter from \nthe IRS to Applicant accepted his offer in compromise and included a copy of a check to \nIRS from Applicant for $6,575. This was the balance owed for TY 2012, according to \nIRS tax transcripts. (AE E) The tax transcripts reflect a zero balance owed for TYs 2013, \n2014, 2015, and a $15,185 balance for TY 2016. (AE E) Applicant testified credibly that \nall of his overdue federal taxes have now been paid off. (Tr. 117-118) \n \nApplicant provided evidence of financial counseling from his aunts and a well-\nknown company with an action plan to formulate a budget and payment plan. (AE D, Tr. \n145) He also provided 16 character reference letters, all attesting to his positive attitude, \nintegrity, work ethic, trustworthiness and reliability. (AE A) Applicant had his pastor \ntestify on his behalf at the hearing. (Tr. 37-42) He testified that Applicant is a family man \nand actively involved in his church and he was even elected recently to the vestry or \nleadership. Applicant volunteers his time in the community and he is well respected, \ntrustworthy, and reliable. The pastor has no reservations about Applicant holding a \nsecurity clearance.  \n \n \n \n                                        Policies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG, \nAppendix A, \u00b6 2(a), the adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period and \na careful weighing of a number of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative \ndetermination that the individual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG, \nAppendix A, \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \nnational security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching \nthis decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and \nbased on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential risk of compromise of classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Analysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b618:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance abuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable here:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n           (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n           (f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state or local income tax as  \nrequired.   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s past-due taxes and delinquent debts alleged in the SOR are \nconfirmed by his credit reports, answer to the SOR, and documents submitted at the \nhearing. The Government produced substantial evidence to support the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a),19(c) and 19(f), thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to \nproduce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.2  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control . . . , and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances;    \n \n(c) the individual has received, or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant endured a series of setbacks including a downturn in the economy, an \nexpensive divorce, and a bad business investment. His ex-wife did not work and they \nhad five children. He pays alimony and child support. These conditions were beyond his \ncontrol. He has done everything possible to pay off delinquent debts and enter into \nrepayment plans for his past-due taxes. He documented strict compliance with these \nrepayment plans through a stream of continuous payments to the state taxing authority \nand satisfaction of his past-due federal tax debt. He has now produced relevant and \nresponsive documentation, demonstrating that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Applicant appropriately engaged a CPA to address his financial \nproblems with his retail store. He also had independent financial counseling. All of his \ndebts and past-due taxes alleged in the SOR, have been paid in full or they are in \nrepayment plans. He has met his burden to show that his financial problems are under \n                                                          \n2 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep 22, 2005) (An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government). \n\n \n7 \n \n \ncontrol, and that his debts were incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to \nrecur. The mitigating conditions enumerated above in AG \u00b6 20 apply.  \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG, Appendix A, \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG, Appendix A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG, Appendix A, \n\u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline. Applicant is ambitious, hard-working, and \nextremely well respected in his church and community. He helped in raising five \nchildren. He has been gainfully employed for most of his adult life, often working two \njobs. He recognizes and accepts that he made a bad business decision with the retail \nstore. He has struggled to overcome his financial travails and pay off his past-due taxes. \nHe was organized and well prepared for his hearing and demonstrated a continuous \nstream of payments to the state A taxing authority, and satisfaction of the IRS tax debt. \nApplicant testified credibly and persuasively that his finances are now under control. \nApplicant has addressed the specific allegations in the SOR and taken affirmative \nmeasures to resolve them.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances no longer are a security concern. The record evidence \nleaves me with no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.e:              For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n                                                 Robert J.

She also operates a part-time business since 2014, and teaches college classes since 2009. She earned two associate\u2019s degrees in 2011 and 2016. She married in 2000 and has four children. She has never held a security clearance. The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in March 2017. Applicant admitted the allegation, and provided a statement explaining the circumstances for the bankruptcy. Applicant had medical problems from a high-risk pregnancy in 2012, resulting in medical debts, mandated bed rest, and a loss of her full-time employment. Even though her husband continued to work full time, the loss of her income had a substantial impact on the family budget. She applied for government assistance, but was denied. She resorted to using a loan and credit cards to meet monthly expenses until the child was born and she could return to work. She returned to work part time but they were unable to meet their debt obligations incurred while she was unemployed. Applicant completed a financial management course and filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in March 2017. In December 2017, the court ordered a discharge of about $48,000 in debts. Applicant retained her student loans and has been paying on time with no delinquencies. Applicant and her husband are currently working, and have a net monthly remainder of $200 to $300 per month, ",

Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective on June 8, \n2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on April 17, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of \nhearing on June 12, 2018, scheduling a hearing for July 11, 2018. After communication \n\n \n2 \n \nwith Applicant, the hearing was rescheduled and held on June 5, 2019. Government\u2019s \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old medical service provider for a government contractor, \nemployed since December 2016. She also operates a part-time business since 2014, and \nteaches college classes since 2009. She earned two associate\u2019s degrees in 2011 and \n2016. She married in 2000 and has four children. She has never held a security clearance. \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in \nMarch 2017. Applicant admitted the allegation, and provided a statement explaining the \ncircumstances for the bankruptcy. \n \n \nApplicant had medical problems from a high-risk pregnancy in 2012, resulting in \nmedical debts, mandated bed rest, and a loss of her full-time employment. Even though \nher husband continued to work full time, the loss of her income had a substantial impact \non the family budget. She applied for government assistance, but was denied. She \nresorted to using a loan and credit cards to meet monthly expenses until the child was \nborn and she could return to work. She returned to work part time but they were unable \nto meet their debt obligations incurred while she was unemployed. Applicant completed \na financial management course and filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in March 2017. In \nDecember 2017, the court ordered a discharge of about $48,000 in debts. Applicant \nretained her student loans and has been paying on time with no delinquencies. \n \n \nApplicant and her husband are currently working, and have a net monthly \nremainder of $200 to $300 per month, and savings of about $2,000. They are current with \nall of their financial obligations and maintain a budget. They financially assist her \ngrandparents on occasion because they help with childcare, and she returns profits back \ninto her business. Applicant completed a more comprehensive financial counseling \ncourse at her local college before she completed the bankruptcy court required \ncounseling.  \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \n\n \n3 \n \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG para. 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG para. 1(d). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG para. 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG para. 19 include: (a) inability to \nsatisfy debts. Applicant\u2019s admission and the documentary evidence supporting the SOR \nallegation are sufficient to establish the above disqualifying condition. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG para. 20 are potentially relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems occurred after a high-risk pregnancy resulting in her \nloss of her job and a significantly reduced family income.  Applicant had to borrow to meet \nfinancial obligations while she was on bed rest, and fell behind on debts until her child \nwas born and she could return to work. She resorted to Chapter 7 bankruptcy, fulfilled all \nof the court\u2019s requirements, and successfully discharged her debts. Since 2017, she and \n\n \n5 \n \nher husband are working, they have sufficient income to meet all of their financial \nobligations, and there has been no recurrence of financial distress or unpaid debts. \n \n \nApplicant is now on solid financial footing. Her family income from her three jobs \nand her husband\u2019s income are more than sufficient for her to meet all of their financial \nresponsibilities. Appellant has shown a track record of responsible financial decisions and \nthere is sufficient evidence to determine that she is living within her means. I find that \nApplicant acted responsibly under the circumstances to address her debts with the only \nmeans at her disposal given her difficult financial condition. Her financial condition no \nlonger casts doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \nparas. 20(a), (b), and (c) apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG paras. 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG para. 2(d). Although adverse information concerning a single criterion \nmay not be sufficient for an unfavorable eligibility determination, the individual may be \nfound ineligible if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of \nquestionable judgment, irresponsibility, or unstable behavior. AG para. 2(e). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of \nfact and comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant has \nundergone significant financial stress through no fault of her own, but acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. She allocated resources within her means to address debts as \nshe could. I am convinced that a similar financial event is unlikely to recur and that \nApplicant is financially stable. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions \nor doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance \neligibility is granted. \n \n \n_______________________ \nGregg A. Cervi \nAdministrative Judge \n",

National \nsecurity eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \nHistory of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on August 31, 2015. \nOn December 12, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 19, 2018, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. The Government was ready to proceed on November 26, 2018, and \nthe case was assigned to me on December 4, 2018. On December 13, 2018, I issued an \norder to both parties to produce their evidence by December 26, 2018, and the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled \nfor January 8, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled.  \n \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3 were admitted, without objection. \nApplicant testified and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through D were admitted, without \nobjection. I received the completed transcript (TR) on January 16, 2019. I held the record \nopen until February 4, 2019, to allow Applicant to submit additional documentation. He \ntimely submitted AE E through AE J, which I admitted without objection.  \n\n \n2 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 45 years old. He attended some college courses and is just short of \nan associate\u2019s degree. Applicant was married to his first wife from 2008 until they divorced \nin 2012. He married his second wife in May 2014, and they separated in July 2015, and \ndivorced in January 2016. Applicant has worked for his current employer as an electrical \ninstaller since late 2016. (GE 1; Tr. 20-21, 34) \n \nDuring his first marriage, Applicant paid the family mortgage and financially \nsupported members of his wife\u2019s family. He used credit cards to supplement their income \nand cover household expenses. When they divorced in 2012, he was required to assume \nresponsibility for all of the marital debts, including the debts alleged in the SOR, and his \nwife was awarded their house. After the divorce, Applicant was unable to continue to \nmake the minimum monthly payments, in part, because he was laid off from his job in \nearly 2013. He also financially supported his second wife throughout their marriage. When \nApplicant started working for his current employer, in late 2016, his salary nearly doubled. \n(Tr. 20-23, 27, 33, 37) \n \n \nApplicant opened the credit card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. in 1996 and made \npayments until approximately 2013. The debt was charged off by the creditor in March \n2014. In December 2017, Applicant was issued a 1099-C for cancellation of debt, which \nrequired him to pay $6,500 in state and federal income taxes on the discharged debt. \nApplicant made payments toward these debts in 2018, and resolved the outstanding state \nand federal income tax liabilities in early 2019. (GE 2 at 4; GE 3 at 2; AE A; AE D; AE H; \nAE I; AE J; Tr. 17, 19-20, 22, 25, 30, 36) \n \n \nApplicant opened the credit card account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. in 2006 and made \npayments until approximately 2012 or 2013. He attempted to make settlement \narrangements with the creditor several times, but experienced difficulty communicating \nwith the creditor. In January 2019, Applicant signed an agreement to settle the debt for \njust under $8,000 and made a $500 payment. (GE 2 at 4; GE 3 at 2; AE A; AE G; AE J; \nTr. 22-24, 29-30) \n \nApplicant\u2019s current finances are in good standing, and he has no new delinquent \ndebts. He provided documentation that he has resolved and paid debts that were not \nalleged in the SOR. Finally, he attended credit counseling and follows a written budget. \n(AE A; AE B; AE C; AE E; AE F; AE J; Tr. 15-16, 31-35, 38, 49)  \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n\n \n4 \n \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.1  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence establish two disqualifying \nconditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant experienced personal financial issues related to his two divorces and a \nperiod of unemployment. In late 2017, he learned that he had a tax debt related to the \ncancellation of one of his marital credit cards. Throughout 2018, he made payments \n                                                          \n1 ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n\n \n5 \n \ntoward this debt and resolved it in early 2019. He signed a settlement agreement for his \nremaining unresolved debt and has made a substantial payment. His actions demonstrate \na good-faith effort to resolve his debts. \n \nApplicant follows a written budget and sought credit counseling. Applicant pays all \nof his current financial obligations and has no new delinquent debts. He is willing and able \nto live within his means, which is reflected in the testimonial and documentary evidence. \nMitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) was established.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. \n \nI conclude Applicant met his burden of proof and persuasion. He mitigated the \nfinancial considerations security concerns and established his eligibility for a security \nclearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.b:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security of the \nUnited States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nCAROLINE E. HEINTZELMAN \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

As of July \n2019, the balance totaled approximately $750. (AE A at 3) Since August 2018, Applicant \nhas been repaying this delinquency through $46 monthly payments. (AE A at 3) Per the \nstate comptroller, Applicant\u2019s payment plan is currently in good standing. (AE A at 3) \n \n \nSOR subparagraph 1.c alleges a loan delinquent in the amount of $11,359. \nApplicant denies this debt. (Answer at 2; GE 5 at 3) She contacted each of the credit \nreporting bureaus to dispute this debt. Subsequently, each of the credit reporting agencies \nremoved the debt from the respective credit reports. \n\n3 \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d is a delinquent utility bill totaling $1,959. Applicant paid this debt \nin March 2018. (AE C) \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e is a delinquent credit card totaling $631. By October 2018, \nApplicant had paid this account in full.

(AE D) \n \n \nApplicant earns $86,000 per year. She supplements her salary by driving an Uber, \ngenerating an additional $6,000 annually. (Tr. 73) She has $1,800 of monthly discretionary \nincome (Tr. 18) She has $800 in savings and $7,000 invested in a 401k account. (Tr. 74) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n\n4 \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are set forth in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet  \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies and her failure to file her 2015 and 2016 federal \nand state income taxes on time trigger the application of the following disqualifying \nconditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax, as \nrequired. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems stemmed from a 16-month period of unemployment \nafter she lost her job in December 2011. Over the past 18 months, she has gradually been \nsatisfying her debt. Currently, she has satisfied all of her delinquent commercial debt, \nexcept the one alleged in subparagraph 1.c, which she disputed, and had removed from \nher credit reports. She has filed her delinquent state and federal income tax returns and \nhas been steadily paying the outstanding balances through payment plans.  \n \n \nApplicant has ample discretionary income to make ends meet. She has bolstered \nher financial stability by obtaining a part-time job. Under these circumstances, the following \nmitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 apply: \n\n5 \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c)  . . . there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n. \nI conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors under AG \u00b6 2(d), as set forth below:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nUpon considering the circumstances surrounding the incurrence of the debt, \nApplicant\u2019s satisfaction of all of the commercial debt, and the progress toward satisfying \nher income tax delinquency, I conclude that Applicant has rehabilitated her finances, \nmaking the possibility of recurrence of her financial problems unlikely.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.h:  \n \nFor Applicant \n\n6 \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n_____________________ \nMarc E. Curry \n Administrative Judge \n",

My findings of fact are as follows: Applicant is a 24-year-old high school graduate, who completed certificate programs to be a nurse\u2019s aide in late 2013 and an automotive technician in July 2016.

Gregorian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant was arrested in March 2012, March 2014, and June 2014 for felony drug \nsales; in December 2012 for operating under the influence (OUI); and in July 2013 for \nassault, disorderly conduct, and risk of injury to a child. In March 2015, he was placed on \nprobation to September 2016 for the OUI and to March 2018 for the 2012 sale of a \ncontrolled substance. More time is needed to demonstrate reform of the criminal conduct \nand personal conduct concerns. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 20, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline J (criminal conduct), Guideline H (drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse), Guideline G (alcohol consumption), and Guideline E (personal \nconduct). The SOR explained why the DOD CAF was unable to find it clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him. The DOD \nCAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \n08/10/2018\n\n2 \n \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) \neffective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on November 24, 2017, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \nOn February 9, 2018, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine \nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. On February 26, 2018, I scheduled a hearing for March 20, 2018. \n \nAt the hearing, four Government exhibits (GEs 1-4) were admitted in evidence. A \nDecember 14, 2017 letter forwarding the proposed GEs to Applicant and a list of the GEs \nwere marked as hearing exhibits (HEs I-II) for the record but not admitted in evidence. On \nthe Government\u2019s motion and without objection from Applicant, the Guideline G allegation \nwas withdrawn. Three Applicant exhibits (AEs A-C) were admitted in evidence. Applicant \ntestified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on March 28, 2018. \n \nI held the record open for three weeks after the hearing for additional documents \nfrom Applicant. No documents were received by the deadline and so the record closed on \nApril 10, 2018. \n \nSummary of SOR Allegations \n \n \nThe SOR, as amended, alleges under Guideline J and cross-alleges under \nGuideline E (SOR 4.a), that Applicant was arrested for possession of marijuana with intent \nto sell in approximately March 2012 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), March 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.d), and June 2014 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e); for driving under the influence in approximately December 2012 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); \nand for assault in approximately July 2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and that in return for Applicant\u2019s \nguilty pleas in March 2015 to felony sale of a controlled substance and OUI, all other \ncharges were dropped (SOR \u00b6 1.f). The drug charges are cross-alleged under Guideline H \n(SOR \u00b6 2.a). Applicant is also alleged under Guideline H (SOR \u00b6 2.b), and cross-alleged \nunder Guideline E (SOR \u00b6 4.b), to have used marijuana with varying frequency from \napproximately June 2010 to June 2014. Moreover, under Guideline E, Applicant is alleged \nto have been terminated for cause from at least two jobs since 2012 (SOR \u00b6 4.c). When \nApplicant responded to the SOR, he admitted the allegations without explanation. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I find that SOR \u00b6 1.f does \nnot allege additional conduct of security concern, but rather reflects the disposition for the \noffenses covered in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e. My findings of fact are as follows: \n \nApplicant is a 24-year-old high school graduate, who completed certificate programs \nto be a nurse\u2019s aide in late 2013 and an automotive technician in July 2016. He is not \nmarried but is in a cohabitant relationship with his fianc\u00e9e. They have a two-year-old \n\n3 \n \ndaughter. (GEs 1-2; AE A; Tr. 20, 26-27, 32.) Applicant is employed in automobile sales, \nbut he has an offer of defense-contractor employment contingent on him obtaining a \nsecurity clearance. (Tr. 27-28.) \n \nApplicant began using mood-altering substances as a teenager. He was influenced \nby friends in his environment and used marijuana on a daily basis with two friends from \nJune 2010 to June 2014. He purchased the drug from those friends, and he sold marijuana \nto his friends. The date when he started drinking alcohol is not in the record, although he \nvolunteered that he drank alcohol in quantity of five drinks or more to intoxication until early \n2015, when he then moderated his consumption. (GE 4; Tr. 30, 70.) \n \nApplicant also began committing crimes as a teenager. At age 15 in July 2009, \nApplicant broke into some vehicles with a friend and stole loose change and a GPS unit. \nHe was charged with felony burglary and placed on two years of probation. In \napproximately July 2011, Applicant was loitering at a local baseball field with three friends \nwhen the police arrived. Intoxicated from drinking at a party earlier that night, Applicant ran \ninto a pharmacy and stole five packs of cigarettes. He was given accelerated rehabilitation \nfor the theft. (GEs 1, 4.) \n \nThe month following his high school graduation, Applicant started the nurse\u2019s aide \nprogram at a local community college in July 2011. That September, he began working a \npart-time retail job. (GEs 1, 4.) \n \nOn March 20, 2012, Applicant was arrested for sale of a controlled substance, a \nfelony.1 He was a passenger in a vehicle with some friends when they were pulled over by \nthe state police for a brake light issue. The police smelled marijuana because Applicant \nand his friends had been smoking the drug in the backseat, and Applicant had multiple \nbags of marijuana in his jacket. (GEs 1, 3-4; Tr. 52-53.) Applicant completed court-ordered \ntreatment for his marijuana use from September 2012 to November 2012. (GE 1; Tr. 37.) \n \n                                                 \n1 During his subject interview, Applicant recalled the offense as occurring in May 2012, and that he was at a \ncarnival with three bags of marijuana to sell and to smoke. He indicates that an unknown individual walked up \nto him and gave him a cell phone for the marijuana. Applicant was then arrested in a vehicle in the parking lot. \n(GE 4.) An FBI record shows that he was arrested in March 2012 for sale of a controlled substance. (GE 3.) \nThe statute Applicant violated, Section 21a-277(b) provides in part: \n \n(b) Any person who manufactures, distributes, sells, prescribes, dispenses, compounds, \ntransports with intent to sell or dispense, possesses with intent to sell or dispense, offers, \ngives or administers to another person any controlled substance, except a narcotic \nsubstance, or a hallucinogenic substance other than marijuana, except as authorized in this \nchapter, may, for the first offense, be fined not more than twenty-five thousand dollars or be \nimprisoned not more than seven years or be both fined and imprisoned; and, for each \nsubsequent offense, may be fined not more than one hundred thousand dollars or be \nimprisoned not more than fifteen years, or be both fined and imprisoned. \n \nThe FBI record does not indicate that he was arrested for possession with intent to sell as alleged in the SOR, \nalthough intent to sell would violate the same statute. \n\n4 \n \nApplicant sold marijuana with some regularity, including at times once or twice a \nweek, from 2012 to September 2014. He sold the drug usually to friends and \u201chere and \nthere\u201d to friends of his friends. His profit from the marijuana sales was usually enough for \nhim to purchase more for his personal consumption. (Tr. 35-37, 45.) \n \nOn April 7, 2012, Applicant was stopped for OUI and reckless driving, although \nformal charges were not filed against him until December 2012. Applicant had consumed \nalcohol at a party when his companion suggested that he drive because he appeared to be \nmore sober. He drove her to another party, where Applicant became \u201ctotally drunk.\u201d He \nthen drove three friends to a store, but on returning to the party with his friends, he \n\u201cblacked out\u201d and crashed his vehicle into a house. Applicant was unconscious, and broke \nhis neck and back in the accident. (GEs 1, 3-4; Tr. 56-61.) He was ordered into alcohol \ncounseling following his arrest in December 2012, which he completed. (Tr. 38-39.) \n  \n \nApplicant was terminated from his part-time retail job in July 2012 after he failed to \nreport for work. He failed to keep track of his work schedule and was often tardy. Applicant \nalso speculates that his co-workers may have told his supervisor that he smelled of \nmarijuana. He had rolled a \u201cblunt\u201d in the bathroom the day before his termination, although \nhe claims it was for future use. (GEs 1, 4; Tr. 43-44.) \n \n \nApplicant was unemployed from July 2012 to June 2013. He supported himself by \nselling marijuana. He also spent his time partying. (GEs 1, 4; Tr. 44.) On June 17, 2013, \nApplicant was sitting on his porch when a minor age 15 or 16 spat at him. It escalated into \na physical altercation. A few weeks later, the police charged Applicant with risk of injury, a \nfelony, and with assault, 3rd degree, and disorderly conduct, both misdemeanors. (GEs 1, \n3-4; Tr. 62-64.) Applicant now asserts that he \u201cjust basically restrained\u201d the minor by \nputting him in a headlock to calm him down.2 He denies that he injured the youth in any \nway and attributes his arrest to the youth\u2019s brother, who disliked Applicant. (Tr. 64.)  \n \nApplicant worked as a part-time cashier at a doughnut shop from June 2013 to \nAugust 2013. He was late for work several times because he was out too late partying and \ndid not report for his 5:00 a.m. shift. He was issued written warnings three or four times \nbefore being fired for tardiness. Applicant was unemployed for the next year. He supported \nhimself by selling marijuana. (GEs 1, 4; Tr. 45.) \n \n \nOn March 1, 2014, Applicant was arrested for felony sale of a controlled substance \nand for misdemeanor possession of marijuana. Applicant was stopped by the police in \n                                                 \n2 Applicant testified about the July 2013 assault of a minor, as follows: \n \nThey said that [the minor] was bleeding. And they said that he was hurt. But the only thing I \ndid to him was I put him in a headlock and I had to calm him down. He kept trying to swing at \nme. But I already knew that he was young and underage. So I just basically restrained him. \nAnd even after the fact that he spit on me even after everything got broken up and all that \nstuff. (Tr. 64.) \n \n\n5 \n \nroute to a party after he threw something from his vehicle. He had three bags of marijuana \non him to sell at a party, and he smelled of marijuana.3 (GEs 1, 3-4; Tr. 65-66.) \n \n \nOn June 26, 2014, Applicant was arrested for felony possession of marijuana, felony \nsale of a controlled substance, felony conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to sell, \nand felony conspiracy to sell a controlled substance. A friend contacted him about \npurchasing some marijuana from him in a local parking lot. When Applicant arrived, the \npolice arrested him for selling marijuana for financial profit. He had four ounces of \nmarijuana in his possession. (GEs 1, 3-4; Tr. 66-67.) Applicant asserts that he ceased his \nmarijuana use in June 2014 because it made him feel \u201cdemotivated.\u201d (GE 4.) He continued \nto sell marijuana until September 2014 to pay for his lawyer. He possessed some \nmarijuana after his arrest and he \u201cwasn\u2019t going to give it away.\u201d (Tr. 45-46.) \n \n \nWith the aforesaid criminal charges still pending against him for offenses committed \nsince March 2012, Applicant began working part time as a cashier at a sporting goods \nstore in September 2014. He was terminated in November 2014 after he was caught \nstealing. He is ineligible for rehire. Applicant attempted to steal some food from the store \nbecause he did not have enough money to pay for lunch. He was making \u201cwrong decision \nafter wrong decision.\u201d (GEs 1, 3-4; Tr. 46-47.) Applicant lived at home with his mother, and \nshe supported him financially when he was unemployed from November 2014 to January \n2015. (GE 4.) \n \n \nIn January 2015, Applicant began working as a part-time cook at a pizza restaurant. \nHe left the job in March 2016. (GE 1; Tr. 46.) According to the employer, he is not eligible \nfor rehire because he was slow and did not follow instructions. Applicant held a second \npart-time job at a fast-food establishment from February 2015 to February or March 2016, \nwhen he resigned to spend time with his child and focus on his training to become an \nautomotive technician, which he had started in July 2015. (GEs 1, 4; Tr. 50.) \n \n \nPursuant to a plea deal, on March 9, 2015, Applicant pleaded guilty to the March \n2012 felony sale of a controlled substance and the April 2012 misdemeanor OUI (arrested \nin December 2012). In exchange, the prosecutor entered nolle prosequi dispositions for the \nApril 2012 reckless driving infraction and all of the criminal charges filed against him since \nJuly 2013.4 Applicant was sentenced for OUI to six months in jail (suspended); 18 months \nof supervised probation, to be served concurrent with his probation for the felony drug \ncharge; a fine of $500; and 100 hours of community service. For the felony sale of a \ncontrolled substance, he was sentenced to five years in jail, suspended; three years of \nsupervised probation; and 50 hours of community service. (GEs 1, 3-4; Tr. 67-70.) In \napproximately May 2015, Applicant cut his ties with those friends involved with marijuana. \n(Tr. 33.) \n                                                 \n3 During his subject interview in March 2017, Applicant inaccurately recalled the possession and drug sale \ncharges as occurring in September 2013. (GE 4.) \n \n4 A nolle prosequi (shortened as \u201cnolle\u201d in the FBI record) is a formal entry on the record by a prosecutor by \nwhich he or she declares that there will be no further prosecution. \n\n6 \n \n \nApplicant was drug tested during his probation on a regular basis, and all of the \ntests were negative. (Tr. 70.) He was also required to complete counseling for his \nmarijuana use and to complete an Ignition Interlock Device (IID) Program. Applicant had \nsubstance abuse counseling from April 2015 to July 2015, which he asserts \u201cdefinitely \nstarted to drive [him], wake [him] up a little bit in the right direction.\u201d (Tr. 40-41.) On his \ncompletion of the IID program on September 26, 2016, the interlock device was removed \nfrom his vehicle. He successfully completed his probations for the OUI on September 9, \n2016, and for the felony sale of a controlled substance on March 9, 2018. (GEs 1, 3-4; AEs \nB-C.) \n \n \nAs part of his employment application to work for his defense-contractor employer, \nApplicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF 86) on October 29, 2015. He disclosed his arrest record; his use of marijuana \n(\u201cSmoked a blunt once a day\u201d) from June 2010 to June 2014; his sales of marijuana to his \nfriends once or twice a week from May 2012 to June 2014 \u201cdue to the surroundings in \nwhich the substance brought upon [him];\u201d and his completion of counseling for his \nmarijuana use in 2012 and 2015. He denied any intention to use marijuana in the future for \nthe following reason: \n \nMarijuana has changed my life in a very negative way. Bad characteristics \nhad been introduced and held onto, through this substance. Through me \nquitting this substance I\u2019m more motivated and ready to pursue my career \nand maintain a happy standard of living. (GE 1.) \n \n \nIn July 2016, Applicant earned his automotive technician certificate. (GE 4; Tr. 20.) \nHe has since worked in the automotive industry, primarily in sales, without any adverse \nincidents. (GEs 1, 4.) \n \n \nOn March 2, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant discussed his criminal charges, his \nmarijuana use, his alcohol use, and his involuntary termination from some previous jobs. \nHe indicated that the date of his last use of marijuana was accurately reported on his SF \n86 and that he was no longer associating with any known illegal drug users. About his \nalcohol use, he indicated that his drinking had decreased since early 2015 to once a month \nand not to intoxication. He admitted that he drank to intoxication once a week until early \n2015. He denied any intention to use marijuana or any other illegal drug in the future. He \ndid not expect his drinking habit to change in the future. (GE 4.) \n \n \nOn September 20, 2017, Applicant responded to interrogatories from the DOD CAF \nconcerning his illegal drug use. He indicated that he had used cannabis a total of 20 times \nin 2011, 2012, and 2014. He responded affirmatively to an inquiry concerning whether he \nhad ever purchased, sold, transported, or manufactured the drug. He also listed a one-time \nuse of Xanax in 2015, which was apparently obtained from his mother-in-law who has a \nprescription. He was working and going to school and used it as a sleep aid. (Tr. 41-42.) \nHe denied any use of marijuana since his arrest in March 2014.5 Applicant indicated that \n                                                 \n5 Applicant disclosed discrepantly on his SF 86 that he used marijuana (\u201csmoked a blunt once a day\u201d) to June \n\n7 \n \nhe did not have any illegal drugs or paraphernalia in his possession and that he had no \ncurrent association with any illegal drug users.  He also responded \u201cYes\u201d to whether he had \never participated in any drug or alcohol rehabilitation program and disclosed that he had \ninpatient therapeutic meetings from March 2015 to June 2015. (GE 2.) \n  \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant testified that he has put his past behind him and wanted \nthe opportunity to work for the defense contractor that is sponsoring him for a clearance. \n(Tr. 24-25.) He denies any marijuana use since June 2014 and any current association with \nillegal drug users. He spends his time outside of work with his fianc\u00e9e and their daughter. \nHe and his fianc\u00e9e began dating around the time of his last arrest in 2014, and they are \ncurrently cohabitants. (Tr. 32, 73.) His fianc\u00e9e works as a dental assistant. (Tr. 32-33.) He \nattributes his turnaround to his probation officer, who became a mentor to him. (Tr. 72.) \n  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \n                                                                                                                                                             \n2014. The FBI record indicates that he was arrested on two counts each of illegal possession of marijuana \nand sale of a controlled substance on June 26, 2014. Applicant was not confronted about the discrepancy \nbetween that information and his interrogatory responses that he used marijuana only 20 times and that he \nceased his marijuana use in March 2014. \n\n8 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern about criminal conduct is articulated in AG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nThe criminal conduct concerns are established by Applicant\u2019s March 2012 felony \nsale of a controlled substance; his April 2012 misdemeanor OUI; his June 2013 \nmisdemeanor assault; and his March 2014 and June 2014 felony sale of a controlled \nsubstance and felony marijuana possession offenses. Two disqualifying conditions under \nAG \u00b6 31 apply because of his aforesaid criminal conduct between the ages of 18 and 20: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be unlikely \nto affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in combination cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness; and \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an admission, \nand matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nindividual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n \n \nApplicant has only two adult convictions on his record, which are for the 2012 felony \ndrug sale and misdemeanor OUI offenses. The prosecutor\u2019s decision to enter nolle and no \nlonger pursue the remaining charges against Applicant does not preclude the \nadministrative judge from considering the conduct for its security significance under AG \u00b6 \n31(b). In that regard, Applicant had a physical altercation with a minor in June 2013. When \nhe was arrested in March 2014, he had in his possession three bags of marijuana that he \nhad intended to sell at a party. In June 2014, he went to a parking lot with marijuana to sell \nto his friend. \n \n\n9 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31(c), \u201cindividual is currently on parole or probation,\u201d was applicable as of the \nissuance of the SOR in October 2017 because Applicant was then on supervised probation \nfor the March 2012 felony sale of a controlled substance offense. It no longer applies \nbecause he successfully completed his probation on March 9, 2018, 11 days before his \nsecurity clearance hearing.  \n \n   \nApplicant has the burden of establishing the applicability of one or more of the \nmitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32, which provide: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life; \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand  \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to, \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement. \n \n \nApplicant has not been arrested since June 26, 2014. However, he admitted at his \nhearing that he continued to sell marijuana until September 2014 to pay for a lawyer and \nbecause he had some marijuana after his arrest and was not going to give it away. He was \nfired from a retail job in November 2014 after he was caught stealing some food. His \nemployment termination was only alleged under Guideline E, but the reason for his firing \nhas ramifications for his rehabilitation of his criminal conduct. The Appeal Board has \nrecently affirmed in ISCR Case No. 16-00792, decided on May 14, 2018 (citing e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 15-07369 (App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017)), that \u201cconduct not alleged or otherwise fairly \nembraced by the SOR may be relevant for other purposes: making a credibility \ndetermination; evaluating the applicant\u2019s case for extenuation or mitigation; evaluating the \nextent to which the applicant has demonstrated rehabilitation; and in performing a whole-\nperson analysis.\u201d SOR \u00b6 1.f alleges disposition of Applicant\u2019s criminal offenses from March \n2012 through June 2014. AG \u00b6 32(c) applies to SOR \u00b6 1.f in that it was not shown that \nApplicant committed any criminal conduct in March 2015. \n \n \nGiven the recidivist nature of Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct, and the fact that he was \non probation for a felony offense until March 9, 2018, it is difficult to apply AG \u00b6 32(a) in \nmitigation. Applicant had every reason to ensure that he abided by the law during his \nprobation in that any violation could have resulted in him being prosecuted for the charges \nthat were nolled. He completed his probation only 11 days before his security clearance \n\n10 \n \nhearing, which is not long enough to show law-abiding behavior without threat of further \nprosecution. \n \n \nApplicant has demonstrated some reform under AG \u00b6 32(d) by successfully \ncompleting his probations for the OUI and felony drug sale with no evidence of any \nviolation over the three years; by finishing his schooling and obtaining his certification as an \nautomotive technician in July 2016; and by working in the automotive sales industry, \napparently without any problems. He asserts that, in May 2015, he terminated his \nassociations with those now former friends involved in criminal activity. He expressed full \nconfidence that his criminal conduct is behind him. Yet, he also exhibited an unacceptable \ntendency to minimize or even justify some of his criminal conduct. He testified about the \nJuly 2013 assault of a minor, as follows: \n \nThey said that [the minor] was bleeding. And they said that he was hurt. But \nthe only thing I did to him was I put him in a headlock and I had to calm him \ndown. He kept trying to swing at me. But I already knew that he was young \nand underage. So I just basically restrained him. And even after the fact that \nhe spit on me even after everything got broken up and all that stuff. (Tr. 64.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s response to why he continued to sell marijuana after June 2014 while he \nhad felony drug sale charges pending against him, i.e., that he had to pay his lawyer and \nalso that he had \u201csome [marijuana] just lingering around. So [he] wasn\u2019t going to give it \naway,\u201d was not accompanied by any expression of remorse for his disregard of the law.  \nApplicant is credited with those steps he has taken to become a more mature, responsible, \nlaw-abiding person, but he has not yet fully mitigated the serious criminal conduct security \nconcerns raised by his repeated felonious drug activity. \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concerns about drug involvement and substance misuse are set \nforth in AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above. \n  \nApplicant used marijuana on a daily basis between approximately June 2010 and \nJune 2014. He purchased marijuana for his personal consumption and also for sales to \nfriends and persons referred by friends. He sold marijuana, at times as often as once or \n\n11 \n \ntwice a week, between approximately March 2012 and September 2014. He was arrested \nthree times for sale of a controlled substance (marijuana) in March 2012, March 2014, and \nJune 2014. He supported himself financially by selling marijuana during his unemployment \nfrom August 2013 to September 2014.6 Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany \nsubstance misuse (see above definition),\u201d and AG \u00b6 25(c), \u201cillegal possession of a \ncontrolled substance, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or \ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia,\u201d are well established. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) provides for mitigation when the drug involvement and substance misuse \n\u201chappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d There is no evidence of any illegal drug activity by \nApplicant after September 2014. The passage of more than three years since then is \nnoted, but the regularity of his use of the drug and his repeated sales of the drug, at times \nfor profit, undermine his case for mitigation under AG \u00b6 26(a). \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) provides for mitigation when an individual acknowledges his or her drug \ninvolvement and has no intention of future drug activity: \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n \n \nApplicant had drug counseling from September 2012 to November 2012 following \nhis March 2012 arrest for illegal drug sales, but he continued to use marijuana. He had \ntreatment more recently for his marijuana use from approximately April 2015 to July 2015 \nas a condition of his plea agreement in March 2015. He gave discrepant dates for his last \nuse of marijuana of June 2014 on his October 2015 SF 86 and of March 2014 on his \nSeptember 2017 response to interrogatories. The discrepancy could possibly be attributed \nto inaccurate recall of the date of his last arrest. There is no evidence of any illegal drug \nactivity by Applicant since summer 2015, when he used Xanax as a sleep aid while working \nand going to school.7 He presented documentation showing that he successfully completed \n                                                 \n6 Applicant disclosed in September 2017 that he had used Xanax illegally one time in 2015. It was not alleged \nin the SOR so it is not being considered as a factor in disqualification. \n \n7 Applicant testified that he used the Xanax when he was working two jobs and going to school. (Tr. 41-42.) He \nstarted his automotive technician program in July 2015, so his drug use would have occurred sometime that \nsummer. \n\n12 \n \nhis probation for sale of a controlled substance. He testified that he had taken and passed \ndrug screens during his probation. Applicant has been consistent in denying any intention \nof use marijuana in the future. Even though he did not provide a statement of intent to \nabstain with the acknowledgement that any future drug involvement would be grounds for \nrevocation of national security eligibility, he responded negatively in his response to \ninterrogatories about whether he intended to use cannabis or Xanax in the future. Applicant \nunderstands that he would be required to maintain a drug-free lifestyle if given the \nopportunity to work for a defense contractor. Applicant testified that he is currently in a \ncohabitant relationship with his fianc\u00e9e and their daughter, which could serve as a \nsignificant deterrent to relapse. \n \n \nRegarding Applicant\u2019s drug sales, which are cross-alleged under Guideline H in the \nSOR, the Appeal Board has long held that conduct may have security concern under more \nthan one guideline. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06- 21537 (App. Bd. Feb. 21, 2008). \nGuideline H concerns are raised not only by the use of illegal drugs because of the \nphysiological impairment, but by the disregard for laws exhibited by such drug activity as \npurchase and sale. Applicant sold marijuana, not only to cover the cost of marijuana for his \npersonal consumption but also for profit to obtain some funds to live on when he was \nunemployed and to pay for an attorney. His felony drug sales raise considerable security \nconcerns that are not yet fully mitigated for the reasons stated under Guideline J.   \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern about personal conduct is articulated in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigations or \nadjudicative processes. \n \n \nApplicant unquestionably exercised poor judgment triggering AG \u00b6 15 by using \nmarijuana on a daily basis for approximately four years; by selling marijuana, including at \ntimes for profit and while facing felony criminal drug charges; by driving when he was so \nintoxicated that he blacked out in April 2012; and by assaulting a minor in July 2013. \nRegarding his termination for cause (SOR \u00b6 4.a), Applicant was fired from three jobs for \nreasons not related to job performance: from a doughnut shop for excessive tardiness from \npartying the previous evening; from a retail position for being a no-show, although he also \nsuspects that co-workers complained about him rolling a \u201cblunt\u201d of marijuana on the jobsite; \nand from a retail job for stealing. AG \u00b6 16(d) is implicated because of his employment \nterminations, which are not otherwise covered under the guidelines. That disqualifying \ncondition provides: \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other \nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but \n\n13 \n \nwhich, when combined with all available information, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This includes, but is \nnot limited to, consideration of: \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16(g), \u201cassociation with persons involved in criminal activity,\u201d could have \napplied in that friends sold him marijuana or facilitated his drug sales by purchasing \nmarijuana from him or referring other buyers to him. However, his association with them \nwas not alleged as a separate security concern. \n \n \nThree mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 could potentially apply. They are: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or \nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwilling, has \nceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with \nrules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is only minimally established. His employment termination from the \ndoughnut shop in August 2013 is of minor security concern, even though he was \napparently issued written warnings before his termination. The OUI and assault were \nisolated in nature. The same cannot be said about his regular use of marijuana over some \nfour years or about his marijuana sales that persisted despite pending felony charges \nagainst him. Theft from an employer has serious security implications, even if it was only \nfood of minimal value, because it is a violation of a trust relationship. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d) is partially satisfied by Applicant\u2019s efforts to become a productive, law-\nabiding citizen, as discussed under Guidelines J and H. Applicant has a record of \nconsistent employment in the automotive industry since July 2016, which weighs in his \nfavor with regard to the concerns raised by his previous terminations for cause. He denies \nany current association with those now former friends involved in illegal drug activities, so \nAG \u00b6 17(g) seemingly is also established. It provides: \n \n\n14 \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, has \nceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with \nrules and regulations. \n \n \nHowever, in assessing whether Applicant possesses the requisite good judgment \nthat must be demanded from persons in a national security sensitive position, I cannot \nignore that Applicant may have significantly underreported his marijuana use when he \nresponded to interrogatories in September 2017. Applicant inexplicably indicated that he \nhad used cannabis only 20 times total when he had previously admitted to using marijuana \non a daily basis for approximately four years. No falsification was alleged, but the \nunexplained discrepancy make it more difficult to find that his personal conduct is no longer \nof significant security concern. Separate from the issue of whether his marijuana use will \nrecur, he showed extremely poor judgment by disregarding the drug laws for several years. \nWhile he is commended for those steps he has taken in reform, personal conduct concerns \npersist. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nIn the whole-person evaluation, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).8 Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under \nGuidelines J, H, and E, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \n \nLikely due to his youth and immaturity, Applicant was unable or unwilling to comply \nwith laws, rules, and regulations relating to assaultive behavior, illegal drug activity, and \ntheft. He is to be commended for the steps he has taken with the help of his probation \nofficer to turn his life around and become a productive young adult. He completed \nautomotive technician school in July 2016, and completed the terms of his sentences for \nhis felony OUI and felony sale of a controlled drug. Yet, it is well settled that once a \nconcern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong \npresumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, \n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). In that regard, Applicant needs more time to show \nthat he possesses the good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness that national security \neligibility requires and that he will not be negatively influenced by people not acting in his \nbest interest. Based on all the information presented, I cannot find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant security clearance eligibility at this \ntime. \n                                                 \n8 The factors under AG \u00b6 2(d) are as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n\n15 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline G:  \nWITHDRAWN \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \nWithdrawn \n \nParagraph 4, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 4.a-4.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_____________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

Eligibility to occupy a public trust position is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn February 19, 2015, Applicant applied for a public trust position and submitted \nan Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). On October 13, 2017, \nthe Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to her under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and \nmodified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); DOD Manual \n5200.02, Procedures for the DOD Personnel Security Program (PSP) (April 3, 2017) \n(Manual); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG), for all covered individuals who \nrequire initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold \na sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n01/04/2019\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nThe SOR alleged trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations) and detailed reasons why the DOD CAF was unable to make an \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for occupying a public trust position to support a contract \nwith the DOD. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \nwhether such eligibility should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on October 25, 2017. In a sworn statement, dated \nNovember 8, 2017, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to \nproceed on December 8, 2017. The case was assigned to me on March 20, 2018. A \nNotice of Hearing was issued on June 29, 2018, and amended on July 11, 2018, \nscheduling the hearing for July 24, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Government exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 4 and Applicant \nexhibits (AE) A through AE I were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on August 3, 2018. I kept the record open to \nenable Applicant to supplement it. She took advantage of that opportunity and timely \nsubmitted several documents, which were marked and admitted as AE J through AE Q, \nwithout objection. The record closed on August 21, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, all of the factual \nallegations pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.g.). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration \nof same, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving \nas a claims processer with her current employer since May 1998. She graduated from \nhigh school in 1983. She also received an associate\u2019s degree in 1985. She has never \nserved in the U.S. military. She has never held a security clearance, but has been \noccupying a position of public trust since 1998. Applicant was married in 1985. She has \none son, born in 2000. \n \nFinancial Considerations1 \n  \nThere was nothing unusual about Applicant\u2019s finances until 2006 when she \ndecided not to place her mother in a nursing home and instead became her caretaker. \nApplicant\u2019s mother was afflicted with a variety of health issues: diabetes, high blood \n                                                          \n1 General source information pertaining to the financial issues discussed below can be found in the \nfollowing exhibits: GE 1 (e-QIP, dated February 19, 2015); GE 2 (Personal Subject Interview, dated \nDecember 4, 2015); GE 3 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated June 4, \n2016); GE 4 (Equifax Credit Report, dated September 29, 2017); and Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, dated \nNovember 8, 2017.   \n  \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \npressure, diabetes-related foot surgery, and Alzheimer\u2019s. Eventually her mother\u2019s \nsituations necessitated obtaining a wheelchair, a lifter (to get her into and out of bed, and \na ramp for egress and ingress to and from the house. Although there was some financial \nsupport through Medicare and Medicaid, Applicant was responsible for uncovered \nexpenses. In 2009, Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law died from cancer. Applicant\u2019s husband lost \nhis $25 an hour job in 2010 when his company shut down in the area. In order to generate \nsome income, he started driving a bus (making between $13 and $15 per hour) and he \ndid seasonal landscaping. Applicant was also forced to borrow funds from her 401(k). In \n2012, Applicant\u2019s son was diagnosed with keratoconus \u2013 a progressive eye disease \u2013 \nthat resulted in three surgeries in 2013 and one in 2015, as well as different prescription \nmedications which he continues to take. In 2013, Applicant\u2019s mother passed away. In \nJune 2015, her husband had foot surgery, and he was out of work for two months.  \nThe continuing combination of family health issues caused expenses to increase, \nand her husband\u2019s health and employment issues reduced the family income. As a result, \nsome accounts became delinquent. A federal tax lien was filed when Applicant\u2019s husband \nerred in applying his Form 1099 associated with his landscaping earnings. As a result, \ntheir anticipated federal income tax refund for a subsequent year was applied to the \nearlier year. Applicant\u2019s most recent federal and state income tax refunds amounted to \nover $4,000, and those funds were used primarily to make mortgage payments to make \nsure it remained current, and for her son\u2019s school expenses. \nThe SOR identified seven purportedly delinquent accounts that had been placed \nfor collection or charged-off, as generally reflected by Applicant\u2019s June 2016 or \nSeptember 2017 credit reports. Those debts total approximately $34,302. The current \nstatus of those accounts is as follows: \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a.): This is a joint installment loan with an unpaid and past-due balance \nof $13,438 that was placed for collection and charged off.2 Applicant reached out to the \ncreditor and agreed to a repayment plan under which she commenced making monthly \n$50 payments before November 2017. She submitted documentation of routine past \nmonthly payments with a recent receipt, dated July 25, 2018, reflecting a reduced \nremaining balance of $12,988.3 Applicant also discussed settlement possibilities, and the \ncreditor initially offered to settle the account for a one-time payment of $6,494, or a \nmonthly payment of $780 for ten months, neither of which Applicant could afford. Another \noption was an increased monthly payment of $75, commencing in September 2018. \nApplicant claimed that she agreed to this option,4 but she has not submitted any \ndocuments to support any such payments. Nevertheless, the account is in the process of \nbeing resolved. \n                                                          \n2 GE 3, supra note 1, at 6; GE 4, supra note 1, at 2; GE 2, supra note 1, at 7. \n \n3 AE B (Receipts, various dates); AE O (Receipt, dated July 25, 2018); Answer to the SOR, dated \nNovember 8, 2017, at 1. \n \n4 AE N (Statement, undated). \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b.): This is an unspecified type of account with an unpaid and past-due \nbalance of $3,891 that was placed for collection and sold to a debt purchaser.5 Applicant \nreached out to the debt purchaser and agreed to a repayment plan under which she \ncommenced making monthly $50 payments before November 2017. She submitted \ndocumentation of routine past monthly payments with a recent receipt, dated July 24, \n2018, reflecting a cumulative payment of $350.6 Applicant also discussed a settlement \npossibility, but Applicant could not afford the one offered to her. She intends to increase \nher monthly payments for six months before exploring another settlement option.7 \nNevertheless, the account is in the process of being resolved. \n (SOR \u00b6 1.c.): This is a joint secured installment loan, which Applicant claims was \nmade to purchase a vehicle, with an unpaid balance of $3,727 that was placed for \ncollection and charged off in 2014.8 Applicant contends that she called the original creditor \nand the eventual creditor, to validate the account, but neither creditor had any information \nabout it. She claims that she searched for paperwork and found a letter stating that the \nbalance was $463.50, and that on February 28, 2014, she paid the creditor $471.22 with \nher debit card and has a confirmation number.9 While Applicant is specific in her \nreferences and claims, she failed to submit any documents to: (1) connect the original \ncreditor to the eventual creditor; (2) support her position that she contacted the creditors \nor was advised that they had no information regarding the accounts; (3) support her \nposition that she made the claimed payment; or (4) support her position that the account \nhas been paid in full. Until those documents are submitted, it is impossible to determine \nthe current status of the account. The account has not been resolved. \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d. and 1.g.): These are two medical accounts with unpaid balances of \n$101 and $123 that were placed for collection and charged off.10 Applicant and the \ncreditor agreed to a settlement regarding the smaller of the two accounts, and on \nDecember 10, 2015 \u2013 two years before the SOR was issued \u2013 she paid the remaining \nbalance of $76.13, settling the account in full. With respect to the larger of the two \naccounts, on December 10, 2015 \u2013 again two years before the SOR was issued \u2013 she \npaid the creditor $123.84.11 Both accounts have been resolved. \n                                                          \n5 GE 3, supra note 1, at 6; GE 4, supra note 1, at 2. \n \n6 AE C (Receipts, various dates, and Bank Account History, dated July 24, 2018); AE P (Receipt, \ndated July 24, 2018); Answer to the SOR, supra note 3, at 1; Tr. at 45. \n \n7 AE N, supra note 4, at 1; Answer to the SOR, supra note 3, at 1. \n \n8 GE 3, supra note 1, at 7; GE 4, supra note 1, at 2; GE 2, supra note 1, at 6. \n \n9 Answer to the SOR, supra note 3, at 1. \n \n10 GE 3, supra note 1, at 15; GE 4, supra note 1, at 2; Answer to the SOR, supra note 3, at 1-2. \n \n11 AE D (Payment History, dated May 9, 2007); Answer to the SOR, supra note 3, at 1-2.

The September 2017, incorrectly reports the smaller \naccount as unpaid. See GE 4, supra note 1, at 2. \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e.): This is consumer loan from a financial institution with a high credit of \nabout $10,000 that was placed for collection. A judgment for $11,524 was filed in 2014.12 \nApplicant explained that she had made monthly payments of about $300 for two to three \nyears. When her financial issues made it difficult to make the regular payments, the \ncreditor agreed to accept reduced payments.13 She failed to submit any documentation \nto support her contention that before the judgment was filed she had made any payments. \nBy July 2017, the unpaid balance on the judgment had increased to $14,272, including \ninterest. Applicant reached out to the collection attorneys and discussed settlement \npossibilities, and she was offered a proposed settlement of 60 percent of the existing \nbalance to be paid by October 2017,14 but she was unable to agree to that offer. \nNegotiations continued, and in November 2017, Applicant agreed to a repayment plan \nunder which she authorized automatic withdrawals from her account in the amount of \n$50. She submitted documentation of routine past monthly payments. Unfortunately for \nApplicant, despite her continuing monthly payments, because of the accrual of interest, \nthe unpaid balance keeps increasing. As of April 2018, it was $14,659.15 Applicant \nintended to continue making the monthly payments, and after six months, she expected \nto receive another settlement offer. While the record is silent as to what subsequent \nevents had occurred, the account is in the process of being resolved. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.f.): This is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $1,499 that \nwas placed for collection and sold to a debt purchaser.16 Applicant reached out to the \ndebt purchaser and agreed to a repayment plan under which she authorized automatic \nwithdrawals from her account in the amount of $63. She submitted documentation of \nroutine past monthly payments, and expects the account to be paid in full by August \n2019.17 The account is in the process of being resolved. \nIn addition to the accounts alleged in the SOR, Applicant addressed various other \naccounts that were not alleged in the SOR, and they have been resolved. Other than the \naccounts alleged in the SOR, Applicant is not aware of any other delinquent accounts. \nFollowing the hearing, Applicant prepared a Personal Financial Statement to reflect her \ncombined monthly net income ($4,572); monthly expenses ($4,324), including those \nmade to her creditors described above; and a monthly remainder ($203) available for \ndiscretionary saving or spending.18 The unanticipated expenses associated with the \n                                                          \n12 GE 3, supra note 1, at 5, 10; GE 2, supra note 1, at 4; Answer to the SOR, supra note 3, at 2. \n \n13 GE 2, supra note 1, at 4. \n \n14 AE E (Letter, dated August 1, 2017).

In July \n2018, Applicant completed financial counseling with a certified financial planner.19 \nCharacter References and Work Performance \n \nOne friend, who has known Applicant for 15 years, described her as a hard-working \nperson of integrity who is very hospitable, disciplined, kind-hearted, loyal, strong, and \nmorally excellent.20 Applicant\u2019s annual performance reviews over the years generally \nreflect an individual whose performance exceeds expectations, although there are \ninstances where she is either exceptional or merely meets expectations.21 \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a [position of public trust].\u201d22 As Commander in Chief, the President \nhas the authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to \ndetermine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation.

(3)(c). \n \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a public trust position. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common \nsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d25 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nhas the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation \nor mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.26  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to sensitive \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.  Furthermore, security clearance \ndeterminations, and by inference, public trust determinations, should err, if they must, on \nthe side of denials.27 In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n \n \n                                                          \n25 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla \nbut less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. \n1994). \n \n26 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n27 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations \nis set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b619:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant failed to maintain several accounts in a current status and a number of \nthem became delinquent. Accounts were placed for collection or charged-off, and in one \ninstance, a judgment was filed. Those debts total approximately $34,302. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) have been established. AG \u00b6 19(b) has not been established because there is \nno evidence that Applicant had the ability to pay her debts but was unwilling to do so.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate \ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;28 \n                                                          \n28 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can \napplicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed \nas recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \n \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.29  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) all fully or partially apply. Applicant\u2019s financial \ndifficulties arose initially in 2006 and continued until 2015 with significant health issues \ninvolving her mother, mother-in-law, husband, and son. They were exacerbated when her \nhusband lost his job. The continuing combination of family health and employment issues, \nall of which individually and cumulatively were largely beyond her control, increased \nfamily expenses and reduced the family income. Applicant acted responsibly by seeking \ninformation from her creditors or collection agents.30 She reached out to the various \ncreditors, collection attorneys, and collection agents, and discussed settlement \npossibilities. Applicant paid off her non-SOR debts as well as some SOR debts, and \nentered into repayment agreements with other creditors. As her debts were reduced, \nApplicant continued making her monthly payments with the intention of increasing those \npayments as the opportunity to do so presented itself. Applicant offered substantial \nevidence to indicate that her financial situation is now under better control. She also \n                                                          \n29 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some \nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not \ndefine the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must do more than \nmerely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy [or \nstatute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n30 \u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable \nmanner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, \n2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. \nDec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current. \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nreceived financial counseling. Applicant\u2019s actions under the circumstances no longer cast \ndoubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.31 \nTrustworthiness decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines \ndo not require an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the \nSOR. An applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant \nimmediately resolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, \nnor is there a requirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. \nRather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such \ndebts, or resolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the \nfuture, without further confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, however, \nApplicant\u2019s promises transitioned into positive action, and she now has a history of \nfulfilling her promises. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of public trust by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \neligibility for a position of public trust must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I \nhave evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record \nevidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.32 \n  \n \nThere is some evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Seven of \nApplicant\u2019s accounts, totaling $34,302, became delinquent when she failed to maintain \nthem in a current status. They were placed for collection or charged-off, and in one \ninstance, a judgment was filed. \n                                                          \n31 See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \n \n32 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-\n3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \n \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving as a \nclaims processer \u2013 a position of public trust \u2013 with her current employer since May 1998. \nShe has been described as a hard-working person of integrity who is very hospitable, \ndisciplined, kind-hearted, loyal, strong, and morally excellent. Her annual performance \nreviews generally reflect an individual whose performance exceeds expectations. Rather \nthan simply ignoring her creditors, Applicant reached out to them and discussed \nsettlement or repayment possibilities. She paid off her non-SOR debts as well as some \nSOR debts, and entered into repayment agreements with other creditors. She has \ncontinued to make her regular anticipated payments under those agreements. \n \nOverall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a position of public trust. For all of these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has successfully mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from her \nfinancial issues. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.g.:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a position of public \ntrust to support a contract with the DOD.  Eligibility is granted. \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n________________________ \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the security concern stemming from his problematic federal and state tax \nhistory. Accordingly, this case is decided for Applicant.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 2, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging that \nhis circumstances raised security concerns under the financial considerations guideline. \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 15, 2017, and requested a hearing to \nestablish his eligibility for continued access to classified information.1 \n1 This action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended, as well as Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). In \naddition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), \neffective within the Defense Department on June 8, 2017, apply here.    \n09/26/2018\n\n2 \n \n \nOn June 29, 2018, a date mutually agreed to by the parties, a hearing was held. \nApplicant testified at the hearing, and the exhibits offered by the parties were admitted \ninto the administrative record without objection. (Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \u2013 3; \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A \u2013 C.) The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on July \n11, 2018. At the request of Applicant, without objection, the record remained open until \nJuly 16, 2018. Applicant timely submitted a document that was marked as AE D and was \nadmitted without objection. On September 11, 2018, I sua sponte reopened the record \nuntil close of business Friday, September 14, 2018, to allow Applicant to submit additional \ndocuments. Applicant submitted documents I have marked as AE E, F, G, and H, which \nwere admitted without objection.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 71 years old, married, has three adult sons, and one adult daughter. \nHe has a Bachelor of Science degree and three years of post-graduate work. From 1969 \nuntil 2004, Applicant was employed by a major defense contractor. In 2004, he retired, \nand he and his wife formed a limited liability company (\u201cLLC\u201d) to service DOD contracts.2  \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted to the federal Government on two tax \nliens totaling $118,261 and one state tax lien in the amount of $5,585.3 Applicant admitted \nthe SOR allegations.4 \n \nApplicant testified about the LLC he and his wife established. By 2004, Applicant \nhad spent 35 years employed by a major defense contractor. That year, his employer \noffered an attractive buy-out package. He and his wife decided that he should accept that \npackage. Instead of retiring, however, Applicant and his wife formed their own company \nto service DOD contracts directly or to work for prime contractors on DOD contracts. \nApplicant was a 40% owner of the LLC, and his wife was a 60% owner. They also agreed \non a division of labor. Applicant\u2019s wife was to be responsible for administrative matters, \nsuch as paying bills, including tax bills, review of new contracts, and collecting accounts \nreceivable. Applicant was responsible for technical matters, such as generating new \nbusiness, hiring, technical direction, and interacting with clients.5 \n \nThe LLC operated under this model successfully until between 2010 to 2012. \nDuring that time frame, Applicant\u2019s wife gradually developed some very serious health \nproblems. Ultimately, she had to undergo a major operation. She began to fall behind in \ncarrying out her business obligations, including the payment of state and federal taxes. \nThis resulted in the liens alleged in the SOR.6 To make financial matters worse, Applicant \n                                                          \n2 GE 1; AE A; Tr. 8, 23-24.  \n \n3 SOR \u00b6 1. \n \n4 Answer \u00b6 1. \n \n5 Tr. 24-26; AE A, p. 3.  \n \n6 AE A, p. 3; Tr. 36-37 \n\n3 \n \ndiscovered that some of the LLC\u2019s prime contractors were seriously late in paying the \nLLC\u2019s invoices. In fact, one of the LLC\u2019s clients was eight months late in paying a \nsubstantial bill. This made the LLC late and delinquent on its taxes. When Applicant did \nreceive overdue payments from customers, he faced a choice between paying back taxes \nor paying his employees. He testified that he and his wife agreed that it was more \nimportant to keep their employees onboard than to catch up on back taxes but lose \nemployees.7  \n \nBy 2013, Applicant realized that he had seriously under-estimated the gravity of \nhis tax problems. Although he testified that he had made about $155,000 in payments \ntowards back federal taxes, he still owes over $100,000 (reflected in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c). \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he was waiting for a revised installment plan to \naddress those federal taxes based on his downward revenue projections. Applicant was \ntold by the IRS to stop paying under the old installment plan and to just keep his taxes \ncurrent until a new installment plan was approved. He complied.8 Applicant has also been \npaying installments on the state tax lien alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a.  Applicant and his wife \nhave remained current in paying their quarterly taxes for years 2014 through 2016.9  \n \nIn light of the financial circumstances facing Applicant and his wife and another \nserious medical condition his wife developed about five months ago, they have adopted \na new business model. Applicant\u2019s wife has stepped out of the business. Applicant will \ntake responsibility for administrative and technical duties. To assist with the administrative \nduties, Applicant hired an executive assistant in May 2017.10 He also put his customers \non 30-day payment terms.11 The LLC has been in the black for the last couple of years \nand with one exception has been paying its bills and taxes on time.12 The exception is a \nlien filed by the state a few weeks ago for back unemployment compensation taxes in the \namount of about $13,000. Applicant explained that he and his wife inadvertently missed \na quarterly filing and payment, which triggered a much steeper tax rate (an 800% \nincrease).  Applicant has an installment agreement with the state to pay off that lien.13 \n \nApplicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions reflect the current state of his LLC\u2019s tax \nindebtedness:   \n \n                                                          \n7 Tr. 26-27, 35-38.  \n \n8 Tr. 39-40; AE A, p. 3.  \n \n9 Tr. 49, 59-60, 84.  \n \n10 Tr. 33, 72-73, 75, 86. \n \n11 Tr. 33-35.  \n \n12 Tr. 49, 61-62, 70.  \n \n13 Tr. 52-54, 59-60. Because it was filed only recently, the lien was not alleged in the SOR. The Government \ndid not move to amend the SOR to add this lien.  \n \n\n4 \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a (back state taxes) has been under a payment plan since January 2014. \nAs of November 2017, Applicant has paid $2,550, leaving a balance due of $3,653.57.14 \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c (liens for back federal taxes totaling $109,230) are under a \npayment plan dated December 13, 2017. Those tax liens go back as far as tax year \n2010.15 Applicant documented the monthly payments under this plan from January 2018 \nthrough September 2018.16 This plan supplanted an earlier installment payment plan \nunder which Applicant paid $151,756 from March 2010 to December 2015.17 \n \nThe recently filed unalleged lien for back state unemployment compensation taxes \n($13,000) is under a payment plan dated July 3, 2018.18 \n \nApplicant submitted 16 character reference letters.19 Many of the authors of those \nletters have known Applicant for over 40 years in their professional or personal capacities, \nsometimes in both. The letters uniformly commended him on his \u201cexemplary honesty,\u201d \n\u201cintegrity,\u201d \u201cprofessionalism,\u201d and \u201cloyalty.\u201d Many of the authors were aware of why they \nwere asked to write those letters.20  \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.

See also SEAD-4, \u00b6 E.4. \nMoreover, the Supreme Court has held that officials making \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain \ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of \ncompromise of classified information. \n \nDiscussion \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has a number of delinquent debts, which \npurportedly raise a security concern under Guideline F. The financial considerations \nsecurity concern is explained at AG \u00b6 18, which in pertinent part, states: \n  \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.  \n \n Guideline F is not limited to a consideration of whether a person with financial \nissues might be tempted to compromise classified information or engage in other illegality \nto pay their debts. It also addresses the extent to which the circumstances giving rise to \n\n6 \n \ndelinquent debt and other security-significant financial issues cast doubt upon a person\u2019s \nself-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified information.21 \n \n \nIn assessing Applicant\u2019s case, I considered the following pertinent disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \n AG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nA security clearance adjudication is not a debt-collection process. Rather, an \nadministrative judge examines the way an applicant handles his or her personal financial \nobligations to assess how they may handle their security obligations.22 Here, Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance eligibility was called into question by his past state and federal income \ntax delinquencies. I conclude that disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), (c), and (f) apply. \nThe next inquiry is whether any mitigating conditions apply.  \n \n \nA number of Applicant\u2019s federal and state tax liens reach back for a number of \nyears. They remain problematic, however, to the current day. Therefore, I cannot say that \nAG \u00b6 20(a) applies.   \n \n \nIn January 2014, long before the SOR was issued, Applicant entered into an \ninstallment payment agreement with his state tax authority to address his back state \nincome taxes. He is current on that agreement. That tax debt is mitigated under AG \u00b6 \n20(g).  \n                                                          \n21 ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May. 1, 2012).  \n22 See generally ISCR Case No. ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2016). \n \n\n7 \n \n \n \nThe nub of this case is the back federal taxes. A confluence of factors contributed \nto Applicant\u2019s federal tax delinquencies. He and his wife founded an LLC in 2004 to \nservice the defense industry. They agreed to a division labor, with Applicant handling \ntechnical matters and his wife handling administrative matters, including payment of bills \nand taxes and collecting accounts receivables. This not uncommon small business model \noperated successfully until 2010 to 2012.  \n \nIn that time frame, however, Applicant\u2019s wife developed serious health problems, \nwhich ultimately required major surgery.23 This was the first factor that contributed to the \ntax problems, his wife\u2019s inability to keep up with her administrative duties, including \npayment of taxes and collecting accounts receivables. The second factor was caused by \nthe first factor, namely that Applicant had to take over the burden of administrative \nmatters. The third factor was that at about the same time, Applicant realized that his wife \nhad been remiss in collecting overdue bills from customers, which aggravated the tax \nproblem. Faced with the unpleasant choice of either paying employees or paying taxes, \nhe and his wife agreed to pay their employees and come to some agreements with taxing \nauthorities.24 I conclude that the factors described above were conditions largely beyond \nApplicant\u2019s control under AG \u00b6 20(b). That does not, however, end the inquiry. The next \nquestion under AG \u00b6 20(b) is whether Applicant acted responsibly under the adverse \ncircumstances that contributed to his tax indebtedness.  \n \nFirst, when he gradually became aware that his wife had not been fulfilling her \nadministrative duties, Applicant took on those duties himself, in addition to shouldering \nthe technical duties.  \n \nSecond, from March 2010 to December 2015, Applicant adhered to a repayment \nplan under which his company paid $151,756.25 Based on his downward revisions of \nrevenue projections, he approached the IRS to set up a new payment plan. The IRS told \nhim to stop payment on the initial plan, keep up with current taxes, and await IRS\u2019s \napproval of a new plan. He complied, and in December 2017, the IRS approved a new \nplan, which Applicant has adhered to since then. \n                                                          \n23 Unfortunately, Applicant\u2019s wife developed another serious medical condition several months ago.   \n \n24 Applicant succeeded in coming to terms with the state tax authority in 2014.  Thus, the plan with the \nstate mitigated his back state taxes.   \n \n25 This history of payments is embodied in AE H, a summary of payments to the IRS under the initial plan. \nThe Government did not object to the admission of AE H. It did, however, argue that these payments were \nnot made under an installment agreement but were \u201cregular quarterly . . . business taxes,\u201d not \u201cseparate \npayments\u201d towards delinquent taxes. I respectfully disagree. Under the Government\u2019s cross-examination, \nApplicant\u2019s testimony, as I read it, was that his company paid an estimated $155,000 in back taxes. That \nfigure is consistent with AE H, which Applicant stated was a \u201cpayments history on the initial IRS installment \nagreement.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Government also noted that the summary of payments did not include \nany back-up documentation.  Federal Rule of Evidence 1006, which we use as a guide, allows for the \nadmission of summaries in place of voluminous documentation (such as six years of tax payments). In any \nevent, the Government did not request any such back-up documentation.  \n \n\n8 \n \n \nThird, Applicant and his wife also agreed that she should step out of the business \noperations. To that end, Applicant recently hired an administrative assistant to handle \nadministrative duties.  \n \nFourth, Applicant became more aggressive in collecting accounts receivable, \nputting his clients on net 30-day terms.  \n \nThese four steps not only addressed the back taxes owed, they did so in a way to \nminimize such an occurrence of tax arrearages in the future. This was responsible \nconduct. I conclude that Applicant has fully mitigated his problematic tax history under \nAG \u00b6 20(b).26 \n \nThe record does not raise doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \ngood judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I \nweighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed \nthe unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person \nconcept.27 Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion \nto show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):      For Applicant \n \n \n     Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \n \n \n \n    For Applicant \n \n \n \n____________________ \nPhilip J.

I can, however, consider the lien in weighing mitigation, whether Applicant has \ndemonstrated sufficient rehabilitation, under the whole person concept, and in weighing Applicant's \ncredibility. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). It appears that the lien was filed due to \nan inadvertent error by Applicant that dramatically increased the tax due. He promptly entered into a \npayment plan with the state taxing authority. That weighs in favor of Applicant\u2019s credibility.  \n \n27 AG \u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).

Hanley, Esq.   \n______________ \nDecision on Remand \n______________ \nKATAUSKAS, Philip J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant contested the Defense Department\u2019s intent to revoke his eligibility for \naccess to classified information based on security concerns stemming from his \nproblematic federal and state tax history. After a hearing and in a Decision dated \nSeptember 26, 2018, I found in favor of Applicant and granted him access to classified \ninformation (Decision). The Government appealed that Decision, and based upon the \nAppeal Board\u2019s December 18, 2018 Decision and on remand, as described more fully \nbelow, I find against Applicant. \nStatement of the Case on Appeal \nThe Statement of Reasons alleged that Applicant was indebted to the federal \nGovernment on two tax liens totaling $118,261 and one state tax lien in the amount of \n$5,585.1 Applicant admitted those allegations.2 In my Decision, I found that Applicant had \nmitigated the state tax lien under AG \u00b6 20(g) and the federal tax lien under AG \u00b6 20(b).3 \n1 SOR \u00b6 1. \n2 Answer \u00b6 1. \n3 Appeal Board at 2-3 (App. Bd.) \n04/02/2019\n\n2 \n \nThe Government appealed those findings. On appeal, the Board found that the ruling on \nthe state tax lien was based on harmless error, but the Board did not disagree that the \nstate tax lien had been mitigated under AG \u00b6 20(g).4  \n \nOn appeal, the Board ruled that the record evidence contradicted my Decision\u2019s \nfinding that Applicant had complied with the IRS\u2019s guidance to \u201ckeep up with current \ntaxes.\u201d The Board observed that Applicant had \u201cdelinquent business taxes for each \nquarter of 2016\u201d and was \u201ctwice delinquent\u201d on those taxes in 2017.5 Finally, the Board \nfound that it was error not to grant the Government\u2019s request under Federal Rule of \nEvidence 1006 for access to the data or documents underlying AE H, which was an Excel \nspreadsheet showing certain payments made by Applicant under an IRS installment \nagreement.6 The Board remanded the case to the Judge (1) to correct the identified \nerrors, (2) to reopen the record to allow the parties to present additional evidence and \narguments about Applicant\u2019s payment of back taxes, and (3) to issue a new decision in \naccordance with the Directive.7 \n \nStatement of the Case on Remand  \n \n          In light of the Appeal Board\u2019s Decision, on remand, first, I reopened the record on \nJanuary 11, 2019. Second, I ordered Applicant to produce the documents underlying AE \nH by January 25, 2019. Third, I allowed the parties to submit additional evidence on \nApplicant\u2019s payments (or lack thereof) of federal taxes. Finally, I directed the parties to \nsubmit written closing arguments: the Government by February 12, 2019, and Applicant \nby February 22, 2019.  \n \n         Applicant timely submitted documents which I marked as AE I and AE J. AE I is a \nseries of cancelled checks showing the total of $72,000 paid in 2014 under an installment \nagreement with the IRS ($6,000 monthly). Those are the documents underlying AE H. AE \nJ is a series of bank statements showing Applicant\u2019s monthly electronic payments of \nfederal payroll taxes. Those exhibits were admitted without objection.8 \n \n        The parties timely submitted written closing arguments.9  \n                                                          \n \n4 App. Bd. at 4.  \n \n5 App Bd. at 4.  \n \n6 App. Bd. at 5-6.  \n \n7 App. Bd. at 6-7.   \n \n8 I also marked as Hearing Exhibit 1 (HE 1) a series of emails among the parties and me from January 9, \n2019, through March 25, 2019. The Government did not submit any additional documents. Deputy Chief \nDepartment Counsel noted, however, that the Government has not asserted that Applicant failed to pay \nany payroll taxes. HE 1 email from Deputy Chief Department Counsel dated February 19, 2019. \n  \n9 The closing arguments of both parties were excellent pieces of written advocacy.  \n \n \n \n \n\n3 \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n           I incorporate herein by reference the findings of fact in my Decision and the  \nsummary of those findings by the Appeal Board.10 The two exhibits submitted on remand \nby Applicant do not change the original findings of fact.  \n \n      Discussion \n \n           The Government\u2019s principal factual basis for its arguments is that Applicant \nremains delinquent on federal quarterly business taxes for the following time periods: \nDecember 2010, March and June 2011, September 2011, September 2015, March 2016, \nJune 2016, September 2016, December 2016, March 2017, and June 2017. He remains \ndelinquent in unemployment taxes for December 2013 and December 2016. Applicant \nremains delinquent on federal corporate taxes for December 2016. In addition, the \nGovernment observes that Applicant\u2019s total outstanding federal tax debt at the time of his \ninstallment agreement was $109,230.11 \n \n \nWith that factual predicate, the Government argues in essence that Applicant\u2019s \ncontinued federal tax delinquencies, notwithstanding an installment agreement, do not \nestablish that he has reformed and rehabilitated his business practices sufficiently to \nprevent further tax delinquencies. The Government also points out that Applicant has \nconsistently underpaid his federal taxes from 2010 through 2017. The Government also \ncontends that there is not \u201ca cogent explanation showing a nexus\u201d between his wife\u2019s \nillness and the late customer invoice payments and Applicant\u2019s tax delinquencies. The \nGovernment argues, therefore, that AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant argues to the contrary that he has negotiated diligently with the IRS for \nseveral years (since 2013) to arrange installment payment agreements. It is also noted \nthat Applicant has, in fact, taken internal steps to prevent such delinquencies in the future. \nHis wife, who originally was to handle administrative tasks, has stepped away from day-\nto-day administration. Applicant will now take over those duties. Applicant has also hired \nan administrative assistant to aid in the handling of those duties. \n \n \nI have carefully weighed the parties\u2019 closing arguments. I disagree with the \nGovernment\u2019s contention that Applicant has not made meaningful adjustments to his \nbusiness practices. To begin with, the record showed that Applicant only belatedly \nbecame aware that his wife had been unable to keep up with administrative duties due to \nher illness. When he learned of that issue, Applicant immediately took on the \nadministrative duties himself. He also began negotiating with state and federal tax \nauthorities, reaching installment agreements with both of them. He put his clients on strict \n                                                          \n10 Decision at 2-5; App. Bd. at 2. \n  \n11 Government Brief (which is not paginated) notes 23-28 citing AE D at 9 and AE E. \n\n4 \n \npayment schedules. And his wife stepped away from daily administrative duties, in favor \nof a newly hired administrative assistant.12 \n \n \nI also disagree with the Government that there is an insufficient nexus between \nApplicant\u2019s tax delinquencies and his wife\u2019s illness. Having observed Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony, it is clear that his wife\u2019s illness was only belatedly discovered by him and was \nserious enough for his wife ultimately to require surgery. He thus lost his 60% partner\u2019s \nparticipation in the business of a two-member LLC. This was a condition largely beyond \nApplicant\u2019s control. The first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. \n \n \nThe open question is whether Applicant\u2019s modifications to his business tax \npractices have been responsible. The Government\u2019s strongest evidence on this point is \nthat Applicant has consistently underpaid his federal taxes from 2010 through 2017, \nnotwithstanding installment agreements. In the vernacular, the Government\u2019s position is \nthat what Applicant did was \u201ctoo little, too late.\u201d Or as the old saying goes, \u201cthe proof is in \nthe pudding,\u201d and Applicant\u2019s persistent tax delinquencies are evidence that Applicant\u2019s \nbusiness reforms have not proven to be sufficient. In short, the Government contends \nthat Applicant has not acted responsibly under AG \u00b6 20(b). I agree. The Appeal Board \nfound error in my conclusion that Applicant had complied with the IRS guidance that he \n\u201ckeep up with current taxes.\u201d13 Neither of Applicant\u2019s two exhibits submitted on remand \ngive me a factual basis to find that Applicant has kept current with his taxes.14   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):      Against Applicant \n \n \n     Subparagraph 1.a: \n \n \n \n \n    For Applicant \n \n \n     Subparagraphs 1.b-c:   \n \n \n    \n    Against Applicant \n \n \n \n____________________ \nPhilip J.

(Government Exhibit 1.) On October 18, 2017, the \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guidelines \nF (Financial Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \n \n \n1 \n \n \n\n \n \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility \nfor Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, effective \nwithin the Department of Defense on June 8, 2017. \n  \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on January 9, 2018, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared \nto proceed on January 31, 2018. The case was assigned to me on February 6, 2018. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on March 9, \n2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled on May 1, 2018. The Government offered \nGovernment Exhibits 1 through 5, which were admitted without objection. Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on May 9, \n2018.  \n  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 34-year-old Technician II. He is divorced with one child, and has an \nAssociate of Arts degree. He is seeking to retain a security clearance in connection with \nhis work with the DoD.  \n \nApplicant served on active duty with the Navy from November 2003 through \nNovember 2007, when he obtained an Honorable Discharge. He has had several periods \nof unemployment between November 2007 and June 2015, when he began work with his \ncurrent employer. The longest period of unemployment was between May 2010 and \nAugust 2013. During that period Applicant went to college and supported himself with the \nGI Bill. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 13A and 15.) \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations) \n \n \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has a history of past-due indebtedness that can raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing all nine debts set forth in the SOR (subparagraphs 1.a \nthrough 1.i), with qualifications and explanations. The total amount of money Applicant is \nalleged to owe is approximately $23,094. The existence and amount of the debts are \ndocumented by credit reports dated March 2, 2016; September 5, 2017; and April 30, \n2018. (Government Exhibits 4, 3, and 5.) (See Government Exhibit 2.)  \n \n \nThe current status of the debts is as follows: \n \n \n1.a. Applicant admitted owing $5,121 for a past-due student loan debt. Applicant \nhad not made any recent payments on this debt and did not have a plan to pay this debt \nin the near future. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. 44-48.) \n \n2 \n \n\n \n \n \n1.b. Applicant admitted owing $3,578 for a second past-due student loan debt. \nApplicant had not made any recent payments on this debt and did not have a plan to pay \nthis debt in the near future. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. 44-48.) \n \n \n1.c. Applicant admitted owing a past-due debt to a cable company, however he \ndenied owing $1,257. He stated that this debt was allegedly for equipment he had not \nreturned, when in fact he had returned it. Applicant further stated that he had attempted \nto dispute the account with the creditor, but his testimony was unclear on this point. He \nfurther stated, \u201cI will be addressing this one [debt] in the very near future.\u201d No further \ninformation was provided. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. 49-51.) \n \n \n1.d. Applicant admitted owing $1,012 for a past-due wireless telephone debt. \nApplicant had not made any recent payments on this debt and did not have a plan to pay \nthis debt in the near future. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. 52-54.) \n \n \n1.e. Applicant admitted owing $351 for a past-due debt to a credit union. Applicant \nhad not made any recent payments on this debt and did not have a plan to pay this debt \nin the near future. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. 54-55.) \n \n \n1.f. Applicant admitted owing $264 for a past-due telephone debt. Applicant had \nnot made any recent payments on this debt and did not have a plan to pay this debt in \nthe near future. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. 52, 55.) \n \n \n1.g. Applicant admitted owing $5,000 for a judgment entered against him in \nFebruary 2011 for past-due home owners\u2019 association fees. Applicant had no information \nas to whether this judgment had been resolved. Once again, his testimony was unclear \non this point. He had not made any recent payments on this debt and did not have a plan \nto pay this debt in the near future. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. 55-57.) \n \n \n1.h. Applicant admitted owing $235 for a past-due gym membership debt. \nApplicant had not made any recent payments on this debt and did not have a plan to pay \nthis debt in the near future. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. 57-58.) \n \n \n1.i. Applicant admitted owing $6,276 for a past-due bank credit card debt. Applicant \nhad not made any recent payments on this debt and did not have a plan to pay this debt \nin the near future. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. 59-61.) \n \n \nAs stated, after Applicant left the Navy he had several periods of unemployment. \nThis had some impact on his ability to pay his bills. However, Applicant admitted that part \nof the problem was poor financial planning, decision making, and budgeting on his part. \nHe had been employed by his current company for almost three years as of the date of \nthe hearing and had not made any payments towards any of his past-due debts. (Tr. 30-\n36, 39-40, 42-43.) \n \n \n3 \n \n\n \nApplicant stated, and the credit reports support, that he had not acquired any new \ndelinquent debt. He testified that he hoped to pay his past-due debts off over the next five \nyears. However, he had not made any specific plan to pay off his past-due indebtedness. \n(Tr. 20, 48, 61-63, 74.) \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct) \n \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has engaged in conduct that shows poor judgment, untrustworthiness or \nunreliability. Applicant admitted both the allegations under this paragraph, with \nqualifications.  \n \nApplicant filled out an e-QIP on February 22, 2016. (Government Exhibit 1.) \nSection 26 of that questionnaire concerned Applicant\u2019s financial record. Both allegations \nin the SOR concern different questions from this section. \n \n 2.a. Appellant was asked in Section 26 whether, in the past seven years, he had \na judgment entered against him. Appellant answered this question, \u201cNo.\u201d In fact, as stated \nabove, Applicant had a judgment entered against him in 2011, five years before his filling \nout the e-QIP, in the amount of $5,000. This was a false answer to a relevant question \nconcerning Appellant\u2019s financial situation.  \n \nApplicant testified that he did not talk about the judgment because he thought it \nhad occurred more than seven years before he filled out the questionnaire. Appellant\u2019s \nexplanation is not unreasonable as to this question. Subparagraph 2.a is found for \nApplicant. (Tr. 68-71.) (See Answer.) \n \n2.b Section 26 goes on to ask Applicant if, in the seven years before the date he \nfilled out the questionnaire, he had bills or debts turned over to a collection agency, or \nhad an account charged off for failing to pay as agreed? Applicant answered both \nquestions, \u201cNo.\u201d These were false answers to relevant questions about his financial \nstatus.  \n \nApplicant testified that he did not intend to falsify the questionnaire, but he was not \nreally \u201con top of it\u201d with regard to his debts. Applicant\u2019s testimony as to his reasons for \nleaving his debts off of the questionnaire was often vague, unclear, or contradictory. (Tr. \n71-78.) Subparagraph 2.b is found against Applicant. \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \n4\n\n \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n \n \n\n \nAnalysis \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations)  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant, based on the evidence, had nine delinquent accounts that he could not \nor chose not to resolve. These debts have been in existence for a considerable period of \ntime. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions. \n \n \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n6 \n \n \n\n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nThe evidence does not establish that any of the above mitigating conditions apply \nto Applicant. With regard to AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant was unemployed between 2010 and \n2013. However, he was going to school during that time and was supporting himself with \nthe GI Bill. In addition, he had been employed just short of three years as of the time of \nthe hearing and had not paid any of the past-due debts. He failed to submit evidence that \nwould tend to support any of the other mitigating conditions. There is no basis for me to \nfind that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns of his financial situation. Paragraph \n1 is found against Applicant. \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct) \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \n \n \n \n \n7 \n \n \n\n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. One is potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \n \n \nApplicant knowingly falsified material facts about his financial situation on a \nGovernment personnel security questionnaire in 2016. None of the potentially mitigating \nconditions under this guideline apply to his conduct in this case with regard to that \nquestionnaire. Paragraph 2 is found against Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant=s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.    \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not mitigated his \nsignificant financial difficulties, or his falsifications to the Government concerning his \nfinancial situation. Overall, the record evidence does create substantial doubt as to \nApplicant=s present suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8 \n \n \n\n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by & E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant=s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n__________ \nDecision \n__________ \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to timely file her federal and state income tax returns for tax \nyears 2012 through 2015. Her recent income tax return filings are insufficient to \nestablish a track record of financial responsibility. She failed to demonstrate good \njudgment, reliability, and willingness to comply with the law. The financial considerations \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on May 15, 2016, \nseeking the continuation of her clearance eligibility required for her position with a \nfederal contractor. After reviewing the information gathered during the background \ninvestigation, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \non October 26, 2017, alleging security concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). Applicant answered the SOR on June 21, 2018, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA). \nDOHA assigned the case to me on September 12, 2018, and issued a notice of \nhearing on November 6, 2018, setting the hearing for December 19, 2018. Applicant \n03/20/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nrequested a delay due to health problems on December 18, 2018. I rescheduled the \nhearing for January 11, 2019. At the hearing, the Government offered seven exhibits \n(GE 1 through 7). Applicant objected to GE 3 - an unauthenticated summary of her \ninterview with a background investigator, and I excluded the document. GE 3 was made \npart of the record, but it was not considered as evidence. Applicant testified and \nsubmitted 10 exhibits (AE 1 through 10). AE 10 was received post-hearing. All exhibits \nwere admitted without objection, except for GE 3, as noted above. DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on January 23, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted that she failed to timely file her federal and state income tax \nreturns for tax years 2012 through 2015. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) She denied the remaining seven \nSOR allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.h), claiming that she had either paid or disputed \nthem. Her SOR admission, and those at the hearing, are incorporated herein as findings \nof fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact: \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She received an \nassociate\u2019s degree in 2003, and has completed several technical certifications \nthereafter. She married in 2002 and divorced in 2006. She has two children, ages 16 \nand 4. She receives $1,800 a month in child support. \n \nApplicant has worked for many federal contractors from 2004 to present, except \nfor a short period of unemployment between July 2008 and August 2008. She also was \nlaid off in October 2015, and worked as an independent contractor for federal \ncontractors between October 2015 and May 2016. She received eligibility for a secret \nclearance in 2006, which has been continued to present without any issues or concerns, \nexcept for those in the SOR. Her current employer hired Applicant in May 2016.  \n \nIn her response to Section 26 (Financial Record) of her 2016 SCA, Applicant \ndisclosed financial problems, which included her failure to timely file her federal and \nstate tax returns for tax years 2012 through 2014, a state tax lien filed against her for \nher 2012 unpaid taxes, and several medical and consumer accounts that were \ndelinquent or in collection.  \n \nApplicant failed to timely file her federal and state income tax returns for tax \nyears 2012 through 2017. Specifically, she filed her 2012 and 2013 income tax returns \nin 2017; and filed her federal and state 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 income tax returns \nin 2019. According to her income tax returns, Applicant owes $3,217 in taxes for tax \nyear 2012. The IRS denied her refund of $1,755 for tax year 2013 because she filed \nmore than three years late. She owed no taxes for tax year 2014, but she owed $573 for \ntax year 2015. For tax year 2016, she owed $11,314 in taxes; and she owed no taxes \nfor tax year 2017. (See AEs 1, 2, 3, 10(a) and 10(b), and documents submitted with her \nSOR answer.)  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant testified that she agreed with her state tax authorities to pay $350 a \nmonth until the state determines her balance. Any overpayments she makes will be \nrefunded. She is waiting for the IRS to provide her with a final balance.  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.f alleged debts in collection for telecommunications providers. \nApplicant disputed both accounts, but then paid SOR \u00b6 1.f in January 2019. (AE 6) The \nremaining SOR allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.e, 1.g, and 1.h) alleged small medical \ndebts, likely for unpaid insurance co-payments. Applicant paid SOR \u00b6 1.h in April 2018. \n(AE 8) She testified that she either paid or disputed the remaining debts because she \ncould not identify the creditor. Considering the evidence as a whole, I resolve SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b through 1.h for Applicant. \n \nApplicant testified that she prepared and filed all her income tax returns before \n2012. She failed to file her 2012 tax return because of complications resulting from \nmultiple states assessing income taxes against her. She was a stay-at-home employee \nwith work connections to three different states. She did not know how to file her tax \nreturns and procrastinated doing so. (Tr. 72) Applicant visited an IRS office in 2017, and \nthey advised her they were not interested in her 2012 income tax returns, but on her \nmore recent delinquent returns. She retained an accountant to help her file her \ndelinquent income tax returns in 2017. \n \nConcerning her failure to timely file her 2013, 2014, and 2015 income tax returns, \nApplicant stated that she was under the mistaken belief that if she paid her taxes up-\nfront (by automatic pay deductions), she would not have any problems if she were to file \nher income tax returns late. She noted that after her uncle, an attorney, corrected her \nmistaken belief, she has been making every effort to file her income tax returns as soon \nas possible. Applicant believes that she has been open and forthcoming during the \nclearance process about not filing her tax returns. She testified that she takes her duties \nand clearance responsibilities seriously. \n \nThe filing of Applicant\u2019s income tax return for year 2016 was complicated \nbecause she was working as an independent contractor and was missing documents \n(bank statements and information from her business accounts). Her business failed \nwhen she got sick in 2017, and she claimed not having access to her business records \nand accounts.  \n \nApplicant noted that her efforts to file her delinquent income taxes were \nhampered by her recent medical problems. In about September 2017, she was \ndiagnosed with Cushing\u2019s disease. The day before her operation for Cushing\u2019s disease, \nshe was diagnosed also with breast cancer. As a result, she underwent two operations \nand was incapacitated and unable to work for about seven months. During that period, \nshe was unable to make any progress filing her delinquent tax returns. \n \nApplicant expressed sincere remorse for not filing her income tax returns on time. \nShe claimed that she has learned a hard lesson and promised to timely file her income \ntax returns and to pay her taxes in the future. She is very concerned about losing her \n\n \n4 \n \n \nclearance and her job because she is the sole provider for her children and she has \nserious ongoing medical problems. Applicant\u2019s 2016 income tax returns shows that her \nincome was $64,587; and for tax year 2017 her income was $84,657. (AE 10(b), AE 3) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; and DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(Directive) (January 2, 1992), as amended. The case will be adjudicated under the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all \nadjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017.  \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered.  \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \n\n \n5 \n \n \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems is documented in the record. She failed \nto timely file her federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2012 through 2015. \nAdditionally, she had seven delinquent or collection accounts. AG \u00b6 19 provides \ndisqualifying conditions that raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this \ncase: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; \nand \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d The \nrecord established the disqualifying conditions, requiring additional inquiry about the \npossible applicability of mitigating conditions.  \n \nSix mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n\n \n6 \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2013).  \n \n \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, I find that none of the mitigating conditions \nare sufficiently raised by the evidence and are not applicable. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not \napply because Applicant failed to timely file her taxes for five consecutive years and she \nfinished filing her 2012 and 2016 delinquent tax returns after her clearance hearing. I \nfind her behavior was frequent and recent.  \n \n \nApplicant failed to file income tax returns because some returns were \ncomplicated, her procrastination, her negligence seeking professional tax assistance, \nand her mistaken belief that if she paid any taxes due up-front she did not have to file \nher returns. She averred that she failed to file her returns any sooner because she was \nhampered by her recent medical problems. I note that she was not diagnosed with \nCushing\u2019s disease until September 2017. She presented no evidence of any medical \nproblems before September 2017 that could have prevented her from filing her income \ntax returns.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nGiving due consideration to Applicant\u2019s difficulties and challenging life events, I \nfind that she failed to demonstrate financial responsibility under the circumstances. She \nfailed to provide convincing evidence of efforts to timely file her federal and state \nincome tax returns when they were due. Applicant\u2019s efforts to file her delinquent income \ntax returns did not start until after she received the October 2017 SOR. I give Applicant \ncredit for her recent efforts to file her late income tax returns and to pay her delinquent \nstate taxes.  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged that her failure to timely file her federal and state income \ntax returns resulted primarily from her lack of diligence. She neglected her legal \nobligation to timely file her income tax returns over an extended period. \u201cFailure to \ncomply with federal and state tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding to well-established Government rules and regulations. Voluntary compliance \nwith rules and regulations is essential for protecting classified information.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). This is true even if the returns have been \nfiled. See ISCR Case No. 15-03481 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 27, 2016).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s repeated failure to file her federal and state income tax returns in a \ntimely manner does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability \nrequired of persons granted access to classified information. See, ISCR Case No. 14-\n01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 27, 2016). In sum, Applicant failed to demonstrate financial \nresponsibility. The financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of \nthese factors were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \nApplicant, 41, has been employed with federal contractors since 2004, and has \nheld a clearance since 2006. Because of her 13 years holding a clearance and working \nfor federal contractors, Applicant was aware she was required to maintain her financial \nresponsibility to be eligible for a clearance. She failed to demonstrate good judgment \nand reliability. Her failure to timely file her tax returns for six consecutive years shows \nthat she has a problem complying with well-established government rules. At this time, \nher evidence is insufficient to establish a track record of financial responsibility. \n \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot \nor will not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the \nfuture. With more effort towards documented resolution of her delinquent taxes and \nother delinquent debts, a healthy financial picture, and a track record of behavior \nconsistent with her obligations, she may well be able to demonstrate persuasive \nevidence of her security clearance worthiness.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.b - 1.h:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

She has one adult son. She has been employed by a company managing health care for DOD since 1999. (Item 4, e-QIP, dated February 5, 2016; Item 5, PSI, dated October 18, 2016) The SOR alleges and credit reports (Item 6, dated February 17, 2016; Item 7, dated March 22, 2017; Item 8, dated January 11, 2018) confirm the following six delinquent debts: a student loan in collection for $22,048 (SOR 1.a); a charge account in collection past due for $221, on a total balance of $1,334 (SOR 1.b); a credit card account in collection for $1,300 (SOR 1.c); another credit card debt in collection for $1,299 (SOR 1.d); a cable debt in collection for $365 (SOR 1.e); and a television 3 service debt in collection for $146 (SOR 1.f). In her response to the SOR, Applicant provided sufficient documentation to establish that she paid the two debts totaling $511 at SOR 1.e and 1.f. The total amount of the debt she admitted for the remaining four debts is $24,868 with the student loan debt at SOR 1.a, accounting for over 85% of the debt.

She presented sufficient information to mitigate alcohol \nconsumption trustworthiness concerns. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn February 5, 2016, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain eligibility for a public trust position to work \nfor a defense contractor. (Item 4) Applicant was interviewed by an agent from the Office \nof Personnel Management (OPM) on October 18, 2016, December 5, 2016, and May \n27, 2017. (Item 5, Summary of Personal Subject Interview (PSI)) After reviewing the \nresults of the background investigation, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudication Facility (DOD CAF) could not make the affirmative findings required to \ngrant Applicant access to sensitive information.  \n \n   12/07/2018\n\n2 \n \nOn October 23, 2017, the DOD CAF issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) for financial and alcohol trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F and \nGuideline G. DOD took the action under DOD Manual 5200.02, Procedures for the DOD \nPersonnel Security Program (PSP), and the adjudicative guidelines effective on June 8, \n2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 20, 2017 (Item 2). She admitted four \nand denied two of the six allegations of financial trustworthiness concern. Under alcohol \nconsumption, Applicant admitted that she was treated for an alcohol-induced liver \ndisorder in 2015 and was advised by her doctor not to continue to consume alcohol. \nShe denies the allegation that she continues to consume alcohol in spite of her doctor\u2019s \nrecommendation. Applicant requested a decision on the record.  \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on February 12, \n2018. (Item 10). Applicant received a complete file of relevant material (FORM) on May \n23, 2018, and was provided the opportunity to file objections and submit material to \nrefute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions. (Item 11) Applicant provided \nadditional information in response to the FORM on June 6, 2018. (Item 12) On October \n22, 2018, Department Counsel noted that she had no objection to consideration of the \nadditional material. (Item 13) I was assigned the case on July 26, 2018. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nApplicant was advised in the FORM that the summary of the PSI (Item 5) was not \nauthenticated and could not be considered over her objection. She was further advised \nthat she could make any corrections, additions, or deletions to the summary to make it \nclear and accurate, and could object to the admission of the summary as not \nauthenticated by a Government witness. She was additionally advised that if no \nobjection was raised to the summary, the Administrative Judge could determine that she \nwaived any objection to the admissibility of the PSI summary. Applicant did not raise \nany objection to consideration of the PSI when she responded to the FORM. Since \nthere is no objection by Applicant, I will consider information in the PSI in my decision. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 55 years old. She married in 1981, but her husband passed away in 1993. \nShe has one adult son. She has been employed by a company managing health care \nfor DOD since 1999. (Item 4, e-QIP, dated February 5, 2016; Item 5, PSI, dated October \n18, 2016)  \n \nThe SOR alleges and credit reports (Item 6, dated February 17, 2016; Item 7, \ndated March 22, 2017; Item 8, dated January 11, 2018) confirm the following six \ndelinquent debts: a student loan in collection for $22,048 (SOR 1.a); a charge account \nin collection past due for $221, on a total balance of $1,334 (SOR 1.b); a credit card \naccount in collection for $1,300 (SOR 1.c); another credit card debt in collection for \n$1,299 (SOR 1.d); a cable debt in collection for $365 (SOR 1.e); and a television \n\n3 \n \nservice debt in collection for $146 (SOR 1.f). In her response to the SOR, Applicant \nprovided sufficient documentation to establish that she paid the two debts totaling $511 \nat SOR 1.e and 1.f. The total amount of the debt she admitted for the remaining four \ndebts is $24,868 with the student loan debt at SOR 1.a, accounting for over 85% of the \ndebt.  \n \n \nThe alcohol consumption trustworthiness concern alleges that in December \n2015, Applicant received medical treatment for an alcohol induced liver disorder \ndiagnosed as alcohol abuse. (SOR 2.a) It was further alleged that Applicant continued \nto consume alcohol notwithstanding her doctor recommending that she abstain from \nalcohol consumption. (SOR 2.b)  \n \n \nApplicant reported the student loan debt on her e-QIP. In the PSI, Applicant \nnoted that the student loan dates from her schooling in 1981. Since then, she had her \npay garnished and made other payments on the debt until early 2010. She provided no \ndocuments to verify her assertions. She has not made any payments on the student \nloans since the account went delinquent in January 2010. In her response to the FORM, \nApplicant attached a request, dated May 18, 2018, that she submitted to have her \nstudent loan account deferred because of economic hardship. She has not received a \nresponse to her request.  \n \nIn the PSI, Applicant also reported that she had a bank credit card account in \ncollection. She stated that she opened the account in 2011 and used it to charge over \n$1,000 in general purchases. She does not recall the balance and the date when the \ncard went into default. There are two debts listed in the SOR that could relate to this \naccount. Both are with the same creditor and for the approximate amount Applicant \nreported as the amount she charged on the credit card. While Applicant did not claim \nthat the debts are duplicates, I find from the information on the credit reports that the \ndebts at SOR 1.c and 1.d are duplications. Accordingly, I find for Applicant as to \nallegation 1.d. Applicant stated that she would contact creditors and make payments as \nsoon as she could. Applicant did not present any additional information on any \npayments made on this debt.  \n \nAt the PSI, Applicant discussed some other SOR debts. She knew some debts \nwere charged off. She did not know she had to make payments on charged off \naccounts. She also reported that her present financial situation is fair and she is current \npaying her bills. She lives within her means and intends to pay her debt when she is \nable. She has not received financial counseling or used a debt consolidation service. \n(Item 5) \n \nIn her response to the FORM (Item 13), Applicant noted that she has no \ndelinquent utility accounts. She further noted that her financial issues happened a long \ntime ago, are unlikely to recur, and are being actively resolved. The only document \nApplicant presented in her response to the FORM was a May 18, 2018 request for \ndeferment of the student loans for economic hardship reasons. (Item 12) \n \n\n4 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s medical records show that she reported moderate to heavy alcohol \nuse to her doctor in 2015 and 2016. In December 2015, Applicant was advised by her \ndoctor to seek alcohol counseling and treatment because of elevated liver enzymes. \n(Item 9 at 92) She voluntarily received treatment for three days in December 2015. \n(Item 9 at 67) Applicant was diagnosed with chronic alcohol abuse and alcohol-induced \nliver disorder, and was advised of the importance of discontinuing alcohol use. (Item 9 \nat 88) The medical records do not contain a clear statement from Applicant\u2019s doctor that \nshe should not consume alcohol. In May 2017 during a physical examination, Applicant \nreported her consumption of alcohol as an occasional glass of wine. There were no \nreported alcohol-related incidents either at work or away from work. \n \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant presented a letter from her doctor stating \nthat there is no indication in her medical records to suggest that she is not capable of \nperforming her present duties. The letter notes that she has sound judgment and no \nissues concerning substance abuse. (Exhibit C, Response to SOR) In her FORM \nresponse, Applicant emphasized that her alcohol consumption problems have been \nresolved, and she abstinent from alcohol consumption. \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive information] will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and \nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or \nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable trustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \n\n5 \n \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThere is a trustworthiness concern for a failure or inability to live within one=s \nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations, and may indicate poor self-control, \nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulation, raising questions \nabout an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect sensitive \ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18). Similarly, an \nindividual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or \ncareless in their obligation to protect sensitive information. Behaving responsibly or \nirresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in \nother aspects of life. \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a position of trust. An applicant is not required to be debt \nfree, but is required to manage her finances in such a way as to meet her financial \nobligations.  \n \n \nAdverse information in credit reports can normally meet the substantial evidence \nstandard to establish financial delinquency. Applicant has significant unresolved student \nloan and consumer debts. Her delinquent debts are established by credit reports and \nher admissions in the e-QIP and her response to the SOR. The debts pose a \ntrustworthiness concern raising Financial Consideration Disqualifying Conditions under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nI considered the following Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG 20:  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n\n6 \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparations) \nand \nthe \nindividual \nacted \nresponsibly \nunder \nthe \ncircumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and \n \n(d) the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay the overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nThese mitigating conditions do not apply. Applicant incurred student loan debt \ndeliberately and freely to finance her education. She also deliberately, freely, and \nindiscriminately used consumer credit cards to purchase items. The financing of her \neducation through student loans and use of credit cards are not unusual circumstances \nor beyond Applicant\u2019s control. Applicant\u2019s debts are numerous, have not been resolved \nso they are recent, and they were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence \nunlikely. \n \n \nApplicant presented evidence that she resolved two small consumer debts for \ntelevision and cable service. Her student loans date from 1981, and went delinquent in \n2010. She presented a May 2018 request for deferment of the student loans for \nfinancial hardship reasons. The submission of a request for deferment over eight years \nafter a debt became delinquent is not acting responsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant did not present any evidence of her efforts to address and resolve her \ndelinquent credit card debts. She stated in 2016 that she would contact the creditors. \nTwo years later, she did not present any information of any arrangements, plans, or \npayments to the creditors.  \n \nGood faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty and obligation. Applicant is not required to be debt-free. \nAll that is required is that Applicant act responsibly given her financial circumstances. \nApplicant must establish that she has a reasonable plan to resolve financial problems, \nand that she has taken significant action to implement that plan. Applicant\u2019s plan must \nshow a systematic method of handling debts, and meaningful track record of debt \npayment. A meaningful track record of debt payment can be established by evidence of \nactual debt payments. A promise to pay delinquent debts is not a substitute for a track \nrecord of paying debts in a timely manner and acting in a financially responsible \nmanner. Applicant only presented evidence of the payment of two small debts.  \n \n \nApplicant did not provide sufficient details about what she plans to do to address \nthe remaining debts alleged in the SOR. She did not state that she had a plan to pay \nher debts. She did not provide documentation to show proof of payments, \ncorrespondence to or from the creditors to establish maintenance of contact, copies of \ndebt disputes, evidence of attempts to negotiate payment plans, or other evidence of \n\n7 \n \ndebt resolution. She only presented a document requesting deferment of her student \nloans sent eight years after the loans went into default. There is insufficient evidence to \nestablish why Applicant was unable to make any progress resolving his debts. There is \ninsufficient assurance that her financial problems are being resolved, are under control, \nand will not recur in the future.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to establish payment of or a plan to pay her SOR debts \nstudent loan and credit card debts shows that she has not acted reasonably and \nhonestly with regard to her financial duties and obligations. She is not managing her \npersonal financial obligations responsibly. Her lack of reasonable and responsible \nactions toward her finances is a strong indication that she will not protect and safeguard \nsensitive information. Based on all of the financial information, I conclude that Applicant \nhas not mitigated trustworthiness concerns based on financial considerations. \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption is a trustworthiness concern because it often \nleads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. (AG \u00b6 21)  \n \nApplicant was treated for excessive alcohol consumption in December 2015 and \nadvised by her doctor not to consume alcohol. There are no reported alcohol-related \nincidents. Available evidence shows Applicant continues to consume moderate levels of \nalcohol. This information is sufficient to establish the following Alcohol Consumption \nDisqualifying Condition under AG \u00b6 22: \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g. physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder;  \n \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \n \n \nAvailable evidence shows that Applicant was treated for an alcohol-related \nmedical problem in December 2015. She was advised of the importance of \ndiscontinuing alcohol use. The file does not contain information concerning Applicant\u2019s \ntreatment for any other alcohol-related problem. The file contains information that \nApplicant continued to consume some level of alcohol.  \n \nI considered the following Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 \n23: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \n\n8 \n \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of action taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations;  \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations.  \n \nWhile there is no \"bright line\" rule for determining when conduct is recent or \nsufficient time has passed since the incidents, a determination whether past conduct \naffects an individual's present reliability and trustworthiness must be based on a careful \nevaluation of the totality of the evidence. If the evidence shows a significant period of \ntime has passed without evidence of an alcohol issue, there must be an evaluation \nwhether that period of time demonstrates changed circumstances or conduct sufficient \nto indicate a finding of reform or rehabilitation.  \n \n \nApplicant presented evidence to establish that she does not have an alcohol-\nrelated issue. There is no evidence in Applicant\u2019s medical records that she was advised \nnot to consume alcohol. There is evidence that she was advised of the importance of \ndiscontinuing alcohol use because of her medical condition. While she admits that she \ncontinues to consume some level of alcohol, she presented information from her doctor \nthat she is capable of performing her current job, has sound judgment, and no issue \nwith substance abuse. Accordingly, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to show a \nchange of circumstances. She established that she is controlling her alcohol \nconsumption impulses. If she had an alcohol-related issue, she has shown that she has \nbeen reformed or rehabilitated. I find that Applicant mitigated trustworthiness concerns \nfor alcohol consumption. \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s trustworthiness eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n9 \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a trustworthiness \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s \napproximately 20 years of service to a defense contractor managing sensitive medical \ninformation. However, Applicant did not provide sufficient credible documentary \ninformation to establish that she took or plans to take reasonable and responsible action \nto resolve her financial obligations. In requesting an administrative determination, \nApplicant chose to rely on the written record. In doing so, she must sufficiently \nsupplement the record with relevant and material facts regarding her finances, \nadequately articulate her actions and positions, and provide facts to mitigate the \ntrustworthiness concerns. Applicant is required to show that she has a credible and \nreasonable plan to resolve her financial problems and that she has taken significant \naction to implement that plan. Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence of her plans. \n \nIn short, the file as a whole does not contain sufficient information to mitigate \nfinancial trustworthiness concerns. Applicant did not establish a reasonable plan to \nresolve her delinquent debts. She did not show that she took sufficient actions to \nimplement the plan, and she did not establish that she is managing her financial \nobligations within her resources. However, Applicant established that she does not have \nan alcohol consumption trustworthiness concern. Overall, Applicant has not established \nthat she can be trusted to manage sensitive information. The record evidence leaves \nme with questions and doubts pertaining to Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and her eligibility and suitability for a position of trust. For all these \nreasons, Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position is denied. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d \u2013 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n10 \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.

Stephens, Esq. \n07/31/2019 \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHESS, Stephanie C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns raised by his history of alcohol \nconsumption and alcohol-related charges and arrests. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on May 11, 2016. On \nMarch 7, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), alleging security concerns under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct). The DOD acted under Executive Order (Ex. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nimplemented by DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n  \nApplicant submitted his Answer to the SOR on March 16, 2018, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on \n\n \n \n2\nJune 20, 2018, and the case was assigned to me on January 30, 2019. On April 3, 2019, \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing \nwas scheduled for April 24. 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government \nExhibits (GX) 1 through 5 were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified, called two witnesses, and offered Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through H, which \nwere admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on May 6, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nUnder Guideline G, the SOR alleges that Applicant was arrested and charged with \npublic intoxication in 2004, and driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) in 2008, twice \nin 2013, and in 2015. This conduct is cross-alleged under Guideline E. Applicant admits \neach of the allegations under Guideline G, but denies the allegations under Guideline E, \nstating that he does not think Guideline E is applicable. Applicant\u2019s admissions are \nincorporated in my findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old project manager employed by a defense contractor since \nMay 2012. He received his bachelor\u2019s degree in 2012. He has held a security clearance \nsince 2013. (GX 1.)  \n \nApplicant began drinking alcohol when he was 15 years old. In March 2004, \nApplicant was walking home in a college town when the police noticed that he was \nstaggering and arrested him, charging him with public intoxication. He paid a $2,000 fine \nand was released.  \n \nIn December 2008, after attending several Christmas parties with his cousin, \nApplicant was pulled over and arrested and charged with DUI. His license was suspended \nfor six months, he was fined, and he was required to take an alcohol education course.  \n \nIn August 2013, Applicant was at a bachelor party in another town. He left the party \nto go purchase more beer, and was stopped for a broken tail light. The officer suspected \nthat Applicant was driving under the influence of alcohol, but Applicant would not submit \nto a breathalyzer. Applicant was arrested under the suspicion of DUI. He pled guilty, \nserved one year probation, and attended DUI awareness classes.  \n \nIn November 2013, Applicant was driving to the airport at approximately 2:00 a.m. \nwhen he was stopped at an alcohol checkpoint. The officer claimed that he smelled \nalcohol on Applicant. Applicant told the officer that he had not been drinking and \nrequested a field sobriety test. The officer refused, and upon discovering that Applicant \nwas driving on a suspended license, the officer arrested Applicant. He was released \napproximately 90 minutes after the arrest. Applicant appeared in court and the DUI and \ndriving on suspended charges were both dismissed.   \n \nIn December 2015, after recently returning from working in Asia, Applicant \nattended a company party, where he consumed several beers. On his way home, \nApplicant took a wrong turn and ultimately ran out of gas. He fell asleep in his car, and \n\n \n \n3\nsomeone notified the police. The police arrived, awoke Applicant, who appeared \ndisoriented, and required him to perform field sobriety tests. Applicant failed the tests and \nwas arrested and charged with DUI. In June 2016, Applicant pled guilty, was sentenced \nto 48 hours in jail, his license was suspended, and he was required to install a vehicle \ninterlock system. Applicant was also required to attend 12 hours of alcohol awareness \ntraining and was placed on one year probation. \n \n \nApplicant timely reported the 2015 and 2013 charges to his facility security officer \n(FSO). Following his 2015 DUI arrest, Applicant became concerned about his use of \nalcohol and the resulting consequences. In July 2016, Applicant voluntarily sought an \nalcohol evaluation and treatment with a psychiatrist. Applicant reported to the psychiatrist \nthat he began abusing drugs, including cocaine and Xanax, when he was 16 years old. \nIn 2000, when Applicant was 21 years old, he awoke in the hospital following an apparent \noverdose. Applicant voluntarily entered an inpatient rehabilitation facility for three months \nand participated in outpatient treatment for nine months for cocaine and prescription drug \naddiction. Following his successful completion of treatment, Applicant was drug-free until \n2002, when he relapsed for one night. He has not used any cocaine or other illegal drugs \nor misused any prescription drugs since that time. (AX A; GX 5; GX 1.) \n \n \nThe psychiatrist evaluated Applicant and determined that he had an alcohol use \ndisorder with a history of stimulant and sedative dependence use disorder that was \npresently in remission. The psychiatrist\u2019s recommended treatment was for Applicant to \nrefamiliarize himself with the treatment model he learned from his previous drug \nrehabilitation, limit his alcohol use, and use diversion techniques, such as exercise and \ndating. Additionally, the treatment plan requires Applicant to meet with the psychiatrist at \nleast annually, and to maintain telephonic contact periodically. Further, Applicant was \nrequired to agree to permit the psychiatrist to maintain contact with Applicant\u2019s brother \nwho reports his observations of Applicant\u2019s overall behavior and specifically alcohol use \nto the psychiatrist. (AX A.) \n \n \nApplicant met with the psychiatrist in March 2018. As a result of that meeting, the \npsychiatrist produced a written report which includes a summary of Applicant\u2019s personal \nhistory, his drug rehabilitation treatment, his DUIs, and references their July 2016 and \nJune 2017 sessions. The report states that Applicant acknowledges his previous pattern \nof maladaptive alcohol use, has taken positive actions to overcome his problem, and has \ncomplied with the requirements of his treatment. (AX A.) The psychiatrist testified that \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol use disorder has been in remission since 2016, and that his prognosis \nis good. (Tr. 85; Tr. 89.) \n \n \nApplicant accepts full responsibility and is remorseful for his actions. He currently \nconsumes one or two beers a few nights a week, and at a social event or on the weekend, \nhe sometimes consumes 4 to 5 beers per occasion. He does not drink to the point of \nintoxication. (Tr. 46.) Following his 2016 DUI conviction, Applicant was required to have \nan interlock device installed on his vehicle for 12 months. He voluntarily maintained the \ninterlock device for an additional six months. He does not ever drink alcohol then drive. \n(Tr. 48.) Applicant regularly travels for work outside the United States, and for his personal \n\n \n \n4\nsafety and professional integrity, rarely consumes any alcohol. (GX 4; Tr. 37.) Applicant \nis dedicated to his job. In his free time, Applicant spends time with his brother and his \nfamily, exercises, socializes, and volunteers. (Answer.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor, who initially hired Applicant, was aware of \nApplicant\u2019s history of alcohol-related arrests. Applicant\u2019s supervisor testified that following \nthe 2015 DUI arrest, he determined that Applicant must follow strict requirements and \nguidelines in order to maintain his employment with the company. Specifically, Applicant \ncould not have any more alcohol-related incidents and he must participate in and comply \nwith alcohol treatment. Applicant gave permission for his supervisor to independently \nconsult with Applicant\u2019s psychiatrist regarding Applicant\u2019s treatment. Additionally, \nApplicant voluntarily discussed the details of his treatment program with his supervisor. \nApplicant has complied with these requirements. Applicant\u2019s supervisor states that \nApplicant accepts responsibility for his past, poor decisions, and that Applicant has made \npositive personal changes. Throughout Applicant\u2019s employment, his supervisor has never \nseen Applicant under the influence of alcohol while at work. Applicant\u2019s supervisor \ncontinues to support Applicant and highly recommends the continuation of his security \nclearance. Applicant\u2019s supervisor also states that Applicant is trustworthy, dependable, \nreliable, and responsible. (Tr. 105-106; AX B.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s coworkers and friends, all of whom are aware of the allegations in the \nSOR, collectively state that Applicant is a dedicated professional with good character and \nintegrity who is honest and trustworthy. They do not see any current signs of alcohol \nabuse. They highly recommend the continuance of Applicant\u2019s security clearance. (AX C \nthrough AX H.) Applicant\u2019s lifelong friend, who saw Applicant immediately following the \n2015 DUI arrest, has observed Applicant\u2019s remorse and acceptance of responsibility for \nhis past conduct, and has witnessed positive changes in Applicant\u2019s attitude and \nbehavior. (AX D.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \n\n \n \n5\nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

He was convicted for the 2004 public intoxication charge, and for the December \n2008, August 2013, and December 2015 DUIs. Applicant appropriately reported his DUI \narrests to his FSO. Following the 2015 DUI arrest, Applicant became concerned about \nhis alcohol use and voluntarily consulted a psychiatrist for evaluation and treatment. The \npsychiatrist recommended a multi-faceted treatment program, which includes moderate \nconsumption of alcohol, with which Applicant continues to comply. The psychiatrist states \nthat Applicant\u2019s alcohol use disorder has been in remission since 2016, and that his \nprognosis is good. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b) and 23(c) apply. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n7\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAny potential personal conduct concerns are mitigated for the reasons set forth \nunder the analysis of Guideline G. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d).  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines G and E in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but I \nhave also considered the following: \n \n \nApplicant voluntarily sought treatment and is complying with the requirements of \nit. He is highly respected by his supervisor, coworkers, and friends. He accepts \nresponsibility for his past conduct and has taken positive action to prevent its recurrence.  \n \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines G and \nE, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nhas mitigated the security concerns raised by his conduct. Accordingly, I conclude he has \ncarried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nhim eligibility for continued access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n8\nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \nStephanie C. Hess \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

The hearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered three \nexhibits (Exs.), noted as Exs. 1-3, and Applicant presented 15 exhibits, marked as Exs. \nA-O. With no objections, all exhibits were accepted into the record. Applicant was\ngranted through October 19, 2019, to submit any additional materials.

The\n1 The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) effective within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017. \n03/15/2019\n\n \n \n \n \n2\nrecord was then closed. In the interim, the transcript (Tr.) was received on October 11, \n2019. Based on the testimony, materials, and record as a whole, I find Applicant failed \nto mitigate security concerns. \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 54-year-old configuration and data manager who has been in that \nparticular position for two years, and with the same entity for 13 years. She receives \npositive appraisals annually and earns approximately $135,000 a year. She has \nsupported the military in some capacity since she was about 18 years old, and earned \nan income since she was 13 years old. She earned a high school diploma and attended \nsome college. Her husband recently began a job as a bus driver after being let go from \na transit agency, where he earned about $55,000. He accepted that job, which pays  \n$40,000 a year, after being unemployed from May 2018 to August 2018. The couple \nhas a teenage son. Applicant is highly community-minded and devoted to this country. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began when her husband was subject to a \ncorporate downsizing maneuver in October 2011, reducing their joint income by \n$55,000. He remained unemployed until December 2012, leaving the entire burden of \nmarital bills, child-rearing, and mortgage on Applicant alone. Since that time, Applicant \nhas received no monetary assistance from her husband, although he currently pays for \ntheir child\u2019s private school tuition. Financially maintaining their family of three on her \nsalary alone, currently amounting to about $135,000, has been \u201cvery hard.\u201d (Tr. 25) She \nadmits her financial situation is \u201ca mess.\u201d (Tr. 45). She recently started a part-time job to \nsupplement her income. (Tr. 46) Applicant has received financial counseling. She \nconcedes she did not act as quickly on her debts as she should have. (Tr. 45-46) \n \n \nAt issue in the SOR are 15 delinquent debts (1.a-1.o). The debt at 1.a is a \nmortgage past due in the amount of approximately $7,019. This situation has been \nrectified and the Applicant is now current on that account. (Ex. K; Tr. 26)  \n \nThe debts noted in the SOR at 1.b-1o consist primarily of credit card balances, \namounting to about $81,000, plus the debts at 1.l (personal loan for $7,178) and 1.o \n(time share-related judgment for $995 on a share acquired in 2011). In the past, only a \nsmattering of payments was ever applied to these debts. She acquired so much \ndelinquent credit card debt because she expected her husband to contribute more to \nthe family coffers, a dilemma dating back to 2008. (Tr. 27) At that point, she only had \none credit card. Doing her best, working hard, and applying her bonuses, however, did \nnot help. She relied increasingly on payday loans then credit cards. (Tr. 27, 35)  \n \n \nIn September 2018, Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection, a \nsolution she had hoped to avoid. (Ex. N) She had previously filed for bankruptcy around \n2004. (Tr. 32) Applicant recently submitted a proposed payment plan under which she \nwould pay $100 a month for two months, then pay $500 per month for 58 months. At the \ntime of the hearing, her proposal was pending approval. In the bankruptcy paperwork, at \nSchedule J, Applicant calculated her monthly net income. (Ex. N; Tr. 36-37) It resulted \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nin a negative net monthly remainder. She hopes to ameliorate this situation with a \nhome-based part-time job and the completion of monthly payments on her car ($435). \n \n \nAfter the hearing, Applicant provided documentary evidence that two payments \nof $100 were submitted to her bankruptcy trustee in October 2018, scheduled for \ndeposit in October and November 2018, respectively. She provided a screen shot \nindicating the one check was posted in October 2018. It is unclear whether her \nproposed payment plan has been formally implemented by the bankruptcy court. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions \nnecessarily include consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the \nnational interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nUnder Guideline F, AG \u00b6 18 sets forth that the security concern under this \nguideline is that failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.  \n \nHere, the Government offered documentary evidence reflecting that Applicant \nhas numerous delinquent debts. This is sufficient to invoke financial considerations \ndisqualifying conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the inability to do so; \nand \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nFour conditions could mitigate the finance related security concerns posed here:  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nThere are multiple delinquent debts at issue, some dating back a decade. The \nrest appear to have been acquired as Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s lack of financial \ncontributions continued despite his status as employed. To meet the challenges posed \nby insufficient income, she tried to manage the debts and took a part-time job, but was \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nunsuccessful. This is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 20(b) with regard to her acquisition of \ndelinquent debt.  \n \nApplicant has received financial counseling, but the only tangible progress she \nhas made is with regard to SOR allegation 1.a, the past-due sum on her mortgage \n(about $7,000). Meanwhile, nearly $90,000 in delinquent debt has been bundled into \nher Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition filed in September 2018, the month arrangements \nfor this October 2018 hearing were being made. Applicant provided evidence that one \ncheck for $100 has been presented to the bankruptcy trustee. Otherwise, there is no \ndocumentary evidence establishing a record of consistent and meaningful payments on \nthis bankruptcy action or any of the debts incorporated therein. At best, catching up on \nher mortgage, receiving financial counseling, and taking the first steps to seek \nprotection under Chapter 13 bankruptcy raise AG \u00b6 20(c) to a limited extent. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the her  \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Here, I have considered those \nfactors. I am also mindful that, under AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to \ngrant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment \nbased on careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nApplicant is a 54-year-old configuration and data specialist who has devoted her \nadult life to the military and working as a defense contractor. She is a lauded employee. \nApplicant is a loyal American and active within her community. She and her husband \nare raising their teenage child. For reasons yet unclear, Applicant\u2019s husband ceased \ncontributing to their family coffers a number of years ago, regardless of his employment \nstatus, except for providing for their child\u2019s tuition. This shifted the family\u2019s financial \nburden onto Applicant, not as a temporary situation, but as a permanent status. \nApplicant has tried hard to make ends on her notable salary through budgeting and \npart-time work, but the effort was futile and she relied increasingly on credit. She \nprotracted filing for bankruptcy protection in hopes that an alternative could be found, \nbut none appeared. \n \nToday, Applicant is poised to regain her financial footing with her current Chapter \n13 bankruptcy petition set to address the nearly $90,000 of delinquent debt. Her filing, \nhowever, was ill-timed in light of her hearing date. This process does not require an \napplicant to satisfy all her delinquent debts. It does, however, demand that one show \nthey have implemented an appropriate scheme for addressing that debt, and \ndocumentation reflecting a meaningful and significant track record of timely payment. \nHere, insufficient time had passed to provide such documentation. Consequently, \nfinancial considerations security concerns remain unmitigated.   \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\n   Formal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n           Subparagraphs 1.b-1.o: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n                       \n \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

He has worked for his present employer since 2015 as an acquisition management professional. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, and 15; Appellant Exhibits C, D, E, and O.) Paragraph 1 (Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption) The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he uses intoxicants to excess. Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR, with explanations. Applicant had been a habitual alcohol user for many years. Starting around 2000, he drank throughout most of the rest of his military career. Other than several brief periods of abstinence, the longest lasting several months, he drank almost daily, often having blackouts on weekends. (Tr. 20-22, 26-28, 51-52.)

Department Counsel \nwas prepared to proceed on January 30, 2018. The case was assigned to me on February \n6, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing \non March 8, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 30, 2018. The \nGovernment offered Government Exhibits 1 through 5, which were admitted without \nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant Exhibits A through \nP, which were also admitted without objection. Applicant requested that the record remain \nopen for the receipt of additional documentation. Applicant submitted a revised copy of \nApplicant Exhibit M, which provided better clarity of that exhibit, and Applicant Exhibit Q \nin a timely fashion, and they were also admitted without objection. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on May 8, 2018.  \n  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 49, separated from his wife, and has two children. He is seeking to \nretain a security clearance in connection with his work with the DoD.  \n \nApplicant graduated from the United States Naval Academy and served on active \nduty with the Navy from 1992 through 2015, when he retired as a commander (O-5). He \nhas two master\u2019s degrees. He has worked for his present employer since 2015 as an \nacquisition management professional. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, and \n15; Appellant Exhibits C, D, E, and O.) \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption) \n \n \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he uses intoxicants to excess. Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR, \nwith explanations.   \n \n \nApplicant had been a habitual alcohol user for many years. Starting around 2000, \nhe drank throughout most of the rest of his military career. Other than several brief periods \nof abstinence, the longest lasting several months, he drank almost daily, often having \nblackouts on weekends. (Tr. 20-22, 26-28, 51-52.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s first alcohol-related arrest occurred on August 23, 2003, when he was \nattending an advanced education course for the Navy. He had gone out with friends and \ndrank too much, then was arrested when he attempted to drive home. He plead nolo \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \ncontendere and was sentenced to probation for five years, along with a fine, various \nalcohol-education courses, and jail time. Applicant successfully completed all aspects of \nthe sentence. While Applicant continued to drink excessively from 2003 to 2011, he did \nnot have any alcohol-related arrests. (Government Exhibits 2 and 3; Applicant Exhibit L; \nTr. 22-26, 52.) \n \n \nThe second arrest occurred on November 16, 2014, when Applicant was assigned \nto a major Navy command. He and his wife were at a formal dinner where he became \nextremely intoxicated. Applicant and his wife had a fight, and he began to walk home. \nEventually, he stopped and fell asleep on the side of the road. He was arrested by police \nfor Disorderly Conduct and Public Intoxication. He spent the night in the drunk tank. The \ndecision was made not to press charges and Applicant was released in the morning with \nno further proceedings. (Government Exhibits 3 at 9, 4, and 5; Tr. 28-31, 53.) \n \n \nAfter his retirement in early 2015 Applicant\u2019s drinking increased. Applicant \nadmitted that his drinking affected his work, though he stated that he was never under the \ninfluence of alcohol at work. He would leave work early to meet friends and drink, or \noccasionally would not come into work after drinking the night before. (Government \nExhibit 2 at 6; Tr. 46-47, 63-65.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s third alcohol-related arrest occurred on March 17, 2016. This was 16 \nmonths after his last arrest. Applicant became extremely intoxicated on St. Patrick\u2019s Day. \nHe drove with a high blood-alcohol level and was arrested after going the wrong way on \na one-way street. Applicant plead guilty and was sentenced to probation for five years, a \nfine, to perform public service, and to attend various alcohol-related education programs. \nHe completed all the requirements of his sentence, except his probation that runs until \n2021. (Applicant Exhibit M; Tr. 32-37, 54-56.) \n \n \nAround the time of his last arrest Applicant began to realize that he had problems \nwith alcohol. At that point he began voluntarily getting personal therapy. Applicant has \nattended therapy with several counselors. One of them diagnosed Applicant with a \nSubstance Use Disorder. (Applicant Exhibits A, K, and N; Tr. 39-43, 65-69.)  \n \n \nApplicant also began attending AA on a regular basis beginning in March 2016, \nthough he continued to drink, sometimes heavily, for about a year after starting AA. He \nhas a sponsor and stated he has been clean and sober since June 23, 2017. Applicant \nstated that AA is part of his life, and he is working at creating a sober lifestyle for himself. \n(Applicant Exhibits P and Q; Tr. 37-41, 43-48, 56-62, 68-73.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline J: Criminal Conduct) \n \n \n \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for national \nsecurity eligibility because he has engaged in conduct of a criminal nature. Applicant \nadmitted the single allegation with explanations. \n \n \n2.a The SOR alleged the three arrests discussed above under Paragraph 1 are \nalso cognizable under this paragraph as criminal conduct.  \n \nMitigation \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s military records show that he had a very successful career. His fitness \nreports were outstanding, showing him to be an officer of ability. (Applicant Exhibits G, H, \nand O.) \n \n \nApplicant has been successful at his civilian job, as shown by his annual \nevaluations. Applicant\u2019s job leader, and career manager, wrote a letter of \nrecommendation. He stated, \u201c[Applicant] has been very open and honest about the legal \ntroubles that he has faced and his journey to recover from alcohol abuse.\u201d (Applicant \nExhibits F, I, and J.)  \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption) \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 22 contains seven disqualifying conditions that could raise \na security concern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions possibly apply to the facts \nin this case: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nand \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant has a long history of drinking to excess, as shown by the three alcohol-\nrelated incidents set forth in the SOR and discussed above. The last incident was in March \n2016, two years before the record closed in this case. Applicant stated that he has not \nhad anything to drink since June 23, 2017, less than a year before the record closed. He \nis on probation until 2021. Both of the cited conditions apply.   \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 23 contains four conditions that could mitigate alcohol \nconsumption security concerns.  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness or \njudgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations;  \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions were completely established in this case. \nApplicant had three alcohol-related arrests, the last in March 2016. As stated, Applicant \nwill be on probation until 2021, and continued to drink until June 2017. He appears to \nhave to have made recent strides towards sobriety while serving probation, but his \nproblem is of long duration.  Considering all the available evidence, I find that not enough \ntime has passed without an incident to establish confidence that he will not resume \ndrinking and acting irresponsibly while under the influence. The Alcohol Consumption \nguideline is found against Applicant. \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline J: Criminal Conduct) \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 31 contains five disqualifying conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions apply: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation. \n \nApplicant had three alcohol-connected criminal incidents between 2003 and 2016. \nHe is currently on probation until 2021 for his last DUI conviction. \n \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 32 contains four conditions that could mitigate criminal \nconduct security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense;  \nand \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \nApplicant had gone almost two years without an alcohol-related criminal incident \nas of the date of his hearing. However, as stated above, his sobriety is in its early stages.  \nBased on the available record, it is not possible to say with any certainty that alcohol-\nrelated criminal incidents will not happen in the future. Of particular concern is the fact \nthat he is still on probation.  Not enough time has passed to make a positive decision in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. Guideline J is found against Applicant. \n \n \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant=s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.    \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity significance of his alcohol use and related criminal conduct. His two post-\nretirement incidents occurred 16 months apart, and he continued drinking for 15 months \nafter the serious DUI in March 2016. His recent abstinence while serving probation is \ncommendable, but is not yet sufficient to establish rehabilitation or confidence that \nrecurrence is unlikely. Overall, the record evidence does create substantial doubt as to \nApplicant=s present suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by & E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant=s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n                                                \n \n \n \n \nWILFORD H. ROSS \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant\u2019s Counsel \n \n \nJanuary 17, 2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nCEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge: \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 31, 2017, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended \n(Directive), the Department of Defense issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts that raise security concerns under Guideline B. The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 7, 2017, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on February \n12, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of \nhearing on February 15, 2018, scheduling the hearing for May 22, 2018. The hearing \nwas convened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4, which \nwere admitted without objection. GX 4 asked for Administrative Notice. Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf and called one witness. Applicant presented a set of \n\n \n2 \n \ndocuments, which I marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AppX) A. DOHA received the transcript \nof the hearing (TR) on June 7, 2018. \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \n \nAt the hearing, the Government requested I take administrative notice of certain \nfacts relating to Afghanistan. Department Counsel provided an seven-page summary of \nthe facts, supported by six Government documents pertaining to Afghanistan, identified \nas GX 4. The documents provide elaboration and context for the summary. I take \nadministrative notice of the facts included in the U.S. Government reports. They are \nlimited to matters of general knowledge, not subject to reasonable dispute. They are set \nout in the Findings of Fact. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted to the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a., with explanation. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 66-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (GX 1 at pages 5 \nand 11.) He has been employed with the defense contractor since June of 2009, and \nhas held a security clearance since September of 2010. (GX 1 at pages 11 and 56.) He \nis married to a naturalized U.S. citizen, and has four children, three of whom are native \nborn Americans. (GX 1 at pages 18~19, and 23~25.)  \n \n \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \n \n \n1.a. Applicant has five close relatives who are citizens and residents of \nAfghanistan. His three sisters are housewives. (TR at page 14 line 2 to page 17 line 17, \nat page 23 line 6 to page 26 line 17, and at page 27 line 5 to page 28 line 8.) His brother \nis a retired school principal, and his brother-in-law is \u201ca low clerk,\u201d working for the \nAfghan Government. (Id.) Applicant has monthly contact with his Afghan relatives, who \nhave no idea of what Applicant does as a contractor. (TR at page 14 line 2 to page 17 \nline 17, at page 23 line 6 to page 26 line 17, and at page 27 line 5 to page 28 line 8.) \nApplicant\u2019s mother and other brother-in-law have passed away. \n \n \nApplicant has submitted two letters of support from two U.S. Army Colonels. \n(AppX A at pages 1 and 2.) These letters attest to his excellent work history, and \ndedication and commitment to our forces. \n \nNotice \n \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts: A U.S. State Department Travel \nWarning remains in effect for Afghanistan. Extremists  are active throughout the country. \nHowever, Afghanistan remains an important partner in of the fight against terrorism. \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology \n \n  \nApplicant has five close relatives who are citizens and residents of Afghanistan. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s connections with his foreign relatives is far outweighed by his \nconnections with his adopted country, and his immediate family connections in the \nUnited States. Foreign Influence is found for Applicant.  \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant has a distinguished history of working with our forces in Afghanistan, \nas evidenced by two letters of support from U.S. Army Colonels. He performs well at his \njob. He can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States \ndue to his longstanding ties here.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the Foreign Influence security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Gregorian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Thomas Albin, Esq. \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant defaulted on a $43,990 private student loan obtained for college because \nof lack of income for herself and her parents, who had promised to assist her in repayment. \nShe is making timely monthly payments on her other student loans and other debts, and is \nwilling to repay the delinquent loan, but the creditor is not willing to accept what she can \nafford. The debt is not likely to be a source of pressure for Applicant, given it has been \nwritten off by the creditor. Clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 14, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing a security \nconcern under Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR explained why the DOD \nCAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for her. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \n08/23/2018\n\n2 \n \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn December 1, 2017, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \nOn February 9, 2018, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine \nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. On February 27, 2018, I scheduled a hearing for March 21, 2018. \n \nAt the hearing, which I convened as scheduled, five Government exhibits (GEs 1-5) \nand four Applicant exhibits (AEs A-D) were admitted in evidence. A January 3, 2018 letter \nforwarding a copy of the GEs to Applicant and a list of the GEs were marked as hearing \nexhibits (HEs) I and II but not admitted as evidentiary exhibits. Applicant and her father \ntestified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on March 30, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of November 14, 2017, Applicant owed \na single, charged-off debt for $68,240 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). When Applicant answered the SOR, \nshe admitted the debt without explanation. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and \ntranscript, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 25 years old and unmarried. She is the second of six children born to \nimmigrant parents. (GE 1; Tr. 43-44, 80.) Two of Applicant\u2019s sisters (both younger) were in \ncollege as of March 2018. (Tr. 44, 87.) Applicant has been cohabiting with her boyfriend in \nhis apartment since July 2016. (GE 5; Tr. 17-18, 51.) \n \nApplicant has worked for a defense contractor since June 2016. She started as a \nlearner in her trade and quickly progressed through six steps. With the approval of \nmanagement, she was selected for a leadership position in her group and has added \nresponsibilities in that regard. In 2018, she was promoted to a draftsman position. As of \nMarch 2018, Applicant was working 45 to 50 hours per week and sometimes 55 hours per \nweek. Applicant held a company-issued clearance that was withdrawn on issuance of the \nSOR. Because Applicant is a valued employee, her supervisor found work for her that \ncurrently does not require a security clearance. (Tr. 19-23.) \n \n Applicant graduated from high school in 2010. (Tr. 30, 50.) In August 2010, she \nmatriculated in a private university at a cost of approximately $44,000 annually, inclusive of \nroom and board and books. Applicant obtained a private student loan for $43,990 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a) to pay for her first year of college. She was contractually liable on the loan but signed \nwith the understanding from her parents that they would repay most of the loan for her.1 \n(GE 2; Tr. 30-31, 43, 46, 58.) Applicant\u2019s father testified that he and his spouse expected to \nhelp their daughter repay the loan. He had worked in construction part time while being \n                                                 \n1 Applicant indicated during her May 18, 2017 subject interview that her father had co-signed on the loan. (GE \n5.) Her father testified that he co-signed for the loan. (Tr. 93.) Available credit information indicates that the \naccount was opened individually. (GE 3.) \n\n3 \n \nemployed as a police officer for many years. After he retired from the police force in 2006, \nhe began working in construction full time. (Tr. 81.) His income from the construction \nbusiness fluctuated. He earned $400,000 annually in 2007 and 2009 and $200,000 in \n2012. He did not anticipate there would be a problem helping Applicant financially. (Tr. 94-\n97.) \n \n \nTo reduce her college expenses, Applicant transferred to her state university at the \nstart of her sophomore year.2 She lived on campus, but the move still saved her \napproximately $20,000 a year. (Tr. 32-33, 47-48.) Applicant obtained federal student loans \nfor college starting in August 2011 that totaled $24,501. For her junior year, she and her \nfather jointly obtained a private student loan for $14,062 from lender X in October 2012. \n(GE 3.) A Dean\u2019s List student at the university, Applicant was forced to withdraw from \ncollege in December 2013 when her application for a student loan for her final semester \nwas denied. Applicant\u2019s father was to be a co-signer on that loan, but his construction \nbusiness was not doing very well. (Tr. 33-35, 56-58.) Applicant\u2019s father testified that his \nthen business partner in 2012 embezzled approximately $650,000 from the business and \ntook off for parts unknown. (Tr. 88.) Applicant\u2019s father was left holding the notes on several \nproperties owned jointly by him and his former business partner. (Tr. 89, 98.) He sold one \nof the properties at a loss, but has continued to incur expenses (insurance, mortgage \npayments, taxes, maintenance) for other properties.3 (Tr. 90.) After he paid off debts and \nexpenses for the properties, he cleared about $20,000 to $30,000 in income. (Tr. 91.) It \nhas been a financial struggle since then, even with his police retirement pay of $49,250 \nannually. (Tr. 94-96.) \n \n \nApplicant had a part-time job at a fast-food restaurant since June 2008, but her \nincome was not enough to cover the costs of college. (GEs 1, 5.) After she left college, in \naddition to her student loan debts, Applicant owed $6,200 to the university in unpaid tuition \nand other expenses. (GEs 1, 5.) Applicant lived at home with her parents and siblings. She \nworked as many hours as she could at the fast-food restaurant. She became a full-time \nemployee during her last year on the job. (Tr. 52.) She held a second part-time job at night \nwith a competitor from January 2015 to May 2015. In August 2015, she moved into her \nown apartment and obtained a car loan of $16,326 for a 2011 model-year vehicle. (GEs 1, \n3, 5; Tr. 61.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s $6,200 debt with the university was placed for collection in the summer \nof 2014. In response to a collection letter, Applicant paid $100 a month toward the debt by \nautomatic deduction from her bank account. After about a year, her debt was transferred to \nanother collection entity. Applicant failed to notice that the withdrawals for the debt had \nceased. In February 2016, she received a notice for collection of the $4,700 balance. She \n                                                 \n2 Applicant had applied to the university while she was finishing high school, but she was not accepted. (Tr. 59-\n60.) \n \n3 Applicant\u2019s father testified that he still has income property purchased by the business consisting of a six-\nfamily home, a single-family house, a duplex, and 42 acres of undeveloped land. He managed to sell a \nproperty at a loss, but he lost another to foreclosure. (Tr. 101-102.) \n\n4 \n \nmade a lump-sum payment to fully satisfy the debt in February 2016 with funds provided by \nher parents. (GEs 1, 5.) \n \n \nWhen her student loan that she obtained at age 18 for her freshman year of college \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) came out of deferment, Applicant was required to pay $741 a month, which \nshe could not afford on her income of $13.50 an hour from the fast-food restaurant. (Tr. \n51.) Applicant\u2019s account was closed in February 2015 and placed for collection. She made \na $300 payment in April 2015,4 but while her payment was accepted, she was told that her \nmonthly obligation had increased to $790. As of February 2016, she owed a charged-off \nbalance of $68,240. The creditor wrote off the balance to profit and loss.5 (GE 5; Tr. 38.) \nHer other private student loan came out of deferment in July 2014 and has not been \ndelinquent. Applicant recalls making payments toward that loan in 2015. (Tr. 33.) As of July \n2017, her monthly payment was approximately $212 on a balance of $11,804. (GE 3.) Her \nconsolidated federal student loan balance of $23,772 was reportedly in deferment as of \nMarch 2016. (GE 2.) The balance of her consolidated federal student loans was $24,925 \nas of June 2017. (GE 3.) \n \n \nApplicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86) on March 21, 2016. She listed two routine delinquencies, \nconsisting of her debt with the university, which she paid off in February 2016, and the \ncharged-off private student loan alleged in the SOR. She explained that her student loan \nhad been recently charged off because she could not afford the $790 monthly payments \ndemanded by the creditor. (GE 1.) In early June 2016, Applicant left her position as an \nassistant manager for the fast-food restaurant to work for her current employer, a defense \ncontractor, at $15 an hour. (Tr. 52, 78.) \n \n \nOn May 18, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant indicated that she had made only one \n$300 payment on a student loan that had been charged off. She made no further payments \nbecause the creditor was not willing to accept a smaller monthly payment that she could \nafford. Applicant added that she had obtained her credit report in March 2016, which \nshowed the account as charged off and closed. She assumed that she no longer had to \npay the debt. She had not been contacted about the debt in over a year. Applicant \nexpressed her intention to follow up with the lender to ensure that she no longer owes on \nthe account. If she discovers she is still responsible for repayment, she is willing to make \n$200 to $300 monthly payments until it is satisfied in full. She indicated that she is able to \npay her other bills on her income from her defense-contractor employment. She did not \nintend to fall behind on any accounts in the future or to borrow more money than she can \nafford to repay. Applicant presented extracts from an updated credit report showing that \n                                                 \n4 Applicant speculated that she may have paid the $300 in October 2014. (Tr. 66.) Available credit information \nshows a date of last payment in April 2015. (GE 5.) \n \n5 As of May 2017, TransUnion was reporting a date of February 28, 2015, for closure of her account and a last \npayment on the account of April 17, 2015. Equifax was reporting the debt as in collection/charge off as of \nFebruary 2015. (GE 5.) The debt was reported in collection for $68,240 as of March 2016, but also as a \ncharge off. (GE 2.) \n\n5 \n \nshe was making timely payments of $335 per month on her car loan and $212 on her \nprivate student loan with lender X. (GE 5.) \n \n \nApplicant is paying her car loan, her consolidated federal student loans, and her \nstudent loan with lender X on time. Her federal student loans (subsidized and \nunsubsidized) have been in a debt relief program since 2016 where her repayment is \nbased on her income. She is currently paying $251 per month toward her federal student-\nloan debt and approximately $212 per month toward her private student loan with lender X. \n(AE C; Tr. 35-37, 50, 71.)  \n \n \nIn October or November 2017, Applicant contacted the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a to \npossibly arrange for repayment of her charged-off student loan. (Tr. 66-67.) She was given \nthree options to repay the balance: $1,100 a month until fully satisfied; five years of equal \nmonthly payments toward a reduced settlement of $64,000; or $680 a month for the first \nthree months and then equal monthly payments toward the remaining balance over the \nnext 4.75 years. Applicant informed the creditor that she could not afford the payments, but \nthat she could pay $200 a month until her other student loans and car payment are \nsatisfied. The creditor refused her counteroffer. (Tr. 40-41; Tr. 66.) Applicant did not \nconsider sending any money to the creditor at that time because she \u201cdidn\u2019t think it would \ndo anything.\u201d (Tr. 62.) In early March 2018, Applicant sent the creditor a $200 payment that \nhas not been cashed. The SOR was a factor in her deciding to send the payment. (Tr. 63.) \nShe has not received a 1099-C Cancellation of Debt form from the creditor, but interest is \nno longer accruing on the debt. (GE 4; Tr. 41-42, 68.) If the creditor accepts the payment, \nshe intends to continue repayment at $200 a month. (Tr. 42.) When her vehicle loan is paid \noff in 2021, she will increase her payment on the defaulted student loan by $335 (the \namount of her car payment). In 2023, her private student loan with lender X will be paid off, \nso she can put another $215 each month toward the defaulted student loan. (Tr. 49.) \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s cohabitant boyfriend is a registered nurse. He is on the lease for their \napartment and pays the rent of $800 a month. (Tr. 29, 50, 70.) Applicant pays the \nelectricity, cable, and telephone bills, which totaled approximately $413 a month as of \nMarch 2018. (AE A; Tr. 29.) Her base hourly wage is now $19.69. (AE B; Tr. 25.) After \npaying her expenses and her student loans, including the $200 toward the defaulted \nstudent loan, she is left with $38 in net discretionary monthly income based on a 40-hour \nwork week. However, because of her routine overtime averaging 45 to 55 hours a week, \nshe nets about $560 a month. She was paid a $500 bonus in January 2018.  (AE A.) She \nhas approximately $1,000 in combined checking and savings deposits. (Tr. 69.) She has \nhad no financial counseling. (Tr. 70-71.)  \n \n \nApplicant is only two classes short of earning her bachelor\u2019s degree. She plans to \ncomplete her degree when she can afford to return to school. (Tr. 35, 54.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father cannot presently provide her any financial assistance. After his \nformer partner\u2019s embezzlement, his spouse reorganized the articles and made herself 98% \nowner of the business. (Tr. 91.) In the fall of 2017, his spouse abandoned their marriage. \n\n6 \n \nApplicant\u2019s father still has three children living at home. He is currently helping his two \ndaughters in college with their educational expenses. (Tr. 103-104.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor described Applicant as a highly reliable and exceptional \nworker. For her excellent performance, she was submitted for two non-automatic \nprogressions in pay and approved as a working leader or \u201ctutor.\u201d As a \u201ctutor,\u201d Applicant acts \nas a resource helping with training, mentoring, process improvement, and production \nsupport. In her supervisor\u2019s opinion, Applicant \u201ccontinues to grow and improve at an \nexponential rate.\u201d (AE D.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \n\n7 \n \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nAn applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage her finances \nin a way as to exhibit sound judgment and responsibility. The concern under Guideline F is \nbroader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly compromise classified \ninformation in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns about an individual\u2019s self-\ncontrol, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified information. \n \n \nApplicant defaulted on a private student loan that she obtained for $43,990 in July \n2010. She could not afford to make the $741 monthly payments required when her loan \ncame out of deferment in 2014 on her then hourly wage of $13.50, and her loan was \ncharged off for $68,240. Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and \nAG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d are established. The \nGovernment\u2019s case for application of AG \u00b6 19(b), \u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless \nof the ability to do so,\u201d is not persuasive. Applicant testified credibly to her willingness to \nmake $200 monthly payments toward the debt. Although the creditor is demanding $790 \nmonthly payments, Applicant sent a $200 payment in early March 2018 to show her good \nfaith. \n \nThe burden is on Applicant to mitigate the negative implications for her financial \njudgment raised by her student loan default. Application of the aforesaid disqualifying \nconditions triggers consideration of the potentially mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20. \nFour of the seven mitigating conditions warrant some consideration and could potentially \napply in whole or in part. They are: \n \n\n8 \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) applies in that the financial behavior of concern is \u201cso infrequent.\u201d  Her \ndefault of a single student loan, albeit her largest loan, appears aberrational and not \ncharacteristic of her handling of her financial obligations generally. Applicant does not have \na history of serious delinquency on credit cards, car loans, utilities, rent, or other living \nexpenses. Moreover, the student loan was obtained when she was only 18 years old to pay \nfor her first year of college with a reasonable expectation that her parents would assist her \nin repaying the loan. The circumstances are not likely to recur, given that Applicant has no \nintention of returning to school to finish her degree before she can afford to cover the cost. \nEven so, the mitigating impact of AG \u00b6 20(a) is undermined somewhat because of her lack \nof progress toward resolving the debt. She made only one payment toward the debt, of \n$300 in April 2015, while her account was in collections. Since then, she attempted a \npayment of $200 in early March 2018, but it was unclear as of the close of the record \nwhether it was accepted. Furthermore, a debt that became delinquent several years ago is \nstill considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a \ncontinuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the \nGuideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \n \n \nApplicant obtained the student loan at age 18 knowing that she would be legally \nliable for repayment at some future date. Even so, she reasonably relied on assurances \nfrom her parents that they would assist her in repayment, and she could not have foreseen \nthe negative financial impact that persists on her father\u2019s income from his former partner\u2019s \ncriminal activity in 2012. AG \u00b6 20(b) applies in that her ability to repay the debt was \ncompromised by circumstances beyond her control. As to whether Applicant acted \nresponsibly, in response to a collections effort, she made a $300 payment in April 2015, \nwhich was what she could afford at the time. The creditor was not willing to accept anything \nless than the full monthly payment, which by then was $790. She lived with her parents, \nand it is unclear whether she contributed to the household expenses, but she was earning \n\n9 \n \nonly $13.50 an hour. She had living expenses and other student loans to repay. One could \nquestion Applicant\u2019s financial judgment in that she moved into an apartment from her \nparents\u2019 home in August 2015 and obtained a car loan. The rent and car expenses could \nhave instead gone to pay her defaulted student loan.6  Applicant did not explain why she \nmoved at that time. However, she held a reasonable belief based on the student loan \nlender\u2019s unwillingness to accept lower, affordable monthly payments that the creditor would \nnot work with her toward resolving the debt. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established, given the lack of progress toward resolving her \ndefaulted student loan. She has also not had financial counseling, although she has a \nbudget and has demonstrated that she does not live beyond her means. AG \u00b6 20(d) has \nsome applicability in that she paid $300 in April 2015 in an effort to demonstrate her good-\nfaith willingness to make payments toward the delinquency. Applicant re-contacted the \ncreditor in October or November 2017 about possible repayment arrangements. She was \ngiven three repayment options, none of which she could afford. Just two weeks before her \nsecurity clearance hearing, she sent the creditor $200 in an attempt to start repayment, but \nhad yet to receive confirmation of its acceptance. Applicant expressed her intention to \ncontinue to pay $200 a month toward the debt if the creditor accepts her payment. The \nAppeal Board has consistently held that a promise to pay a debt in the future is not a \nsubstitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner. See e.g., ISCR Case No. \n09-05390 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2010). Even so, an applicant is not required, as a matter \nof law, to establish that she has paid off every debt in the SOR. She is required to \ndemonstrate that she has established a plan to resolve her financial problems and taken \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. \nMay 21, 2008) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Applicant\u2019s track record of \npayments on her private student loan with lender X and her consolidated federal student \nloan under an income-based debt relief program inspire confidence that she would make \nthe $200 monthly payments if the creditor is willing to accept them. \n \n \nEven assuming that the creditor is willing to accept $200 monthly payments and that \nshe increases her monthly repayment amount once her private student loan with lender X \nand her car loan are paid off, it will be many years before Applicant fully satisfies her \n$68,240 student loan delinquency. It is a substantial debt burden based on her current \nincome, even with her overtime earnings. However, student loans are an investment in \none\u2019s future and do not carry the same judgment concerns as would excessive credit card \ndebt. Applicant has no record of irresponsible spending or overreliance on consumer credit \ncard debt. It is unlikely that the defaulted student loan will be a source of undue pressure \nfor her, given the creditor has written off the debt to profit and loss. While the Government \nhas legitimate concerns about Applicant earning college credits that she has not paid for, \nshe acted reasonably by attempting to work out affordable repayment terms. \n                                                 \n6 When asked on cross-examination whether her cohabitation with her boyfriend since July 2016 has freed up \nmoney for her to address some of her financial obligations, Applicant responded, \u201cYes because instead of \npaying $400 in rent I don\u2019t pay the rent. He pays the $800 in rent total and I just pay the extras\u2014electricity, \nphone bill, and cable. (Tr. 69-70.) Applicant clearly reduced her rent expenses, but it is unclear whether the \n$400 was her previous rent or whether she was saving $400 because her boyfriend is not asking her for her \nshare of their present rent. \n\n10 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). The analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but \nsome warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant\u2019s situation is not unlike that of many students of her generation who take \nout loans for their college education expecting to land a job at some future date at an \nincome sufficient to repay them, but then find themselves underemployed when the loans \ncome due. Applicant showed sound financial judgment in attempting to minimize her \ncollege costs by transferring from a private college to her state university at the end of her \nfreshman year. Circumstances outside of her control forced her to withdraw from the \nuniversity just one semester short of earning her degree. It had negative consequences for \nher in that it compromised her chances of obtaining employment at an income sufficient to \nrepay her student loans and escalated the date on which she was required to begin \nrepayment of her student loans. \n \nApplicant obtained a part-time job for a few months in 2015 while working full time \nas an assistant manager for a fast-food establishment. Her willingness to work a second \njob to address her financial obligations shows a positive attitude toward handling her \nfinances. She is credited with being willing to start at the bottom as a learner in a trade with \na defense contractor. She has fulfilled her duties in an exceptional manner, and her \ncommitment and progress have been rewarded through non-automatic progressions in pay \nand promotions. Her supervisor attested to her growth having been at an exponential rate. \nShe has not displayed behavior that would lead one to doubt her intentions with regard to \nresolving her defaulted student loan under a repayment plan that she can afford on her \nincome if given the opportunity. \n \n \nThe security clearance adjudication involves an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in light of the security guidelines in the Directive. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). It is not intended as a debt \ncollection process or designed to punish applicants for past mistakes or shortcomings. \nAfter considering all the facts and circumstances of record, I conclude that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for \nApplicant. \n \nFormal Finding \n \nFormal finding for or against Applicant on the allegation set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, is: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n\n11 \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n \n \n_____________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Smith, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on July 27, 2016. On \nNovember 9, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nF. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in\nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines\n(December 10, 2016), for all adjudicative decisions on or after June 8, 2017.\nApplicant answered the SOR on December 6, 2017, and requested a decision on \nthe written record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s \nwritten case on July 11, 2018. On September 5, 2018, a complete copy of the file of \n12/26/2018\n\n \n2 \n \nrelevant material (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was given an opportunity to file \nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s \nevidence. He received the FORM on September 17, 2018, and submitted a timely \nresponse. The case was assigned to me on December 14, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nApplicant disclosed in his SCA that he was in a payment plan with the IRS for \nfederal income taxes. (FORM Item 2.) The SOR alleges that Applicant owes $11,564 in \ndelinquent federal income taxes (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and that he failed to timely file his federal \nincome tax return for tax year 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he \nadmitted both allegations with explanations. His admissions are incorporated in my \nfindings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 52-year-old security-systems engineer employed by defense \ncontractors since October 2012. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in information \ntechnology security in January 2009 and a master\u2019s degree in information security \nassurance in January 2010. He has been employed as an adjunct professor at several \nuniversities since February 2010. He married in September 1993 and has four children, \nages 23, 22, 17, and 16. He has held a security clearance since November 2012. \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he stated that his tax debt was due to \u201cerrors in \nmy tax filing.\u201d He did not provide any further details. He stated that he was making \npayments as required on a payment plan for the tax debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He did \nnot provide any documentary evidence of a payment plan or payments. Department \nCounsel requested that he provide a tax transcript for 2014 showing payments, but he \ndid not comply with the request. In Department Counsel\u2019s submission, she pointed out \nthe absence of documentation to support Applicant\u2019s statements. \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he submitted a document reflecting that he \nhad made one $350 payment in May 2018 and five $200 payments from May through \nSeptember 2018 on a debt for tax year 2014. However, the document does not contain \nany indicia that it was issued by the IRS. He did not submit any documentary evidence of \na payment agreement. He asserted that he also made $200 payments in June through \nOctober 2018, but he submitted no documentation of these payments. He stated that he \nhad reduced his indebtedness to the IRS from $11,564 to $7,005, but he provided no \ndocumentation to support his statement. \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he stated that he believed that he electronically \nfiled his federal income tax return for tax year 2016, and that he had mailed a hard copy \nof the 2016 tax return to the IRS, but he provided no documentation to support his \nstatement. In his response to the FORM, he repeated his statement that he had filed his \n2016 return, elaborating that his tax return was received by the IRS and was processed \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (FORM Item 2) unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n\n \n3 \n \non June 18, 2018. However, he did not submit any documentary evidence in his SOR \nanswer or response to the FORM showing that the 2016 return had been filed. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s responses to the SOR and the FORM and the documentary evidence \nin the FORM establish the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \n\n \n5 \n \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nNone of these mitigating conditions are established. Applicant\u2019s tax delinquencies \nare recent. He submitted no evidence of unusual circumstances or conditions beyond his \ncontrol that caused him to incur the tax debt and fail to timely file his 2016 tax return. He \nsubmitted no evidence of counseling. Although he asserted that he was making \npayments, he submitted no documentary evidence of payments or a payment agreement, \ndespite being reminded by Department Counsel at least twice of the need for \ndocumentation. When applicants assert that debts are being resolved, they are expected \nto present documentary evidence to support their assertions. ISCR Case No. 15-03363 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2016). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).2  \n                                                          \n2 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding \nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for \nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of \ncontinuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant submitted no evidence related \nto his job performance, professional reputation, or community involvement. Because he \nrequested a determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to \nevaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 \nat 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions \nunder Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his tax \ndelinquencies. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F.

Petcher, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant\u2019s spouse stopped paying on some of his credit card accounts without his \nknowledge. After he was notified by the IRS that he owed taxes for 2012, he ran a credit \ncheck in 2016 and learned that some of his credit accounts were seriously delinquent. He \nhas been repaying most of his delinquent consumer credit debts since 2016 and has taken \nsteps to address federal and state income tax issues from tax year 2012. Clearance is \ngranted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 9, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR explained why the DOD \nCAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \n09/24/2018\n\n2 \n \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on December 5, 2017, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \nOn April 18, 2018, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine whether \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. On April 24, 2018, I scheduled a hearing for May 17, 2018. \n \nAt the hearing, four Government exhibits (GEs 1-4) were admitted. A December 20, \n2017 letter forwarding the proposed GEs to Applicant and a list of the GEs were marked as \nhearing exhibits (HEs I-II) for the record but not admitted in evidence. Twelve Applicant \nexhibits (AEs A-L) were admitted in evidence, and Applicant testified, as reflected in a \ntranscript (Tr.) received on June 6, 2018. \n \nI held the record open for one month for post-hearing submissions from Applicant. \nNo documents were received by the deadline, so the record closed on June 16, 2018. \n \nSummary of SOR Allegations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of November 9, 2017, Applicant owed \ndelinquent federal income taxes of $20,575 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and state income taxes of $3,934 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b) for tax year 2012, and that he failed to timely file his state income tax return for \ntax year 2012 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Additionally, Applicant allegedly owed past-due debt totaling \n$4,898 on six accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.i). \n \n \nWhen Applicant responded to the SOR, Applicant denied the tax debts and failure to \ntimely file his state income tax return for 2012. He admitted the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d \n($1,894), 1.e ($1,069), 1.g ($626), 1.h ($235), and 1.i ($210), but indicated that he was \nmaking payments on the debts and, in the case of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i, had fully satisfied \nit. Applicant explained that the delinquencies resulted from lower income following his job \nlayoff in 2011. His spouse handled the bills, and she hid their financial situation from him. \n(Answer.) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 51 years old and a college graduate. He and his spouse married in May \n1991, and they have two sons, now ages 21 and 24. For most of their marriage, Applicant\u2019s \nspouse did not work outside the home. Applicant has worked as a staff scientist with his \ncurrent employer since May 2011. He holds a secret clearance that was granted to him in \nSeptember 2011. (GEs 1-2; AE L; Tr. 44-48.) \n \n\n3 \n \nApplicant worked as a reliability engineer and scientist for a company from July \n2000 to April 2011, when he was laid off. (GE 1; AE L.) He was given severance pay of \n$20,000, but he lost a job paying him $105,000 a year, and his spouse was unemployed. In \nMay 2011, Applicant began working for his current employer at an annual salary of \n$79,000. (GE 2; Tr. 40, 48.) \n \nApplicant cashed in his retirement account of $50,000 in 2012, and he used those \nfunds to pay for his older son\u2019s college expenses. That premature withdrawal of retirement \nassets had income tax implications. (GE 2; Tr. 67.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse handled the family\u2019s finances, including filing their income tax \nreturns. Applicant and his spouse prepared their tax returns, using tax software purchased \nonline. (GE 2; Tr. 32, 52.) In 2015 or 2016, they were notified by the IRS that they owed \ndelinquent income taxes for tax year 2012.1 Applicant checked his computer and could find \nno record of their 2012 tax returns. He assumed that the returns had been filed, and that \nhe was a victim of computer hacking or a scam. (GE 2; Tr. 56-57.) He later learned that \nneither the IRS nor the state had any record of them filing a return for 2012. Substitute \nreturns were filed by the IRS and state, and tax liabilities were assessed.2 (Tr. 36, 57.) \nApplicant does not now know for certain whether their tax return for 2012 was filed as \nrequired by law. (Tr. 52.) \n \nConcerned that he might be the victim of identity theft, Applicant obtained a copy of \nhis credit report in 2016, which revealed that some of his consumer credit accounts were \nseriously delinquent. His spouse had used his credit cards and hidden from him that she \nwas not making payments. (GEs 1, 3.) \n \nOn July 15, 2016, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). In response to the financial record \ninquiries, Applicant responded affirmatively to the following question: \u201cIn the past seven \n(7) years have you failed to file or pay Federal, state, or other taxes when required by law \nor ordinance?\u201d Applicant indicated that he had recently discovered that he owed $23,000 in \nfederal and state income taxes from 2012, which he believed to be inaccurate. He added \nthat he had retained a lawyer to investigate the error,3 and expressed his concern that \n                                                 \n1 The evidentiary record contains discrepant debts about when and how Applicant was notified of his tax \nproblems for 2012. He told an investigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in June 2017 that \nhe received notification from the IRS in June 2015 that he owed $3,851 to the IRS for tax year 2012. (GE 2.) \nAt his hearing, he testified that he learned he had a potential tax issue in 2016 when he obtained his credit \nreport that listed his tax liabilities. (Tr. 53-54.) \n \n2 As of April 30, 2018, the IRS was reporting an outstanding tax liability of $18,865 for tax year 2012.  There is \nno record in evidence showing the state tax liability. SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges a state tax debt of $3,934 for 2012. \nApplicant disputed the debt in November 2017. (GE 2.) His tax return prepared in March 2018 showed a state \nunderpayment for 2012 of $2,174. (AE J.) \n \n3 Applicant named the attorney and provided her contact information on his SF 86, and he indicated during a \nJune 2017 interview with an OPM investigator that he immediately contacted the tax attorneys, to whom he \npaid $500 upfront to resolve the issue. (GE 2.) At his hearing, he submitted an email (GE G) of October 27, \n2016, from an attorney with a tax relief firm of a different name and contact information. The attorney indicated \n\n4 \n \n\u201csomeone has stolen [his] information and claiming [sic] extra income in an attempt to get \nmoney.\u201d In response to questions involving delinquency involving routine accounts, \nApplicant listed three credit card debts, of $2,944 (SOR \u00b6 1.d), $1,486 (SOR \u00b6 1.e), and \n$585 (SOR \u00b6 1.1.h), and added that he was making monthly payments to resolve them. He \nprovided the following reason for the credit card debts: \n \nWhen the tax discrepancy surfaced I ran a credit report and discovered \nseveral unresolved credit card problems. Since my wife manages our home \nfinances I spoke with her regarding the credit card issues. She \nacknowledged that they were legitimate and had attempted to conceal them \nfrom me. \n \n \nApplicant listed two other debts on his SF 86: a $14,000 car loan debt that was paid \noff with funds borrowed from his parents, and a $10,000 student loan obtained for his older \nson\u2019s education. The loan came out of deferment when his son had to suspend his studies \nfor medical reasons. (GE 1.) Neither of those debts was alleged in the SOR. Available \ncredit information shows that the student loan was delinquent in February 2015, October \n2015, and November 2015.  (GE 4.)  The issue was resolved by the loan again being \ndeferred. (GE 1.) The car loan was obtained in October 2011 for $26,759. Payments were \ncurrent until the spring of 2014, and the loan was charged off in the fall of 2014 for \n$14,244. Applicant borrowed funds from his parents and paid off the loan.4 (GE 3.)  \n \n \nAvailable credit reports (GEs 3-4) and payment records reflect the following \nconsumer credit delinquencies and some payments toward the debts. \n \nCharged-off credit card for $1,894 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit card account, which he opened in July 2006, was charged off and \nclosed in 2014 for nonpayment. In approximately October 2016, Applicant began repaying \nthe debt at $75 per month. As of November 2016, the past-due balance was $2,644. He \n                                                                                                                                                             \nthat he had just received Applicant\u2019s inquiry and been assigned to his case. At his hearing, Applicant testified \nthat the attorney he listed on his SF 86 was not accurate, and he found out that he had retained the services of \nthe company in AE G. (Tr. 54-55.) Applicant provided no evidence linking the two attorneys or tax firms. Given \nhis history of switching tax relief firms, he may have retained a new tax firm. He presented no documentation \nof payment to the attorney listed on his SF 86 or to the tax firm identified in AE G. He testified that the tax firm \nin AE G was the only tax relief company that had contacted the IRS and state tax authority on his behalf. (Tr. \n60.) \n \n4 Applicant indicated on his SF 86 that he and his spouse had difficulty with the car manufacturer\u2019s financing \nand their online electronic payment tools. (GE 1.) During his subject interview (GE 2) and at his hearing (Tr. \n65), he explained that he had traded in a hybrid vehicle in October 2011 for his current car. In the fall of 2014, \nhe received a call indicating that he was behind four months on his payments for the loan for the hybrid vehicle \nthat he had not owned for two years. Available credit reports show that Applicant obtained a vehicle loan for \n$24,554 that was paid off and closed in November 2011. (GE 3.) That loan was likely for the hybrid. The \nevidence suggests a problem with Applicant\u2019s payments for his current vehicle. Although the delinquency was \nnot alleged, it is relevant to assessing Applicant\u2019s understanding of his finances and whether he can be \ncounted on to pay his debt obligations going forward. \n\n5 \n \ncontinued to make the payments to reduce the balance to $1,894 as of September 2017. \nAfter his May 2018 payment, the balance was $1,369. (GEs 1-4; AE D; Tr. 28.) \n \nCollection debt for $1,069 (SOR \u00b6 1.e) \n \n \nApplicant opened a credit card account with a retail clothing company in November \n2008. In February 2015, a past-due balance of $1,486 was placed with a collection entity \nafter no payments since November 2013. In July 2016, Applicant contacted the creditor \nand began repaying the debt under terms acceptable to his creditor. During a June 2017 \ninterview with an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator, Applicant indicated \nthat he had arranged to make 50 payments of $29.71 each starting in July 2016. As of \nSeptember 2017, the balance was $1,069. After a $30 payment in April 2018, he owed \n$856 on the account. (GEs 2-4; AE B; Tr. 25.) \n \nPast-due utility debt for $864 (SOR \u00b6 1.f) \n \n \nIn March 2017, Applicant\u2019s power supplier placed an $864 debt for collection. \nApplicant arranged to make an extra payment each month toward the delinquency with his \nregular bill payment. As of late March 2018, the balance under the repayment agreement \nwas $955. (GE 4; AE F; Tr. 29.) \n \nCollection debt for $626 (SOR \u00b6 1.g) \n \n \nIn September 2012, Applicant opened a credit card account with a retailer. As of \nApril 2014, his account was charged off and in collection for $626 due to no payments \nsince September 2013. Applicant asserts that the $75 monthly payment to the entity \ncollecting the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d also covers the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g. (GE 2; Tr. 28.) \nHowever, AE D shows that the full $75 payment is being credited toward the account in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant presented no documentation showing progress toward resolving the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.g, which had been charged off to profit and loss by the creditor. (GE 3.) \n \nCollection debt for $235 (SOR \u00b6 1.h) \n \n \nIn September 2015, a delinquent credit card balance of $585 for a computer was \nplaced for collection after inactivity since September 2014. Applicant began repaying the \ndebt at $25 a month in July 2016. He made extra payments when he could, and as of \nSeptember 2017, the balance was $235. As of late April 2018, the outstanding balance \nwas $34. (GEs 1-4; AE C.) \n \nCollection debt for $210 (SOR \u00b6 1.i) \n \n \nApplicant obtained a retail charge card in November 2008. His account was charged \noff and placed for collection for $420 due to nonpayment since September 2013. As of \nSeptember 2017, the account had a past-due balance of $210. The debt was fully satisfied \nwith a final payment of $70 received by the creditor on December 1, 2017. (GEs 3-4; AE A; \nTr. 24.) \n\n6 \n \n \nOn June 23, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an OPM investigator about the \ndelinquent accounts on his credit report and about his tax issues for 2012. He explained \nthat he did not realize he had any financial problems until he received a letter from the IRS \nin June 2015 stating that he owed $3,851 after an audit of his 2012 income tax return.5 He \ndid not understand why he owed taxes, and so he paid a $500 fee to a tax attorney to \nresolve the issue with the IRS and also any state tax issue for tax year 2012. He denied \nreceiving any notification from the state of a tax liability for 2012. After receiving notice of \nthe federal taxes, he obtained his credit report in 2016 and learned that several of his \naccounts were past-due. He allowed his spouse to use his credit cards, and she failed to \nadjust her spending in line with his lower salary. He did not dispute the debts with the \nexception of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i, which he did not recognize at the time. He indicated that \nhe immediately contacted his creditors and made repayment arrangements. Applicant \nadded that he and his spouse had taken several steps to resolve cash-flow issues and \nobtain the funds to pay off his past-due debts. They reduced their rent from $1,878 to \n$1,500 a month and lowered their utility costs by moving to a smaller apartment in June \n2016. With a change in cable television and Internet plans, they lowered that monthly \nexpense by $100 to $248. Additionally, his spouse obtained employment at an arcade that \nnetted income of $1,000 a month. They had $5,940 in monthly net household income to \npay expenses totaling $4,925, which did not include any payments to the IRS or on the \nstudent loan obtained by Applicant for their older son\u2019s education. (GE 2.) \n \n \nAfter about a year, the tax firm wanted another $800 from Applicant to resolve his \ntax issues. Dissatisfied with the firm because of a lack of communication from the firm, \nApplicant retained a local tax resolution entity that he found by a Google search. (Tr. 61.) \nHe paid the company\u2019s $2,500 retainer fee over time. He made a $625 payment in \nNovember 2017 to the company. (AE H; Tr. 33-34, 61.) \n \n \nOn November 1, 2017, Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories. He denied \nthat he had failed to file his federal and state income tax returns for 2012 on time, and he \ndenied the balances claimed by the IRS ($20,575) and the state ($3,934). Applicant \nprovided a document showing that he had purchased online tax software in 2013 to \nprepare his 2012 tax returns and explained in part: \n \nSince I started working I have always claimed zero dependents in my tax \npaperwork so that I would always receive tax money back. Typically this was \nin the three thousand dollar range with the Federal and state combined. \nWhen I learned in 2016 that there was some sort of issue I went to my home \ncomputer to obtain the 2012 tax information and it was the only year missing \nfrom my computer. I obtained a tax specialist online to rectify the situation. I \npaid the specialist their fee and they never seem to communicate what they \nwere doing or had done for the money I provided. I ended up changing to a \nlocal law firm who deals with these issues. . . . (GE 2.) \n                                                 \n5 The amount of federal tax liability is discrepant with what he reported on his SF 86, and with his testimony at \nhis hearing. When asked how he came up with the $23,000, he responded that he could not recall exactly the \nsource, although it was possibly the credit report, and that he \u201cjust added state and federal together.\u201d (Tr. 55.) \nHe could not recall the source of the $3,851 figure provided during his interview. (Tr. 60.) \n\n7 \n \n \nFor several months, the tax resolution firm claimed that it could clear up Applicant\u2019s \ntax issues in weeks. In approximately early March 2018, the state filed a lien against \nApplicant\u2019s bank account for past-due state taxes for 2012 (allegedly $3,934 as of August \n2017). It became clear to Applicant that the tax resolution company had made little \nprogress on his behalf. On the suggestion of one of his co-workers, Applicant and his \nspouse then had their joint federal and state income tax returns for 2012 prepared by a \nprofessional tax service. Three days later, and after paying a fee of $275, their tax returns \nfor 2012 were completed and filed on March 16, 2018. They owed $949 to the IRS and \n$2,174 to the state for tax year 2012. (AE J; Tr. 34-38, 58, 61-64.) \n \n \nAfter reviewing the return submitted in March 2018, the IRS recalculated their \nfederal income taxes for 2012, and instead of owing a balance of $18,865 Applicant and \nhis spouse were entitled to a refund of $1,361. (AE I.) The state suspended the levy \nagainst his bank account on receiving their state tax return but seized their federal refund \nfor $1,361. As of Applicant\u2019s hearing in May 2018, the state was still assessing their tax \nliability for tax year 2012. (Tr. 35-38, 72.) \n \n \nApplicant has been handling the household finances since mid-2016, when he \nlearned of his consumer credit delinquencies. (Tr. 40-41.) Applicant\u2019s two sons currently \nlive at home. His younger son was attending college as of May 2018. The other son had \ntemporarily withdrawn from school to pursue an entrepreneurial venture involving \npurchasing items on sale from retailers and sending them to Amazon for online resale. \nApplicant gave his son approximately $1,000 over time to facilitate this business venture. \n(Tr. 68-69.) As of late April 2018, Applicant was making monthly payments of $167 toward \nthe student loan obtained for his older son\u2019s education. The loan had a balance of $12,690. \n(AE E; Tr. 29, 73.) His sons have student loans of their own for which Applicant has no \ncontractual liability. (Tr. 73.) \n \n \nApplicant is paying his parents $300 a month toward the personal loan to pay off his \nvehicle. The remaining balance is approximately $6,000. Applicant and his spouse have no \nother vehicles. (Tr. 38, 65-66.) He intends to fully satisfy his outstanding debts. (Tr. 40.) \nApplicant\u2019s annual salary is currently $92,000. He has $1,200 in the bank, but no \nretirement funds. (Tr. 48, 66.) Applicant is currently disputing a $27 PayPal debt in \ncollections that he did not authorize. He is working with his insurance company to resolve \nan outstanding $199 medical debt. He maintains an Excel spreadsheet to track the \nhousehold income and expenditures. (Tr. 48-51.) \n  \n \nAt his annual performance review for the period from June 2017 through May 2017, \nApplicant was given excellent to outstanding ratings. He consistently displayed a positive \nattitude and willingness to do whatever was required by his team. (AE K.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \n\n8 \n \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \n\n9 \n \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nIn 2015 or 2016, the IRS notified Applicant and his spouse that they owed back \ntaxes for tax year 2012. Applicant was unable to confirm that he had filed federal and state \nincome tax returns for 2012, and the IRS and state tax authority filed substitute returns for \n2012. As of August 2017, Applicant had been assessed tax liabilities of apparently $20,575 \nby the IRS and of $3,934 by the state for tax year 2012. Applicant denied the debts when \nhe responded to DOHA interrogatories in November 2017 and when he responded to the \nSOR in December 2017. Under \u00b6 E3.1.14 of the Directive, the government has the burden \nof presenting evidence to establish controverted facts. In that regard, the total tax debt was \napproximately equivalent to the $23,000 tax liability Applicant listed on his SF 86 and was \nattempting to resolve. The IRS record from April 2018 indicated an account balance of \n$18,865 before the assessment of his return filed in mid-March 2018. There is no \ndocumentation from the state that reflects the balance alleged in SOR 1.b, but Applicant \nadmitted at his hearing that the state filed a lien against his bank account in approximately \nearly March 2018 for back taxes for 2012. There is sufficient evidence of failure to file a \ntimely state tax return and of past-due federal and state income taxes for 2012 to shift the \nburden to Applicant to demonstrate either that he is not responsible or that matters in \nmitigation apply.  \n \nMoreover, available credit reports establish that Applicant defaulted on the six \nconsumer accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.i. To his credit, after he learned about the \ndebts in 2016, he made repayment arrangements. By the time the SOR was issued in \nNovember 2017, he had reduced the delinquency balances from $6,625 to approximately \n$4,898. Even so, debts that have been charged off or placed for collection raise financial \nconsiderations security concerns. Applicant is not required to be debt free, but he is \nrequired to manage his finances in a way to exhibit sound judgment and responsibility. \nDisqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d 19(c), \u201ca history of not \n\n10 \n \nmeeting financial obligations,\u201d and 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, \nstate, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nas required,\u201d apply in this case.  \n \nThe burden is on Applicant to mitigate the evidence of financial delinquency and \nnoncompliance with tax filing and payment obligations. One or more of the following \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 may apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) has some applicability in that Applicant\u2019s tax problems were infrequent. \nWhether he failed to file or filed his return and it went missing, his tax filing problem \ninvolved only a single tax year. Most of his consumer credit accounts became delinquent in \n2013 and 2014 and so were not incurred recently. However, AG \u00b6 20(a) does not fully \napply because some of his debts, including his state tax liability for 2012, have not been \ncompletely resolved. The Appeal Board recently affirmed that unresolved debts are a \ncontinuing course of conduct. See ISCR Case No. 17-03146 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2018) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 15-08799 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2017)). \n \nApplicant has a credible case for mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b) in that the loss of his \njob in April 2011 was outside of his control. He secured his current employment within a \n\n11 \n \nmonth and was paid $20,000 in severance from his previous employer. However, his \nhousehold income was adversely impacted because his new job paid him $26,000 less a \nyear. Applicant cashed in his retirement fund, and although it had tax implications for tax \nyear 2012, it went toward his older son\u2019s college expenses and was not spent frivolously. \nUnbeknownst to Applicant at the time, his spouse failed to adjust her spending to account \nfor the decrease in his income. AG \u00b6 20(b) requires that an individual act responsibly, and \nsome concern arises in that regard because of Applicant\u2019s lack of oversight over his \nspouse\u2019s handling of their finances. However, when he learned about the debts, he acted \nresponsibly by entering into repayment plans with most of his creditors and making the \npromised payments. Applicant exercised questionable judgment by continuing to pay a \nsuccession of tax resolution companies that failed to show proof of progress toward \naddressing his tax matters. Yet, when it became obvious that little had been accomplished \non his behalf, he and his spouse filed their federal and state income tax returns with the \nassistance of a professional tax service in March 2018. \n \nAGs \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), 20(d), and 20(g) also have some applicability. Applicant and his \nspouse\u2019s federal income tax liability has been largely resolved with the filing of their return \nin March 2018, and the IRS\u2019 reassessment of their federal return resulting in a positive \noutcome for them. Instead of owing $18,865 in federal income taxes, they were entitled to \na $1,360 refund for tax year 2012. Regarding his consumer credit delinquency, Applicant \nhad satisfied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i, and through a track record of payments since July 2016 \nreduced his credit delinquency on other accounts to $3,840 as of May 2018. \n \nApplicant did not provide any evidence of payments toward the charged-off $626 \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.g. The $955 that remains on his installment plan with the power company \nexceeds the delinquency listed on his credit report as of September 2017, but his \nrepayment is acceptable to the creditor. Applicant\u2019s and his spouse\u2019s state tax liability has \nnot been resolved, but assuming the alleged balance of $3,934 and the state\u2019s interception \nof his $1,360 federal income tax refund for 2012, their remaining tax liability is \napproximately $2,575. It could be more or less depending on assets taken by the state \nfrom his bank account before Applicant and his spouse filed their tax return in mid-March \n2018 and on any penalties assessed by the state since August 2017. They also may owe \nnothing, especially if the state applies credits similar to the IRS. \n \nApplicant is not required to pay off every debt in the SOR to be granted security \nclearance eligibility. All that is required is that he has established a plan to resolve his \nfinancial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. See ISCR Case \nNo. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). When asked about new debts, Applicant \nvolunteered that he was disputing a $27 collection debt and $199 in medical debt. Even if it \nis determined that he is responsible for those debts, his overall debt burden is not likely to \nbe a source of financial pressure for him. He has been handing his family\u2019s finances since \nmid-2016, and has made the payments promised to his creditors on terms acceptable to \nthem. He is likely to continue to make those payments, provided he has the income to do \nso. The financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. \n\n12 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). The analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but \nsome warrant additional comment. \n \n \nThe security clearance adjudication involves an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in light of the security guidelines in the Directive. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). It is not a proceeding designed to \ncollect debts.  Applicant admits that he did not pay enough attention to his household \nfinances when his spouse was paying the bills. He still exhibits some lack of knowledge \nabout his car loan that he paid off with the funds borrowed from his mother in that he \nclaims that the debt was related to car that he traded in. He probably should have been \nmore proactive about pressing the tax resolution firms for some positive results on his tax \nissues. In his favor, Applicant has been reliable and trustworthy on the job, as evidenced \nby his ratings as an excellent, and, in some aspects, outstanding performer during the \nannual appraisal period that ended in May 2017. He took steps to ensure financial stability \ngoing forward by moving his family to a smaller apartment at lower rent and by changing \ntheir cable plan to save $100 a month in cable and Internet costs. His spouse gained \nemployment that brings in household income of $25,000 annually. While he and his \nspouse are not debt free, they are living within their means while continuing to address his \ndelinquent debts. After considering all the facts and circumstances, it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n \n \n_____________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 70-year-old senior principal engineering fellow with a defense contractor. He and his spouse are naturalized U.S. citizens who met and married in the United States. They had a daughter in 1977, who lived five years. They have two sets of twin daughters born in 1978 and in 1986, who are all married and successful college graduates. Applicant and his spouse have nine grandchildren. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 15, 64, 111, 115-120.) Applicant has worked for his defense-contractor employer (company X) most recently since March 1987. He previously worked for the company from 1979 to 1981. He has been at his current job location since 2015. (GE 1; Tr. 64-65.) He has a bachelor\u2019s degree earned in 1971, a master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering awarded in 1975, and a doctorate degree awarded in June 1979. Applicant was initially granted a DOD security clearance in 1979. His clearance was renewed in April 1987 for his work with company X, and he has held a Secret or Top Secret security clearance since then. (GEs 1-4.) His security clearance eligibility was last renewed in May 2015, when he was granted a Secret clearance. (GE 12.)

Temple, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant inadvertently violated security policies and procedures in May 1995 \nwhen he inserted in a memorandum technical information from which an engineer with \nknowledge could determine classified data. He caused spills of classified data in March \n2006, March 2013, August 2014, and November 2016, by emailing files with classified \ninformation to cleared co-workers via his company\u2019s unclassified network. Applicant was \nwell-intentioned, but the pattern of similar security incidents casts doubt about his \nsecurity worthiness. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 19, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline K, handling protected information, and explaining \nwhy it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue his access to classified information. The DOD CAF took the action under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \n12/11/2018\n\n2 \n \nthe National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn January 22, 2018, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA). On April 18, 2018, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing \nto determine whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant. On August 6, 2018, I scheduled a hearing \nfor September 18, 2018.  \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Seventeen Government exhibits (GEs 1-\n17) were admitted in evidence, which included reports of administrative inquiries into \nsecurity violations and written reprimands about which Applicant expressed some \nconcerns and objections. Two Applicant exhibits (AEs A-B) were admitted into \nevidence. Applicant, his spouse, and his son-in-law testified, as reflected in a transcript \n(Tr.) received on October 3, 2018.  \n \nSummary of SOR Allegations \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline K that Applicant risked a data spill by directing \nhis secretary to type a memorandum containing protected information on an \nunclassified computer in approximately May 1995, and that he did not inform security \nofficials of the potential data spill (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Applicant is also alleged under Guideline \nK to have improperly emailed a file containing protected information on an unclassified \nnetwork causing a data spill in about 1998 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), March 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), April \n2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.d), August 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.e), and November 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). \n \n \nIn a detailed response, Applicant denied that he deliberately violated security \nregulations in May 1995 because the Security Classification Guide (SCG) did not \nspecify that the technical information in his memo was classified. He acknowledged that \na chief systems engineer determined that the information could be used to figure out \nfrequency data, which was classified. Applicant admitted the security violations in 1998 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b) and March 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), but stated that he does not clearly recall the \nviolations. Although Applicant was alleged to have signed a letter acknowledging the \nApril 2013 security violation (SOR \u00b6 1.d), he denied the violation on the basis that the \nprotected information in his email was not classified in the SCG at the time. It was only \nafter he sent the email that a decision was made to treat the information as classified. \nApplicant also denied the August 2014 violation (SOR \u00b6 1.e), explaining that he had \nbeen asked for his input on a proposal. He cropped figures to remove classified values, \nbut in pasting the data, he used a destination style, not knowing that it would cause the \nclassified values to reappear. He denied any intention to share protected information. \nApplicant denied the November 2016 violation (SOR \u00b6 1.f), and indicated that he was \nasked to resolve an urgent problem within 24 hours and used an Excel document \nprovided by a company engineer years ago that unbeknownst to him was classified. He \ninadvertently included classified information in a PowerPoint document, which led \n\n3 \n \nsecurity officials to seize his work computer. All of the violations involved dissemination \nto authorized persons. (Answer.) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 70-year-old senior principal engineering fellow with a defense \ncontractor. He and his spouse are naturalized U.S. citizens who met and married in the \nUnited States. They had a daughter in 1977, who lived five years. They have two sets of \ntwin daughters born in 1978 and in 1986, who are all married and successful college \ngraduates. Applicant and his spouse have nine grandchildren. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 15, 64, 111, \n115-120.) \n \nApplicant has worked for his defense-contractor employer (company X) most \nrecently since March 1987. He previously worked for the company from 1979 to 1981. \nHe has been at his current job location since 2015. (GE 1; Tr. 64-65.) He has a \nbachelor\u2019s degree earned in 1971, a master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering awarded \nin 1975, and a doctorate degree awarded in June 1979. Applicant was initially granted a \nDOD security clearance in 1979. His clearance was renewed in April 1987 for his work \nwith company X, and he has held a Secret or Top Secret security clearance since then. \n(GEs 1-4.) His security clearance eligibility was last renewed in May 2015, when he was \ngranted a Secret clearance. (GE 12.) \n \nApplicant developed considerable technical expertise in his field during his more \nthan 30 years with his employer. He holds 21 U.S. patents with some work colleagues, \nincluding five patents granted since January 2016, and he has published 39 papers. \n(Answer; AE A; Tr. 16-17, 60.) He executed a classified information Non-Disclosure \nAgreement (Standard Form 312) with his employer on December 7, 1998. He had \nannual DOD security refresher briefings about his security responsibilities from at least \n2006 to as recently as January 2, 2018, as required by his employer,1 and annual \n                                                 \n1 The Government entered in evidence company X\u2019s security-indoctrination briefing as of 2016. (GE 15.) \nIndividuals are briefed on their responsibility to report to security any issues covered by the 13 \nadjudicative standards, including use of information technology systems. In that regard, employees are \ninformed to report any security violations that come to their attention, such as when \u201cclassified information \nis processed, manipulated, or stored on a computer not approved for classified processing (i.e., data \nspill).\u201d Those briefed are also informed of the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual \n(NISPOM), and are specifically advised that classified information must be accessed only by individuals \nwith an appropriate level of clearance and a valid need-to-know; kept under the control or guarded by an \nauthorized person or stored in a locked security container, vault, secure room or secured area and not left \nunattended; discussed in an area authorized for classified information or on a secure telephone; marked \nappropriately; transmitted via secure communications methods; processed on a computer or other \nequipment approved by the government; and destroyed by approved methods. They are informed that \nemployees with derivative classification authority are required to complete Derivative Classifier training \nevery two years. About classified information systems processing, they are briefed that DOD classified \ninformation may only be processed on information systems approved and accredited by the cognizant \nsecurity authority; that the use of personal laptops or other devices is prohibited; and that any classified \n\n4 \n \nclassified information system user briefings from 2013 through 2017.2 Applicant was \nalso given closed-area briefings in April 2009, September 2013, and November 2016.3 \nHe completed derivative classification briefings every two years between January 2014 \nand January 2018, which was required by his employer. (GEs 13, 17; Tr. 67-68, 76.) \nThe information in the briefings he had over the years remained substantially the same \nthroughout his tenure at company X. (Tr. 68.) Applicant\u2019s present desire and focus is to \nmentor younger engineers to boost his employer\u2019s technical contributions to the U.S. \nnational interest. (Tr. 59.) He has not previously had his security clearance eligibility \nquestioned despite some security violations on his record. The salient details of those \nviolations are as follows. \n \nMay 1995 violation (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \n \n \nWhile working as a principal engineer with a secret clearance in May 1995, \nApplicant created a six-page memorandum that was typed by his secretary in her office \nusing a dedicated computer that was not cleared for classified processing. The \nsecretary held a Secret clearance. The document, which was distributed to ten \nemployees of company X, was thought to be unclassified by Applicant based on his \ninterpretation of the SCG dated June 1992. Applicant was then the leading analyst on \nthe system, and he was asked to write a technical memorandum by the chief engineer, \nwho planned to use the memorandum to explain the system issue to a customer. (Tr. \n20.) On review of the memorandum in June 1995, a scientist on the program advised \nApplicant that he thought the memorandum should be classified at the Secret level due \nto the possibility that someone with sufficient knowledge could derive Secret information \nfrom the technical data in the memorandum. At Applicant\u2019s direction, his secretary \n                                                                                                                                                             \ninformation processing on a non-accredited system must be reported immediately to the facility security \nofficer or information systems security manager (ISSM). About computer data spills, which occurs when \nclassified data \u201cis accidentally processed, released or received on an unclassified PC (or associated \ndevices), network or voice mail,\u201d cleared employees are informed about the possible damage caused by \ndata spills, costs, and consequences for the offender. Employees are specifically advised to notify \nsecurity immediately in the case of a data spill and to know the SCG so as to avoid a data spill. \n \n2 Available documentation of company X\u2019s annual cybersecurity awareness training (GE 16) is dated May \n2018. All users of a classified information system are required to read and understand the company\u2019s \nsecurity plan and acknowledge their responsibilities. Current cybersecurity awareness training informs \ncleared company X employees that all media and systems must be conspicuously marked with the \nclassification level or labeled as unclassified, and that unclassified hardware cannot be used for classified \npurposes or as peripheral equipment on a classified information system at any time. Guidance in \npreventing data spills reminds the briefed employee that data by itself maybe unclassified but when \ncombined with other data may become classified and to ask a subject matter expert if unclear. \nInformation assurance personnel are to be notified when there is a classified data spill. The annual \ncybersecurity awareness training also reminds those employees who anticipate creating derivatively \nclassified material about the requirement to take Derivative Classifier training every two years. Applicant \nacknowledged that he received similar briefings before 2018. (Tr. 67.) \n  \n3 Available closed area-briefing documentation (GE 14) was published in 2016 and revised on June 21, \n2018. Under that guidance, closed areas are established to protect information systems processing \nclassified information and or classified information, which, due to their size and nature, cannot be stored \nin a secured container. The briefing provides that closed areas are generally not approved for open \nstorage of classified material. \n\n5 \n \nretrieved all of the distributed copies that she could before she left the company\u2019s \nemployment in late June 1995. The memorandum was taken to the classified \npublications area to have the classification marking changed from unclassified to \nSecret. Applicant did not report the incident to his security office. (GE 3; Tr. 71-73.)  \n \n \n In early August 1995, a Defense Investigative Service industrial security \nrepresentative (IS representative) conducted an inspection in the publications area at \nthe facility. She discovered two copies of the memorandum in a classified container that \nwas assigned to an employee with a Secret clearance. One copy was marked Secret \nand the other was marked unclassified. At the request of the IS representative, a \ncompany X security manager initiated an administrative inquiry (AI) to determine the \nreason for the difference in the classification of the memoranda. During the inquiry, \nApplicant admitted to the security manager that he had his then secretary type the \nmemorandum on her unclassified computer. He marked the document unclassified \nbased on his interpretation of the SCG, which he asserted did not identify the data as \nclassified. The security manager removed the affected computer and brought it to the \ndocument control station. Security then contacted the employees who had received the \ninitial memorandum. All of the employees held at least a Secret clearance. Six of the \ncopies were recovered. The other four copies, which were not marked, were discarded \nin company refuse. In reporting his findings of the AI in September 1995, the security \nmanager opined that because some copies of the document had been discarded, the \npossibility of compromise could not be ruled out. However, he also indicated that the \nclassified data that could have been derived from the parameters in Applicant\u2019s \nmemorandum was no longer classified as of mid-August 1995 based on the program\u2019s \nsecurity guide. Applicant was found culpable for the violation. He was issued a \nreprimand and re-briefed on his responsibility to promptly notify the security office of any \nfuture similar incidents. (GE 3; Tr. 20-21, 74.) \n \n \nIn early October 1995, the IS representative informed the security manager that \nshe was concerned about the failure of employees to notify their security officials when \nthe classification issue was presented, and about the inadequacy of the classification \nreview process before a document is released. Noting that several instances of \nclassification error had occurred with respect to the particular program, she \nrecommended that the employees on the program be briefed on their reporting \nrequirements with respect to classification errors, security violations, and computer \nsecurity. The IS representative noted that Applicant had his memorandum reviewed as \nrequired, and despite that fact, it was released as unclassified. Moreover, she noted that \nnone of the ten employees contacted by the secretary to retrieve the copies reported \nthe incident to security personnel. The IS representative notified the Defense Industrial \nSecurity Office of Applicant\u2019s culpability for the violation. (GE 3.) \n \n1998 violation (SOR \u00b6 1.b) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant caused a data spill by improperly emailing a file \ncontaining protected information via an unclassified network in about 1998, and that \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor advised him that he had committed a security violation. Applicant \n\n6 \n \nadmitted the allegation when he responded to the SOR, but he also indicated that he \nhad no recall of the incident. The allegation may well stem from Applicant\u2019s voluntary \ndisclosure during his October 2013 subject interview that he had a committed a security \nviolation prior to the 2013 violation. He indicated that it occurred approximately 15 years \nago, which would have been 1998 as of his 2013 interview. He explained that he sent \nan email to a chief engineer, which included a Word document containing classified \ninformation, but there was no clear classification guidance. (GE 2.) Applicant appears to \nhave been discussing the 2006 violation, which involved the same named engineer. At \nhis hearing, Applicant reiterated that he had no recollection of any security incident in \n1998. (Tr. 77.) The evidence falls short of establishing that Applicant violated security \npractices and procedures in 1998.  \n \nMarch 2006 violation (SOR \u00b6 1.c) \n \n \nIn mid-March 2006, Applicant and a colleague at company X prepared a \nPowerPoint presentation for a symposium to be held in May 2006 on a design they had \ncreated. Applicant marked up a hard copy of the presentation by changing one word on \nthe title page. The word was considered classified at the Secret level. Applicant\u2019s \ncolleague made the change to an electronic copy of the PowerPoint presentation saved \non his laptop before emailing the updated PowerPoint presentation to Applicant. Six \ndays later, Applicant sent emails to his colleague and five other co-workers with the \ncontaminated PowerPoint presentation attached. One of the co-workers who had read \nthe attachment notified the program security manager of the security violation. A \ncompany X information systems security manager (ISSM) immediately conducted an AI. \nEfforts were then taken to delete the emails and wipe the contaminated file from the \naffected computer drives. Email server backup tapes were removed and taken to \ndocument control at another company X facility. Applicant had printed the document to \na printer in another building and had stored it in his locked office. The first page was \nremoved and turned into document control. As required by \u00b6\u00b6 1-303 and 8-100 of the \nNISPOM, the ISSM notified the Defense Security Service (DSS) of the results of the AI. \nThe ISSM concluded that compromise had occurred because Secret information \nresided on an unclassified email server and on unclassified computers for ten days. \nApplicant was found culpable of an inadvertent security violation for transmitting an \nemail that contained classified information. He was issued a written reprimand per \ncompany X\u2019s security standards and procedures for a first non-deliberate security \nviolation in a 12-month period.4 He was advised that any further violation within the next \n12 months would result in further disciplinary action ranging from five days unpaid \nsuspension to termination of employment. He also re-briefed about his responsibilities \nto be knowledgeable of the procedures for safeguarding classified information. After the \n                                                 \n4 Under its security enterprise standard, company X has a graduated scale of disciplinary action for a \nfailure to adhere to established security rules and regulations. A written reprimand is issued for a first \noffense. For a second offense within a 12-month period, the discipline is suspension without pay for one \nto five days. For a third offense within a 12-month period, the discipline is suspension without pay for six \nto ten days up to and including employment termination. (GE 15.) \n  \n\n7 \n \nincident, company X realized that the work on the specific project needed to be \ncompleted in a closed area. (GEs 4-5; Tr. 81-83, 85.)  \n \n \nOn August 12, 2009, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for \nthe Office of Personnel Management (OPM). He volunteered that he had been cited for \nthe March 2006 security violation for accidentally transmitting an email that contained \ninformation that was not classified by the DOD but was considered classified \ninformation by the chief engineer on the project. He indicated that he had received a \nwritten warning, but it was an internal violation. When interviewed by an OPM \ninvestigator in October 2013, Applicant explained about the incident that it was not clear \nin the SCG that the information was classified. He was re-interviewed in November \n2013 for further details about that incident and about the security violation in 2013. He \nexplained about the 2006 incident that he sent the email not knowing that it contained \nclassified information. (GE 2.) Applicant testified at his hearing that the word he added \nbecame classified in context, i.e., put together with the program name. Applicant now \nunderstands that he should have had the document reviewed by the government \nprogram officer before dissemination. He asserted he is currently following that practice. \n(Tr. 80-81.) \n \nApril 2013 violation (SOR \u00b6 1.d)5 \n \n \nOn March 18, 2013, Applicant sent an unsecure email with an attached \nPowerPoint file containing data relating to three classified programs to four company X \nemployees at two different facilities. The next day, one of the recipients, an electrical \nengineering manager with a Top Secret clearance, notified company X security that \nthere was a possible issue with an email received from Applicant. On notification, the \nattached file was reviewed for classification by the manager and a subject matter expert \nwith a Secret clearance. The aggregation of the data with the programs\u2019 names made \nthe PowerPoint classified to the Secret level. Cleanup actions were taken, including \ndelivering the email server and file-share backup tapes to document control. Applicant \nshowed his ISSM where the contaminated file was located on his hard drive, and it was \nremoved. He admitted that he had printed the document, and the hard drive for the \naffected printer was removed for destruction. In reporting the results of his AI to the \nDSS in accord with \u00b6\u00b6 1-303 and 8-100 of the NISPOM, a security manager concluded \nthat a loss of classified information was assumed based on the fact that classified \ninformation resided on an unsecured network for four days. Applicant was identified as \nthe culpable employee. On April 8, 2013, he was issued a written warning for \ninadvertently publishing information that was determined to be classified onto \nunclassified systems. Applicant was advised that, as an engineer who develops or \nformulates data in support of classified programs, it was vital for him to understand the \ncustomer\u2019s SCG. In late June 2017, the DOD CAF was notified of Applicant\u2019s security \nviolation. (GEs 6-8; Tr. 83-84.) Applicant removed himself from working on the program \ninvolving co-sites to minimize the risk of another data spill. (Tr. 86-87.) \n \n                                                 \n5 The AI\u2019s findings indicate that the violation occurred on March 18, 2013, and not in April 2013. (GE 6.) \n\n8 \n \n \nDuring his October 2013 interview with an OPM investigator, Applicant \nvolunteered about the incident that he had performed an analysis of a system for a \nclient as a favor. He emailed on an unclassified network two files consisting of a \nPowerPoint presentation and a spreadsheet to some company X employees with \nsecurity clearance. He stated that because he emailed the files together, they were \nconsidered classified by aggregation. Applicant indicated that he cooperated with the \ncompany\u2019s investigation and acknowledged in writing his violation of a security policy. \nApplicant denied receiving any remedial security education as a result of the incident. \nHe kept his same job assignment but was told that there would be a serious penalty, \nsuch as a reduction in salary, for another security infraction. When re-interviewed in \nNovember 2013, Applicant explained that he was working on a proposal and not an \nestablished program, so there was no closed room where he could handle the classified \ndata. He did not realize that by sending the two files at the same time, the data when \naggregated became classified. Applicant explained to an OPM investigator in August \n2017 that the chief engineer had not properly briefed him about the project. He learned \nfrom the incident to ask those working on the project to review information for its \nclassification level before any dissemination, especially for a proposal that does not \nhave a SCG. Applicant also realized that he should have met with the chief engineer in \nperson to discuss the solution rather than send an email.  (GE 2.) Applicant asserts that \nhe could not have known that by aggregating the data about three programs it became \nclassified, and that the systems engineer in charge of implementation bears some \nresponsibility for not giving him proper guidance about the classification issue.6 (Tr. 43-\n44.) \n \nAugust 2014 violation (SOR \u00b6 1.e) \n \n \nOn August 6, 2014, Applicant sent an email with a PowerPoint attachment to two \nwork colleagues with Secret clearances. He sent a separate email containing a different \nversion of the PowerPoint file to a recipient of the first email and to two additional \ncleared colleagues. Under the SCG for the program at issue, the PowerPoint contained \ndata classified at the Secret level. The employee that received the two emails notified \nhis security manager, and corrective action was taken immediately to secure printed \ncopies of the PowerPoint presentation and remove and wipe the affected computers \nand hard drives. Applicant was removed from the affected program and issued a written \nwarning letter in which he was advised that since the Secret data was sent over the \nInternet, it was deemed a compromise of classified information. As required by \u00b6\u00b6 1-303 \nand 8-100 of the NISPOM, DSS was informed of the violation in a report dated \nSeptember 4, 2014. Based on the fact that classified information resided on an \nunsecured network from August 5, 2014, to August 6, 2014, a company X security \nmanager advised the DSS that it must be assumed that a loss of classified information \noccurred. Applicant was identified as the culpable individual. (GEs 9-10; Tr. 92-93.) \n \n                                                 \n6 Applicant provided details of the April 2013 security incident when stating his concerns regarding GE 5, \nwhich is the written warning issued to him for a non-deliberate violation in March 2006. He provided \ndetails of the August 2014 security incident when stating his concerns about GE 6, which is his \nemployer\u2019s findings of the April 2013 violation. \n\n9 \n \n \nWhen interviewed by an OPM investigator in August 2017, Applicant explained \nthat he created a scale diagram to solve a problem related to a company X proposal. \nApplicant knew that the numbers on the side of the scale were classified, and so he \ncropped the numbers before sending a graph diagram by email to other company X \nemployees. One of the recipients noticed that if he clicked the diagram, the picture \nreverted to the previous version containing Secret information. Applicant acknowledged \nhe was at fault for the violation, which he attributed to rushing to send the solution while \nworking on three projects simultaneously. There was no SCG for Applicant to review \nbecause the project was in the proposal phase. Applicant now understands that he \nshould have double-checked the diagram before emailing it and that he should have \nsent the email via company X\u2019s classified network. Applicant related that he has taken \ncorrective action to preclude a recurrence by having those working on a project to \nconfirm the security classification level. (GE 2.) He also has a colleague review his \nemails before sending them, and any attachments are now in PDF format. (Tr. 91-92.) \nApplicant attributes the violation to him not knowing that the full image with the \nclassified information was recoverable. He asserts that company X should have \nprovided him access to a closed area to process the classified image. (Tr. 45-46, 87-\n90.) \n \nNovember 2016 violation (SOR \u00b6 1.f) \n \n \nIn response to a company X customer inquiry, Applicant prepared a PowerPoint \npresentation diagnosing a technical issue for a deployed system. He included technical \nspecifications that were classified Confidential under the program\u2019s SCG. Applicant \nobtained the technical specifications from an Excel spreadsheet provided to him in 2009 \nby a co-worker who then separated from company X in 2012.7 Applicant had saved the \nspreadsheet on his work computer. In early November 2016, Applicant emailed the \nPowerPoint presentation to an engineering fellow with a Secret clearance at his facility \nand to two company X employees at another facility: a senior principal mechanical \nengineer with a Secret clearance who reported the incident to her ISSM and an \nengineering fellow with a Top Secret clearance, who as a subject matter expert \nconfirmed the classification level. ISSMs at both facilities coordinated the collection and \ncleanup of impacted assets in accord with the company\u2019s data spill response guide. \nApplicant was deemed responsible for the violation. In reporting the violation to the DSS \nin accord with \u00b6 1-303 of the NISPOM, the ISSM at Applicant\u2019s facility concluded that \nclassified information was compromised because classified information had been \nincluded on an information system not approved for classified processing. (GEs 11-12.) \n \n \nAn incident report was filed with the DOD CAF about Applicant\u2019s security \nviolation. (GE 12.) In late November 2016, company X filed a subsequent incident report \nnotifying the DOD CAF that the November 2016 incident was Applicant\u2019s fourth security \nviolation since 2006. In December 2016, the company notified the DOD CAF that the \nExcel spreadsheet containing classified specifications had resided on Applicant\u2019s \n                                                 \n7 There is no indication that the spreadsheet was conspicuously marked with its classification level, \nalthough the technical information was identified as classified in the program\u2019s SCG. \n \n\n10 \n \nunclassified computer since 2009, and the contaminated email was on unclassified \nemail servers and recipient systems for approximately 24 hours. Therefore, it was \ndetermined that a loss of classified information had occurred. Applicant was counseled \nthat it was critical to periodically review files for classified information before \ndissemination. (GE 12.) \n \n \nApplicant explained to an OPM investigator in August 2017 that his supervisor \nneeded him to troubleshoot a problem on an emergency basis. Applicant was his \ncompany\u2019s subject matter expert on a component. Applicant created a PowerPoint slide \npresentation outlining the steps he took to resolve the problem and sent it by email to \nsome company X employees. The following morning, he was told that he had included \n\u201cSecret\u201d information in the PowerPoint presentation.8 Applicant explained that the \nclassified information consisted of an item that was deemed classified by the project\u2019s \nchief engineer. Applicant denied knowing that the new number was classified. He \nasserted to company X security personnel that he should have been provided the SCG \nbecause he was not privy to all of the classification specifications. Applicant detailed his \ndiscipline for the violation, which consisted of one week of suspension without pay, \nwhich he served in February 2017; inability for a pay increase in 2017; and a reduction \nby half of his 2016 bonus. He was required to complete a security clearance application \n(SF 86) immediately, which prompted the background investigation. (GE 2; Tr. 97-98.) \n \n \nAbout lessons learned, Applicant admitted that he should have asked for the \nproject\u2019s SCG before working on the problem and emailing the PowerPoint. Regarding \ncorrective actions for the future, he expressed his intention to document his work in \nhardcopy first for the chief engineer to determine its classification level; to not send any \nelectronic copy without first having it reviewed; and to take more time to review the SCG \nrather than rush to show that he had solved a problem. Applicant acknowledged his \nculpability for the violation in that he was negligent in not reviewing the SCG on the \nproject. He stated that he does not believe classified information was compromised \nbecause the PowerPoint was sent only to company X employees and the information \nstayed within company X\u2019s computer systems network. Applicant displayed remorse \nover his violations and appeared motivated to follow proper security protocols in the \nfuture because he plans on retiring in the next few years and does not want to \njeopardize his career or future retirement benefits. (GE 2.) Applicant accepts \nresponsibility for the violation. He had received the Excel spreadsheet in an unclassified \nformat and had not known that the Excel spreadsheet contained classified information. \n(Tr. 48, 93-97.) After the incident, he obtained the SCG for the program so that he could \nuse it as guidance in performing maintenance to modernize the system. (Tr. 96.) \n \n \nApplicant attributes all of his security violations to the \u201cgray environment\u201d when \nthe projects were in the development stage, and the SCG was not clearly defined. He \nlacked any deliberate intention to compromise classified information, which was \ndisseminated through emails to company X employees authorized to receive the \ninformation. He asserts that the lead system engineers on the projects and the DOD \nbear some responsibility for his security violations in that he should have been provided \n                                                 \n8 The report of the AI indicates that the material was classified, but at the Confidential level. (GE 11.) \n\n11 \n \na clear and updated SCG. He submits that in all cases, he was the only company X \nemployee who fully understood the system\u2019s operation, which placed pressure on him to \nresolve the issues quickly and report progress to lead systems engineers outside of his \ndepartment. (Tr. 17-19, 42.) \n \n \nApplicant has continued to provide timely and effective solutions to a wide \nassortment of complex problems for his employer. He is highly respected by systems \nengineers and his peers at work. (AE B.) He is currently working on a program to \nimprove U.S. defense capability and plans to retire in two years. (Tr. 59, 61.) He \nmentors two employees who use his mathematical model to process classified data in a \nclosed area. (Tr. 71, 99-100.) He has not committed any security violations since \nNovember 2016. (Tr. 98.)  \n \n \nApplicant has an active role in his church\u2019s leadership. He became an elder in \n1999, has mentored church members looking for employment, and is involved in a \nsearch for a new pastor. He and his spouse counsel couples with troubled marriages \nand parents with troubled children. (Tr. 16, 107, 111-112.) \n \n \nOne of Applicant\u2019s sons-in-law testified for him. This son-in-law is a licensed \nattorney who has stayed at home to care for his and his spouse\u2019s three children since \n2010. (Tr. 104.) Based on his review of the SOR and discussions with Applicant, he \nbelieves the incidents occurred when Applicant was working on projects outside of his \ngroup where he did not fully understand the rules. He considers Applicant \u201can upright \nman of integrity who has noble intentions and always tries to do the right thing.\u201d (Tr. \n106-107.)  Applicant has always been generous and fair with his time and attention. (Tr. \n110-111.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a \nsecurity clearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. \nIn addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are \nrequired to be considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative \ngoal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \n\n12 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government \nmust present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven \nby Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to \nobtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information \n \n \nThe security concern for handling protected information is articulated in AG \u00b6 33: \n \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information\u2014which includes classified and other \nsensitive government information, and proprietary information\u2014raises \ndoubt about an individual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or \nwillingness and ability to safeguard such information, and is a serious \nsecurity concern. \n \n \nIn May 1995, Applicant inadvertently violated those security procedures that \nrequire processing of classified information on approved equipment and marking of \nclassified information with its appropriate classification level. He created a technical \nmemorandum, which he marked and treated as unclassified based on his interpretation \nof the SCG. He had a secretary type the memorandum on her unclassified computer, \nand he disseminated ten copies internally to co-workers before learning that the \ndocument should have been marked Secret because an engineer with knowledge could \nascertain classified data from the information. On being advised that the document \nshould have been treated as Secret, he asked his secretary to retrieve the copies he \n\n13 \n \nhad disseminated, but he did not report the incident to security officials. His \nnoncompliance with his reporting obligation may well have led to compromise. Secret \ninformation was unprotected until August 1995, when the issue was discovered by a \nDIS representative during an inspection. Four unmarked copies of his memorandum \nwere apparently discarded as trash. More recently, Applicant caused spills of Secret \nclassified data in March 2006, March 2013, and August 2014, and of Confidential \nclassified data November 2016, when he sent emails with attachments that contained \nthe classified information to other employees on a company information system not \napproved for classified processing or transmission. In August 2014, he apparently \ntransmitted classified data over the Internet. \n \n \nRegarding disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 34(a), \u201cdeliberate or negligent disclosure \nof protected information to unauthorized persons, including, but not limited to, personal \nor business contacts, the media, or persons present at seminars, meetings, or \nconferences,\u201d Applicant did not set out to disclose or release classified information to \npersons unauthorized to receive it. The recipients of his emails containing classified \nattachments in 2006, 2013, 2014, and 2016 were all cleared employees of company X \nwho were authorized to receive the information. At the same time, compromise cannot \nbe completely ruled out because the classified information was sent as attachment by \nemail on an unapproved computer system. Four copies of his improperly marked as \nunclassified memorandum in 1995 were not recoverable because they were discarded \nas ordinary trash. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 34(b), \u201ccollecting or storing protected information in any unauthorized \nlocation,\u201d and AG \u00b6 34(c), \u201cloading, drafting, editing, modifying, storing, transmitting, or \notherwise handling protected information, including images, on any unauthorized \nequipment or medium,\u201d apply in that Applicant caused classified information to reside on \nunapproved network systems or computers for varying periods depending on the \nviolation. Regarding the March 2006 violation, Applicant kept a printed copy of the \nPowerPoint presentation in his locked office. The Excel spreadsheet from which he \nobtained Confidential technical information for his November 2016 PowerPoint \npresentation resided from 2009 to November 2016 on Applicant\u2019s computer not \nauthorized for classified processing or storage. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 34(g), \u201cany failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or \nsensitive information,\u201d is clearly established. Moreover, AG \u00b6 34(h), \u201cnegligence or lax \nsecurity practices that persist despite counseling by management,\u201d applies because of \nthe pattern of data spills between March 2006 and November 2016 that probably could \nhave been avoided had Applicant reviewed the appropriate SCGs or consulted with \nprogram experts and engineers about the classification level of the data before \ntransmitting it by email over an unapproved network. He had annual security refresher \nand cybersecurity awareness security briefings since 2006, which alerted him about \ndata spills and how to avoid them. Moreover, after the March 2006 incident, he was re-\nbriefed about his responsibilities to knowledgeable of and safeguard classified \ninformation. After the April 2013 violation, he was advised that, as an engineer who \ndevelops or formulates data in support of classified programs, it was vital for him to \n\n14 \n \nunderstand the SCG. He did not have an SCG available for review concerning the data \ninvolved in the August 2014 incident, but he admitted that he should have those working \non the proposal to review his email and attachment before sending it. He certainly \nrisked a data spill with respect to sending unmarked classified information via the \nInternet. The failure of a former co-worker to appropriately mark an Excel spreadsheet \nas classified was a significant factor in Applicant\u2019s November 2016 security violation, his \nfourth in little more than a decade. At the same time, Applicant let his desire to provide a \nquick solution to the problem dictate his actions. He acknowledges that he should have \nreviewed the SCG for the program. \n \n \nApplicant has the burden of mitigating the security concerns raised by his \nrepeated noncompliance with the rules and regulations for handling protected \ninformation. Applicant\u2019s failure to follow security guidelines on which he was trained \nsince 2006 is difficult to fully mitigate under AG \u00b6 35(a), even if it may reasonably be \nconsidered infrequent when considering his many years of holding a DOD clearance \nwithout any security violations or infractions. AG \u00b6 35(a) provides: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n \nAlbeit belatedly, Applicant exhibits some mitigation under AG \u00b6 35(b), \u201cthe \nindividual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security training and now \ndemonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of security responsibilities.\u201d \nApplicant has removed himself from working on a classified program involving co-site \nissues involved in the 2013 violation because of the complexity, which he does not feel \nhe can handle. He indicated in August 2017 that he learned from the 2013 incident to \nhave those familiar with the projects review information for its classification level before \nhe makes any dissemination. After the November 2016 incident, he expressed his \nintention to document his work in hardcopy so that the chief engineer could determine \nits classification level; to refrain from sending any electronic copy until it is reviewed; \nand to take more time and care in reviewing the applicable SCG. These are all \nfavorable steps which, if followed, will go a long way toward preventing a recurrence of \nany security violations similar to those he committed since 2006. He testified, with no \nevidence to the contrary, that he has not had any security infractions since November \n2016. However, Applicant continues to downplay his culpability for the security \ninfractions to the extent that he blames other engineers for not advising him of the \nsecurity classification and, in some cases, for placing unreasonable expectations on him \nto solve a problem. \n \n \nOn unfamiliar programs or programs in the proposal stage, he understandably \nmay not have recognized the information as classified, especially when data became \nclassified by aggregation. AG \u00b6 35(c), \u201cthe security violations were due to improper or \ninadequate training or unclear instructions,\u201d would have some applicability to the May \n1995 and April 2013 violations. Applicant was the leading analyst on the system \n\n15 \n \ninvolved in May 1995, but the IS representative who discovered the violation indicated \nthat there had been several classification errors on the program. Applicant had his \nmemorandum reviewed as required, and despite that fact, the memorandum was \nreleased as unclassified. Presumably the reviewer did not recognize that the data as \nclassified. The April 2013 violation involved three classified programs, and was at the \nproposal stage. The August 2014 violation occurred because Applicant did not \nunderstand the computer program he used to crop classified numbers from a graph \ndiagram. The technical specifications improperly transmitted in the November 2016 \nincident were classified Confidential in the SCG. Applicant relied to his detriment on an \nimproperly marked Excel spreadsheet for the data. Even so, as a longtime cleared \nemployee, Applicant can reasonably be held to have understood security practices and \nprocedures and the importance of ensuring that no classified information was divulged \nimproperly. His lack of due care in discharging his security responsibilities cannot \ncompletely be explained by inadequate training or instructions. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s violations were inadvertent, but in each case, they were discovered \nand reported by someone other than Applicant. Moreover, compromise was assumed in \nthe data spill incidents. AG \u00b6 35(d), \u201cthe violation was inadvertent, it was promptly \nreported, there is no evidence of compromise, and it does not suggest a pattern,\u201d is not \nmitigating of the security concerns. Applicant\u2019s commission of four serious security \nviolations since 2006 continues to cast some doubt about his ability to handle classified \ninformation appropriately. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct \nand all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at \nAG \u00b6 2(d).9 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s value to his employer and to the national defense effort is undisputed. \nHe holds some 21 patents on systems vital to the Nation\u2019s defense. I do not doubt that \nhe has personal integrity. He did not plan to violate security regulations. He held a \nsecurity clearance for years with only one violation before 2006, but it makes his lack of \ndue diligence in carrying out his security responsibilities in recent years all the more \ntroubling. It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a \nsecurity clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). Based \n                                                 \n9 The factors under AG \u00b6 2(d) are as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding \nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n\n16 \n \non the facts and circumstances before me, for the reasons noted above, I do not find it \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility at this time. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline K:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.f: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

The action was \ntaken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD for SORs issued \nafter June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR (Answer) on December 19, 2017, originally \nrequesting this matter be determined without a hearing. As a result, a File of Relevant \nMaterial (FORM) was submitted by the Government on March 1, 2018. Applicant \nresponded to the FORM on April 8, 2018. (Response) However, on June 15, 2018, \nApplicant requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to \nme on June 19, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nnotice of hearing on August 8, 2018, scheduling the hearing for August 22, 2018. The \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nhearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through \n4, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf and \npresented two documents, which I marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AppXs) A and B. The \nrecord was left open until November 26, 2018, for receipt of additional documentation. \nOn October 22, 2018, and on November 21, 2018, respectively, Applicant offered AppXs \nC and D, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (TR) on September 4, 2018. \n \n \nOn December 26, 2018, the undersigned issued a Decision denying Applicant \nnational security eligibility for access to sensitive information. I considered Applicant\u2019s \nResponse in rendering my Decision. On April 1, 2019, the Honorable Appeal Board \nremanded that Decision to the undersigned \u201cto give the parties a chance to offer the \nResponse or object to its admission as appropriate.\u201d On May 22, 2019, the undersigned \nissued an Order On Remand in compliance with the Appeal Board\u2019s instructions. On May \n31, 2019, Department Counsel offered said Response into evidence. (Post-Hearing \nExhibit (PHX) 1.) On June 4, 2019, Applicant\u2019s Counsel did not object to the admission of \nthe Response into evidence, and further offered Applicant\u2019s budget into evidence. (PHX \n2.) On June 17, 2019, Department Counsel objected to the admission of said budget. \n(PHX 3.) Pursuant to the Directive\u2019s Additional Procedural Guidance E3.1.10., said \nbudget is admitted into evidence as AppX E. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations set forth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.d, with \nexplanations. She denied SOR \u00b6 1.a.   \n \nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations \n \n \nApplicant is 49 years old, married and has two adult children. (GX 1 at pages 5 \nand 18, and TR at page 16 lines 4~13.) \n \n \n1.a. Applicant denies that she has a Federal tax lien, in the amount of about \n$30,000, entered against her and her husband in February of 2015. She avers that, as \nshe now files separate tax returns from her husband, she is not responsible for his tax \ndelinquencies. (TR at page 16 line 14 to page 21 line 20.) However, at her hearing \nApplicant also acknowledged her responsibility, as they owed back taxes, in part, as a \nresult of their 2012 joint tax return filing. (Id, and Response at page 6.) Applicant also \nnoted in her Response that her husband had intermittent tax levies filed against his \nseparate Federal tax returns. (Response at pages 3 and 4.) At her hearing, Applicant \naverred that she would submit further documentation showing that her spouse is now \npaying $833, biweekly, to the Internal Revenue Service towards this tax lien. (TR at page \n18 lines 1~18.) Despite having more than five months to submit said documentation, \nApplicant has only submitted a budget showing that no federal taxes are being paid. \n(AppX E at page 1.) This allegation is found against Applicant. \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \n \n1.b.~1.d.  Applicant admits that she is indebted to the Navy Federal Credit Union \nfor past-due debts totaling about $80,000. (TR at page 21 line 21 to page 26 line 19.) \nApplicant has submitted documentation showing she has begun to make monthly \npayments of $600 towards these admitted debts. (AppXs C and D.) I find she is making \na good-faith effort to address these credit union debts; and as such, these allegations are \nfound for Applicant.    \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of \ntrust. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n  \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. According to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he applicant \nis responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable [trustworthiness] decision.\u201d \n \n \nA person applying for a position of trust seeks to enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship transcends \nnormal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government reposes a \nhigh degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national security \neligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \n7 of EO 10865: \u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a \ndetermination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination \nas to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\n \n \nThe trustworthiness concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations \nare set out in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns and \nmay be disqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) . . . failure to pay annual Federal . . . income tax as required. \n \n \nApplicant had significant credit union delinquencies, and has a significant Federal \ntax lien. The evidence raises the above trustworthiness concerns, thereby shifting the \nburden to Applicant to rebut, extenuate, or mitigate those concerns.  \n \n \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate \ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial problems: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \n. . . to pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements. \n \n \nAlthough Applicant is addressing the credit union debt, she has yet to address the \n$30,000 Federal tax lien. This guideline is found against Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has yet to address her \nsignificant Federal tax lien.

The action was \ntaken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD for SORs issued \nafter June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR (Answer) on December 19, 2017, originally \nrequesting this matter be determined without a hearing. As a result, a File of Relevant \nMaterial (FORM) was submitted by the Government on March 1, 2018. Applicant \nresponded to the FORM on April 8, 2018. (Response) However, on June 15, 2018, \nApplicant requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to \nme on June 19, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nnotice of hearing on August 8, 2018, scheduling the hearing for August 22, 2018. The \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nhearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through \n4, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf and \npresented two documents, which I marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AppXs) A and B. The \nrecord was left open until November 26, 2018, for receipt of additional documentation. \nOn October 22, 2018, and on November 21, 2018, respectively, Applicant offered AppXs \nC and D, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (TR) on September 4, 2018. \n \n \nOn December 26, 2018, the undersigned issued a Decision denying Applicant \nnational security eligibility for access to sensitive information. I considered Applicant\u2019s \nResponse in rendering my Decision. On April 1, 2019, the Honorable Appeal Board \nremanded that Decision to the undersigned \u201cto give the parties a chance to offer the \nResponse or object to its admission as appropriate.\u201d On May 22, 2019, the undersigned \nissued an Order On Remand in compliance with the Appeal Board\u2019s instructions. On May \n31, 2019, Department Counsel offered said Response into evidence. (Post-Hearing \nExhibit (PHX) 1.) On June 4, 2019, Applicant\u2019s Counsel did not object to the admission of \nthe Response into evidence, and further offered Applicant\u2019s budget into evidence. (PHX \n2.) On June 17, 2019, Department Counsel objected to the admission of said budget. \n(PHX 3.) Pursuant to the Directive\u2019s Additional Procedural Guidance E3.1.10., said \nbudget is admitted into evidence as AppX E. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations set forth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.d, with \nexplanations. She denied SOR \u00b6 1.a.   \n \nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations \n \n \nApplicant is 49 years old, married and has two adult children. (GX 1 at pages 5 \nand 18, and TR at page 16 lines 4~13.) \n \n \n1.a. Applicant denies that she has a Federal tax lien, in the amount of about \n$30,000, entered against her and her husband in February of 2015. She avers that, as \nshe now files separate tax returns from her husband, she is not responsible for his tax \ndelinquencies. (TR at page 16 line 14 to page 21 line 20.) However, at her hearing \nApplicant also acknowledged her responsibility, as they owed back taxes, in part, as a \nresult of their 2012 joint tax return filing. (Id, and Response at page 6.) Applicant also \nnoted in her Response that her husband had intermittent tax levies filed against his \nseparate Federal tax returns. (Response at pages 3 and 4.) At her hearing, Applicant \naverred that she would submit further documentation showing that her spouse is now \npaying $833, biweekly, to the Internal Revenue Service towards this tax lien. (TR at page \n18 lines 1~18.) Despite having more than five months to submit said documentation, \nApplicant has only submitted a budget showing that no federal taxes are being paid. \n(AppX E at page 1.) This allegation is found against Applicant. \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \n \n1.b.~1.d.  Applicant admits that she is indebted to the Navy Federal Credit Union \nfor past-due debts totaling about $80,000. (TR at page 21 line 21 to page 26 line 19.) \nApplicant has submitted documentation showing she has begun to make monthly \npayments of $600 towards these admitted debts. (AppXs C and D.) I find she is making \na good-faith effort to address these credit union debts; and as such, these allegations are \nfound for Applicant.    \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of \ntrust. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n  \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. According to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he applicant \nis responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable [trustworthiness] decision.\u201d \n \n \nA person applying for a position of trust seeks to enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship transcends \nnormal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government reposes a \nhigh degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national security \neligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \n7 of EO 10865: \u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a \ndetermination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination \nas to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\n \n \nThe trustworthiness concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations \nare set out in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns and \nmay be disqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) . . . failure to pay annual Federal . . . income tax as required. \n \n \nApplicant had significant credit union delinquencies, and has a significant Federal \ntax lien. The evidence raises the above trustworthiness concerns, thereby shifting the \nburden to Applicant to rebut, extenuate, or mitigate those concerns.  \n \n \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate \ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial problems: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \n. . . to pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements. \n \n \nAlthough Applicant is addressing the credit union debt, she has yet to address the \n$30,000 Federal tax lien. This guideline is found against Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has yet to address her \nsignificant Federal tax lien. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with doubt as to \nApplicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, eligibility, and suitability for a position of trust. She failed \nto meet her burden to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns raised under the guidelines \nfor financial considerations. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n             AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph: 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n                    \n                    Subparagraphs 1.b.~1.d.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n          \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.

He explained he was having a relationship with another military member, \nand they were both married.1  \n \n \nApplicant admitted that in October 2015, he was terminated from his position as a \ncontractor. He disputes the findings of the investigation conducted by the contractor and \nthe basis of the termination. He was accused of making threats of bodily harm to co-\nworkers and a general threat using the term \u201cactive shooter.\u201d  \n \n \nWhile working for the primary contactor Applicant held a second job as a security \nofficer, which required that he carry a firearm. His coworkers were aware of his second \njob and were aware he was authorized to have a firearm. Applicant admitted that he slept \nat his main job. He said he was not tired, but took a nap at his desk because he had an \nhour for lunch, and did not know what else to do.2 \n \n \nWitness X testified on behalf the Government. She stated that she and Applicant \nwere friends both professionally and personally. She was not his supervisor, but was \nresponsible for advising the program manager about issues in the office. She and \nApplicant interacted throughout the day. Employee Y provided a statement and in it said \nthat she interacted with Applicant throughout the day.3  \n \n \nWitness X had observed Applicant sleeping during work over the course of a \ncouple of months and that he kept a pillow in his desk drawer. She had reported his \nconduct to Mr. B, the program manager, because it impacted her job. Mr. W is the project \nmanager and to whom Applicant reports. On October 21, 2015, the day before the alleged \n                                                          \n1 Tr. 91-97, 120; GE 1. \n \n2 Tr. 97-99. \n \n3 Tr. 21-23. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nincident, Mr W, in a memo to Mr. B, noted that he had observed Applicant sleeping at his \ndesk.4 He stated:  \n \nI stopped by [office] yesterday to chat with [Employee Y] for a bit. I found \n[Applicant] sleeping at his desk, [Witness X] was quick to point out that \n[Applicant] was on his lunch break. (I will take her at her word that was the \ncase). Regardless, the workplace is not the venue to catch up on your sleep. \n[Applicant] can find a shady spot down the road somewhere to catch a nap \non his lunch hour. I will let you address this while it is a housekeeping item \nthat doesn\u2019t go outside of our group.5 \n \n \nWitness X testified that on October 21, 2015, the morning of the alleged incident, \nApplicant appeared to be acting normal. Later that day she noticed a change in his \nbehavior, and he was angry because he had been counseled for sleeping at work. He \nwas specifically angry at Mr. B and indicated that Mr. B would have an active shooter on \nhis hands. Witness X considered this statement a credible threat because Applicant was \nalready angry with Mr. B based on Applicant\u2019s complaint that Mr. B was interfering in the \nwarehouse operations. Witness X stated that Applicant had previously expressed his \ndissatisfaction with Mr. B by screaming at her, using profanity and dropping things in the \nwarehouse.6 \n \nWitness X credibly testified that when Applicant mentioned \u201cactive shooter\u201d she \nbecame scared. She did not know if Applicant was capable of that behavior, but was \naware he had a firearm, which she believed he kept it in his car. Applicant had previously \ntalked to her about having a gun. She thought that Applicant was always tired because \nhe was working two jobs. Witness X\u2019s testimony is corroborated by a written statement \nshe made the day after the incident.7 \n \nEmployee Y was present when that \u201cactive shooter\u201d comment was made. She \nmade a written statement the day after the incident.8 She stated:  \n \nAfter noticing his anger and aggressive behavior, I asked [Applicant] what \nwas wrong. He said that [Mr. W-his supervisor] told [Applicant] that he \nwanted to talk to him today and instructed him not leave the building until \nthey spoke. [Applicant] said [Mr. B] told [Mr. W] that [Mr. B] caught \n[Applicant] sleeping and that he sleeps all the time. [Applicant] tried to \nexplain that he only slept for 15 minutes. However, [Applicant] said that if \n[Mr. B] kept it up, he would have an active shooter on his hands. After \n                                                          \n4 Tr. 23-25, 32, 43-44; GE 3. \n \n5 GE 3 page 3. \n \n6 Tr. 26-31, 44. \n \n7 Tr. 31, 53; GE 3 page 7. \n \n8 Tr. 31. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nnoticing that [Witness X] and I were not responding, he stormed off to the \nwarehouse and continued emptying out the van with material he picked up \nduring the day. \n \nWhen I went to the warehouse to continue moving desktops to DRMO, \n[Applicant] walked up to me very aggressively and pointed to the office and \nsaid \u2018I just want to smack the piss out of her.\u2019 Without any hesitation, I \nresponded with \u2018Who, [Witness X]?\u2019 After questioning him about why he \nwould say that, he explained to me that [Witness X] runs her mouth to much \nand has no reason to continue telling [Mr. B] what happens in the \nwarehouse. [Applicant] assumed that the reason [Mr. B] came down the \nother day was because [Witness X] mentioned to [Mr. B] that [Applicant] \nhad been sleeping during the day. In actuality, [Mr. B] came to the \nwarehouse to talk to me about MAC reports.  \n \n \nWitness X testified that after Applicant made the statement about \u201cactive shooter\u201d \nshe was scared, and she attempted to contact Mr. B because she wanted to get out of \nthe office. She sent him a text stating Applicant was making inappropriate comments.9  \n \n \nMr. W met with Mr. B on October 21, 2015, to discuss performance issues related \nto Applicant. During the meeting, Mr. B received Witness X\u2019s text stating Applicant was \nmaking inappropriate comments. When Mr. B asked as to what, she replied \u201cActive \nShooter.\u201d Mr. W left the meeting and proceeded to the warehouse. When he arrived at \nthe warehouse, Witness X and Employee Y were in the parking lot leaving the warehouse. \nThey explained to Mr. W that Applicant was angry and making threats. Mr. W inquired \nabout the \u201cactive shooter\u201d statement and was told by both that Applicant was angry and \nmade the threat. Employee Y mentioned the comment that Applicant told her he was \ngoing to \u201cslap the piss out of Witness X.\u201d Mr. W noted that both were visibly upset.10 \n \n \nMr. W met with Applicant and counseled him about sleeping at work and several \nother matters. Mr. W did not initially bring up the \u201cactive shooter\u201d comment and was \nwaiting to see if Applicant would do so on his own.11 He did not. Mr. W stated: \n \nI stated I had heard the term \u201cActive Shooter,\u201d was used by him and asked \nif he had said it or not. He said \u201cyes\u201d he had said active shooter, it was not \ndirected at anyone in specific only that he was angry over the issues that \noccurred that day and he was not actually threatening anyone. I explained \nthe statement was completely inappropriate and even stating it without any \nthreat intended was not acceptable behavior. I told him I had seen both \n[Witness X] and [Employee Y] as I arrived and they appeared visibly shaken \nand upset. I stated perhaps an apology was appropriate. I required no \n                                                          \n9 Tr. 31, 48; GE 3. \n \n10 Tr. 33, 39-40, 48-51, 56. \n \n11 Tr. 56; GE 3. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nfurther information and when [Applicant] asked, I did not state whether he \nwould be terminated or not. I simply stated it was a possibility. With his \nresponse, the counseling session was over and I proceed to the OCIO \nConference room to meet with [Mr. B].12  \n \n \nMr. W met with Mr. B, Witness X, and Employee Y immediately after the counseling \nsession with Applicant.13 In Mr. W\u2019s incident report he stated:  \n \nI relayed my first impression and listened to [Witness X] and [Employee Y\u2019s] \nperception of the threat. Both relayed their perception was that it was real, \nor could be real. [Mr. B] indicated [Applicant] was to be removed from the \nproject.14 \n \n \nWitness X said she received seven phone calls and text messages within a ten-\nminute time span while she was still in the conference room with Mr. B, Mr. W, and \nEmployee Y from Applicant asking that she call him. She did not respond. About twenty \nminutes later she received a text message from Applicant saying \u201cThanks I\u2019m fired.\u201d15 He \nalso attempted to contact her by phone in 2016, but instead talked to Witness X\u2019s \nhusband. She has blocked his number. She testified she was very scared and hesitant to \nbe in the same building with him. She said she agreed to testify because she decided if \nshe did not then she was not doing her part. She is afraid he will gain access to the place \nwhere she works, and she is afraid to see him. When cross-examined, she confirmed that \nthere was no one in the warehouse for him to direct his active shooter comment to. She \nconfirmed that Applicant was referring to Mr. B when he said he would have an active \nshooter on his hands. She testified that she felt like Applicant was going to get his gun \nand his comments were directed toward both Mr. B and those in the office. Applicant was \nstanding next to Witness X when he made the comments.16 \n \n \nApplicant testified that he maintains a weapon as part of his second job, but it kept \non the premises at that location. Applicant testified that he had a discussion with Mr. B \nand was told Mr. W would be talking with him. He admitted to sleeping during his \nlunchbreak, but denied other performance issues. He left his meeting with Mr. B and went \nto the warehouse.17  \n \n \nApplicant testified he was speaking to a Marine in the warehouse and they were \ndiscussing active shooter training. He believed Employee Y heard the conversation. He \n                                                          \n12 GE 3 pages 1-2. \n \n13 GE 3. \n \n14 GE 3 pages 1-2. \n \n15 Tr. 51-52; GE 3 page 7. \n \n16 Tr. 34-37, 45-47; GE 3. \n \n17 Tr. 65-69. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nsurmised that Employee Y told Witness X about the conversation. He said Employee Y \nthen returned and asked him what was going on. He stated that he told her that he \nbelieved Witness X told Mr. B about him sleeping at his desk. Her response was that \nApplicant always sleeps at his desk. Employee Y then left with Witness X. Applicant \ntestified that Witness X was not present when he was talking to the Marine, and she would \nnot have been able to hear his conversation.18  \n \n \nApplicant testified that the Marine, with whom he was having the discussion about \nactive shooter training, was returning equipment to the warehouse. The Marine was \nrequired to log the equipment in and out and sign his name to a log. Applicant did not \nprovide the name of the Marine to corroborate his statement.19 \n \n \nApplicant was then contacted by Mr. W. When Mr. W told him to apologize to \nWitness X and Employee Y, Applicant did not know the reason for that request. He \ntestified he was not angry or agitated. His demeanor is always \u201chappy go lucky.\u201d20 He \nwas a little upset with Mr. B. He concurred that Witness X was in a different room and \nwould not have been able to hear the conversation with the Marine.21  \n \n \nApplicant testified that he did not mention \u201cactive shooter\u201d to Witness X and \nEmployee Y. He does not know why Witness X would be frightened as they had been \nfriends and attended family social gatherings. He denied he said he wanted to slap \nWitness X. He believe both Witness X and Employee Y misunderstood the active shooter \nissue. He said he did not threaten anyone.22  \n \n \nThere is no mention of the Marine in the incident report or in the email Mr. W sent \nto Mr. B days later. Applicant does not know why Mr. W did not include it.23  \n \n \nApplicant testified that Witness X is lying. He has no idea why. He believes \nEmployee Y overheard his conversation with the Marine, went and told Witness X. He \ntestified that Employee Y was lying in her statement because she wanted his job. She \nwas also lying when she said that Applicant stated he wanted to slap Witness X. When \nasked if Employee Y was intentionally sabotaging him so he would not get her position, \nhe testified, \u201cyes.\u201d24 Witness X was lying because \u201cI think when she came back there and \n                                                          \n18 Tr. 69-74. \n \n19 Tr. 101-102. \n \n20 Tr. 76.  \n \n21 Tr. 69-72.  \n \n22 Tr. 69. \n \n23 Tr. 110-119. \n \n24 Tr. 110 \n\n \n7 \n \n \nmentioned active shooter, I think it agitated her due to the fact that maybe she was \nemotional. I don\u2019t know.\u201d25 \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he stated his conversation with the Marine must \nhave been overheard, misunderstood, and taken out of context by coworkers. He stated, \n\u201cI was terminated without a chance to explain what had occurred.\u201d26 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s pastor testified on his behalf. He has known Applicant for ten years and \nbelieves he is honest. Applicant is part of a ministerial team that teaches bible study and \nspiritual awareness. The witness was unaware of the nature of Applicant\u2019s discharge from \nthe service. Another witness testified that he has known Applicant for three years. He is \nhis supervisor at his second job. Applicant has received numerous accolades from senior \nofficials at this job. His demeanor is outstanding.27  \n \n \nApplicant provided copies of achievement awards and certificates of training. He \nprovided character letters stating he is approachable, professional, dependable, loyal, \nresponsible, helpful, respectful, dedicated, courteous, generous, organized, prepared, \nand self-motivated.28  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \n                                                          \n25 Tr. 73, 107, 110-119. \n \n26 Answer to SOR.  \n \n27 Tr. 123-140. \n \n28 Answer to SOR.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable:  \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \n\n \n9 \n \n \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, considerations of: \u2026 (2) any disruptive, \nviolent, or other inappropriate behavior. \n \nApplicant was terminated from his position as a contractor in 2015 for aggressive \nbehavior. He reportedly made threats of bodily harm and general threats using the term \n\u201cactive shooter.\u201d There is credible evidence that he threatened to slap a coworker. He \nwas angry because he was being counseled for sleeping at work and mentioned \u201cactive \nshooter.\u201d The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying condition. \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom personal conduct. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n17: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability.  \n \nBoth Witness X and Employee Y made written statements at or about the time the \nincident occurred. Mr. W\u2019s summary of the events that transpired are consistent with both \nWitness X and Employee Y. Witness X credibly testified and was cross-examined. I did \nnot find Applicant\u2019s testimony credible. The evidence was reliable and sufficiently \nsubstantiated the allegation. I find AG \u00b6 17(f) does not apply. \n \nApplicant admitted to Mr. W that he said the words \u201cactive shooter.\u201d There is no \nmention in Mr. W\u2019s summary or his email to Mr. B that Applicant told him that he was \ntalking to a Marine when he said it. To the contrary, he admitted to Mr. W that he said the \nterm, but did not intend to make a threat. In today\u2019s environment, and in the wake of \nshootings on military bases, school shootings, and shootings at nightclubs, there are \nserious concerns when certain words are said, even in jest, which could be cause for \nalarm. The public is told to report anything suspicious and to be vigilant. Witness X was \nscared, and she and Employee Y were upset when they noticed Applicant was angry and \nused the words. His statement that he wanted to slap Witness X was threatening and \ninappropriate. Applicant\u2019s conduct is not minor and it casts doubt on his reliability and \ntrustworthiness. It raises serious concerns about his judgment. I find AG \u00b6 17(c) does not \napply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n10 \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 45 years old. He did not meet his burden of persuasion. His termination \nfrom his contractor\u2019s job because of aggressive behavior and threating words is serious. \nThe record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline E, personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

(Answer; Tr. 39-40.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.k:  account for a purchase of furniture placed in collection for $1,257. \nApplicant testified that he made a $1,000 down payment to the original creditor and \nmonthly payments of about $100 totaling about $1,200. He was never given credit for the \ndown payment or the monthly payments. Applicant denied this allegation, because he is \nin an adversarial process with the original creditor. SOR \u00b6 1.s is owed to the same \ncollection agency for the same original creditor in an approximately similar amount \n($1,995), although the collection account numbers are different. (GE 4, pp. 13, 19.) \nApplicant believes that those are duplicate accounts. (Tr. 40-44, 63-65.) The weight of \nthe evidence suggests that they are duplicates.  \nSOR \u00b6 1.l: account for an electric utility placed in collection for $235. \nApplicant resolved this account in November 2017. (AE B; Tr. 44-46.) \n SOR \u00b6 1.m: account for a broken lease placed for collection for $3,373. At \nthe time, Applicant was having problems with his then wife, and he moved out and made \nno further payments on the lease. Although he disputed this debt and had it removed from \nhis credit report, Applicant agrees that he still owes that debt and intends to pay it after \ntaking care of some of the larger debts. He has not, however, set up a payment plan. (Tr. \n46-49.)\n\n4 \nSOR \u00b6 1.n: medical account placed for collection for $188. Applicant testified \nthat this debt was for medical treatment for his son. Applicant paid this debt and had it \nremoved from his credit report. This debt does not appear on the most recent credit \nreports. (Tr. 49-51; GE 2; GE 3.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.o: cell phone account placed for collection for $2,019. Applicant \ntestified that this was an account he had in about 2009, and he disputed the amount \nowed. He does intend to pay this account but has not set up a payment plan. (Tr. 51-56.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.p: cell phone account placed for collection for $769. Applicant \ntestified that he closed the account, because he was dissatisfied with the service. He \nplanned to pay this off in December 2016 but was unable to do so due to lack of money. \nApplicant plans to contact the creditor in October 2018. (Tr. 56-59.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.q: gym membership account placed for collection for $449. Applicant \ntestified that he became a member of the gym in 2013 or 2014 but was unable to use it, \nbecause his disability made exercising too painful. He planned to pay this debt and \ncontact the gym in December 2018. (Tr. 59-62.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.r: cell phone account placed for collection for $1,982. Applicant \ntestified that this is an account he set up for his sister in about 2009 but is in his name. \nHe has not made any payments but intends to address that bill in 2019. (Tr. 62-63.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.s: See discussion of SOR \u00b6 1.k, supra. \nSOR \u00b6 1.t: gym membership account placed for collection for $500. Applicant \ntestified that he joined this gym in 2014. He was going to use the membership, but it \nclosed and left no phone numbers or where it had moved. Applicant called a national \nnumber and was told they did not have his account. So, he stopped making payments. \nHe intends to pay the collection agency. (Tr. 65-67.) \nApplicant testified that he incurred the SOR debts between October 2006 (when \nhe became disabled due to service-connected injuries) and August 2015 (when he found \nfull-time employment). (Tr. 21-23, 27-37, 40-56, 59-63, 65-67; AE A; GE 2-GE 4.) \nTo sum up, Applicant has resolved the following debts: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.d, 1.j and \n1.n = $10,306. The following debts have been deleted as being duplicative: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h-\n1.i and 1.s = $15,921. Corrected for duplicate accounts, the SOR alleged $28,026 of\ndelinquent debts of which $10,306 have been resolved, leaving $17,720 of unresolved\nSOR debt. Applicant has disputed SOR \u00b6 1.k ($1,257) with the original creditor, because\nhe claims it failed to give him credit for his down payment ($1,000) and for monthly\npayments totaling $1,200. If that dispute is credited to Applicant, $16,463 remains of\nunresolved SOR debt.\nApplicant testified about the current state of his finances. His gross monthly pay \nbefore deductions is about $6,000. After payroll deductions, which includes child support \n\n5 \n \nand medical insurance for his two minor children, Applicant\u2019s take-home pay is about \n$3,900 per month. After deductions for his mortgage, car, utilities, cable, his monthly IT \ncontinuing education courses and adding in $350 per month of VA benefits, Applicant has \na monthly remainder of between $1,500 and $1,800. He uses that remainder to continue \nto pay off his delinquent debts. Applicant tried a credit counseling service but was not \nsatisfied with it. His budget is his checkbook. Applicant has a 401(k) plan to which he \ncontributes 3% per paycheck but does not know its balance. In November 2017, he got \nthree credit cards, one with a $500 line, and two with $400 lines. Applicant is current with \nthose credit card payments, and they are not maxed out. (Tr. 68-76, 78-80, 84-85.) \n \n \nApplicant has no student loan payments, because they are deferred while he \npursues his Master\u2019s degree. He purchased his house in November 2017. At present, \nApplicant is temporarily renting, because his house has mold infestation to which he is \nallergic.  (Tr. 74, 81-82.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe Under Secretary of Defense\u2019s Memorandum of November 19, 2004, treats \nADP positions as sensitive positions, and it entitles applicants for ADP positions to the \nprocedural protections in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination \nmay be made. The standard set out in the Manual and the adjudicative guidelines for \nassignment to sensitive duties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness \nare such that assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security. AG \u00b6 2.b.   \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, \nby necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial \nand commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d The Government must present \nsubstantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.14. Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \n\n6 \n \n \nAn applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of \ndisproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. \nBd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly \nconsistent with national security to grant or continue eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .   \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nestablish the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n\n7 \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous and \npersist to this day.   \nAG \u00b6 20(b) has two tests. First, the conditions that resulted in Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems must be largely beyond his control. Here, Applicant suffered from a service-\nconnected disability in October 2006. As a result of that disability, he was unemployed \nuntil August 2015. The resulting extraordinarily long period of disability-induced \nunemployment severely impacted Applicant\u2019s finances. Those were conditions largely \nbeyond his control. The first test under AG \u00b6 20(b) is satisfied. \nThe second test under AG \u00b6 20(b) is whether Applicant acted responsibly under \nthose adverse circumstances. After becoming disabled in 2006 and while receiving SS \ndisability benefits beginning in 2008, Applicant went on to earn an Associate\u2019s degree (in \n2008) and his Bachelor\u2019s degree (in 2014). He then commenced work on his Master\u2019s \ndegree. There is no doubt that Applicant\u2019s dedication to furthering his education after \nbeing declared disabled allowed him to earn full-time employment as a software \ndeveloper in August 2015. This in turn allowed Applicant to begin to address the financial  \ndelinquencies (discussed below) that his disability and unemployment caused. Applicant \nacted responsibly. Therefore, the second test under AG \u00b6 20(b) is satisfied, and AG \u00b6 \n20(b) fully applies.  \nBy the time of the hearing, Applicant had resolved SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.d, 1.j, and 1.n, \ntotaling $10,306. Therefore, Applicant submitted evidence of good-faith efforts to pay or \nsettle his delinquent debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) is established. Applicant\u2019s conduct after he was \ndeclared disabled in 2008 shows a track record of responsible conduct, first in improving \nhis chance of getting full-time employment and then once he did, by beginning to address \nhis delinquent debts. Applicant\u2019s monthly remainder (between $1,500 and $1,800) is \nsufficient to allow him to defray the remaining SOR debts by setting up payment plans. I \nam confident that Applicant will continue on that track.  \nApplicant\u2019s testimony about his dispute with the original creditor of SOR \u00b6 1.k \n($1,257) was credible and presented a reasonable basis for the dispute. \nAbsent supporting documentation, AG \u00b6 20(e) is only partially established for that \nallegation. \n\n8 \n \n \n The record does not create doubt about Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, good \njudgment, and ability to protect sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I \nweighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed \nthe unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person \nconcept. (AG \u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).) \n  \n Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion to \nshow that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant him eligibility \nfor access to sensitive information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.h-1.i: \n \n \n \nWithdrawn \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.j-1.t: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of the record as a whole, I conclude that it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position. \nEligibility is granted. \n \n \n \n \nPhilip J.

Cervi, Administrative Judge \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on September 12, \n2016. On November 27, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) sent him a statement of reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns \nunder Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nand DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). The Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \nwere revised effective June 8, 2017, and apply herein. Applicant answered the SOR on \nJanuary 25, 2018, and requested a hearing. \n \nThe case was assigned to me on October 3, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on February 28, 2019, scheduling the \n\n \n2 \n \nhearing for April 8, 2019. The hearing was convened via video teleconference, as \nscheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified. The record was held open to permit Applicant to submit \ndocumentary evidence in mitigation. Applicant Exhibit (AE) A was submitted, which \ninclude tax notices and portions of tax returns. AE A was admitted in evidence without \nobjection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 18, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old trainer, employed by a defense contractor since 2012. \nHe graduated from high school in 1979. He was previously married in 1985 and divorced \nin 2013. He has four adult children, but continues to pay child support for one special \nneeds child. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from 1979 to 1982, and in the \nArmy Reserve since 1982. Applicant has held a security clearance for 40 years since first \nentering the Army. In 2007, The Department of the Army warned Applicant about \ndelinquent debts when his clearance was renewed. \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant is delinquent on five debts totaling over $97,000, and \nhe failed to file and pay Federal income taxes for tax year 2016; owes the IRS for income \ntaxes due for tax years 2014 to 2016; and has two state tax liens from 2013 and 2015. \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations, but explained that his 2016 tax return was filed \nwhen due, but the taxes were not paid. \n \nApplicant attributes his poor financial status largely to his 2013 divorce. He noted \nthat his spouse handled household financial matters including taxes. They purchased a \nhome in 1998, and Applicant left the home in 2012 after his spouse left. They agreed to \nlist the home for three to six months, but were unable to sell it. Applicant stopped \npayments when he left for a job in another state. A foreclosure action was started in 2017, \nand Applicant is past due about $85,000. He has done nothing to determine the status of \nthe debt or to attempt to resolve it. (SOR 1.a) Applicant noted that after the divorce, he \nhad difficulty transitioning to single living and paying bills on his own.  \n \nApplicant is past due on a loan that he claimed was taken out with his ex-spouse \nfor about $1,000. His credit report shows the loan was in his name individually. In \nresponse to Government interrogatories, Applicant was unaware of the debt. In testimony, \nhe claimed that he has a payment agreement with the creditor and paid the loan off, but \nhe did not provide evidence of the agreement or evidence that the loan has been paid, \ndespite discussing it at the hearing. (SOR 1.b) This debt remains unresolved. \n \nApplicant provided evidence that his 2016 Federal tax return was filed when due, \nbut he failed to pay the income tax owed. (SOR 1.c) Applicant admitted that he owed \nFederal taxes for 2014 to 2016, that he did not have the money to pay his taxes on time, \nand that he was slow about contacting the IRS to make payment arrangements. (SOR \n1.d) However, the documentation he provided from the IRS shows he was behind on \nincome tax payments for tax years 2012 to 2016, causing him to owe interest, penalties \nor other charges, totaling $23,340. His pay was garnished and in 2016, he contacted the \n\n \n3 \n \nIRS and made an arrangement to repay past-due income taxes. He borrowed money from \nhis 401k retirement program and made three sizable lump-sum payments in January and \nFebruary 2017, then paid monthly to June 2017. By July 2017, he reduced his tax liability \nto $7,424, and apparently continued to pay. In March 2019, the IRS applied Applicant\u2019s \n2018 refund ($532) to the remainder of his 2016 tax liability, and paid off the balance. \nApplicant\u2019s tax preparer assisted him in adjusting his income withholding to cover his \nfuture tax liabilities. This debt is resolved. \n \nApplicant owes state taxes resulting in liens filed in 2013 and 2015, totaling $4,369. \nHe has not shown sufficient efforts to resolve these debts and they remain unpaid. (SOR \n1.e and 1.f)  \n \nApplicant has not sought financial counseling and earns about $92,000 annually. \nHe has about $700 net savings per month after paying expenses, and has about $2,000 \nin a savings account. In 2018, he paid a state income tax liability from 2015 owed to \nanother state, and intends to continue to pay other debts as appropriate according to his \nfinancial ability. \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\n \n4 \n \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG 19 include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence are sufficient to establish \nthe disqualifying conditions above. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG 20 are potentially relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial status was likely negatively impacted by his divorce, however, \nhe admitted to difficulty transitioning to life on his own, and did not adequately take \nresponsibility for his own financial obligations. He filed his income tax returns when due, \nbut did not pay taxes owed. He completed a payment plan with the IRS to resolve his \nFederal tax obligations, but has not resolved his delinquent state tax obligations. There \nis insufficient evidence that he has attempted to resolve the remaining SOR debts.  \n \nThe Appeal Board has long held: \n \nSecurity requirements include consideration of a person\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and a sense of his or her legal obligations. Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union, Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). Failure to comply with Federal tax laws suggests \n\n \n6 \n \nthat an applicant has a problem with abiding by well-established \ngovernment rules and regulations. Voluntary compliance with rules and \nregulations is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). \n \nApplicant\u2019s lack of financial responsibility with regard to tax obligations and other \ndebts show a history of financial difficulties that have not been overcome to date. There \nis no evidence that Applicant has sought financial counseling or assistance with his debts \nexcept for tax preparation services. He has not shown efforts to contact creditors and \nstate tax authorities to resolve debt, despite significant time since the Government first \nshowed its concern with his delinquent debts. Overall, based on the record presented, I \nam unable to conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are under control or are unlikely \nto recur. No conditions fully apply to mitigate his delinquent state tax obligations and other \ndebts. Applicant is credited with filing his Federal income taxes when due, and he \nsatisfactorily resolved his Federal tax obligations through a payment plan. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG 2(d). Although adverse information concerning a single criterion may \nnot be sufficient for an unfavorable eligibility determination, the individual may be found \nineligible if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable \njudgment, irresponsibility, or unstable behavior. AG 2(e). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of \nfact and comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant\u2019s personal \ndifficulties do not overcome his history of financial irresponsibility, especially with respect \nto tax obligations, despite his long history of security clearance eligibility and military \nservice. \n \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c and 1.d: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.e and 1.f: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Cervi, Administrative Judge \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on June 29, 2016. On \nJanuary 12, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a statement of reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nF.1\nThe case was assigned to me on April 25, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on June 12, 2018, scheduling the hearing \n1 The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). The Adjudicative Guidelines were \n(AG) were revised effective on June 8, 2017, and apply herein. \n01/10/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nfor July 11, 2018. The hearing was convened as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 5 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified and Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AE) A and B were admitted without objection. The record was held open for \nApplicant to submit additional information. He submitted AE C, consisting of a statement, \nstate tax returns, and budget documentation, which were admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on July 24, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old munitions inspector and logistics technician, employed \nby a defense contractor since 2016. He was unemployed from 2006 to 2007, and from \nJanuary 2010 to January 2011. He graduated from high school in 1979 and attended \nsome college. He married in 2011 and separated in 2012. He has three adult children. He \nserved on active duty in the U.S. Army from 1979 to 1999, and retired. He has not held a \nsecurity clearance since retiring from the Army.  \n \nThe SOR alleges 17 allegations under Guideline F, including failure to file Federal \ntax returns from 2012 to 2015; Federal tax debts for tax years 2012, 2015, and 2016; and \nother delinquent debts totaling approximately $21,000. Applicant admitted all of the \nallegations, except he denied two medical debts and a telephone collection account. \nDuring the hearing, Applicant also admitted to failing to file state tax returns from 2012 to \n2015 that were not alleged in the SOR. Applicant\u2019s credit reports show the SOR debts \nwere incurred between 2012 and 2016. \n \nApplicant explained that he did not file tax returns as required, because he believed \nhe did not earn enough to require him to file and did not believe he owed any taxes. In \nresponse to Government inquiries, he filed all Federal tax returns by July 2017. After \nreceiving refunds for some years, he owed about $3,500. In October 2017, he arranged \nan IRS payment schedule beginning February 2018. He pays $98 per month that is \nautomatically deducted from his bank account, and will continue for 35 months. He has \nmade consistent payments as required, and his balance as of July 2018 was $1,842. He \nalso filed all delinquent state tax returns, and received a net refund. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is a $7,595 debt for a loan on a vehicle transferred to another person \nwho did not make payments as required. Applicant contacted the lender and negotiated \na settlement that was paid in full in February 2017. This debt is resolved and does not \nappear on his most recent credit report. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f is a charged-off credit-card debt in the amount of $2,818. Applicant \ncontacted the creditor in October 2017 and was offered a lump-sum settlement, however \nhe was unable to pay the full amount. He intends to make monthly payments to resolve \nthe debt once his other debts have been resolved and he has the available funds. As of \nnow, this debt remains unresolved and is the only debt remaining on his most recent \ncredit report. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g is a collection agency account for a phone carrier that Applicant \ndisputed. He contacted the agency in November 2017 and was told that no account \nexisted. This allegation is resolved and it does not appear on his most recent credit report. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i are collection accounts from cable television providers. \nApplicant spoke with one agency in March 2018 and agreed to make a payment on July \n15, 2018, however he disputed the debt. When he called again to make the payment, he \nwas told there was no record of the account. (SOR \u00b6 1.h)  Applicant attempted to contact \nthe collection agency holding the other debt, but received no answer on the phone after \nrepeated attempts in November 2017, and in January and February 2018. He believes \nthe company is now out of business. (SOR \u00b6 1.i)  These debts are disputed and resolved. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j and 1.m are medical debts that Applicant denied and disputed with the \ncredit reporting agencies. He only uses military treatment facilities and veterans hospitals \nfor medical care and did not incur any additional charges. There is insufficient evidence \nshowing the origin of these debts, and one is disputed on Applicant\u2019s most recent credit \nreport, while the other has been removed. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k is a $290 debt related to a defective apartment cooling unit that was \nalleged in a lawsuit. The debt was paid and the complaint was dismissed in 2017. The \ndebt is resolved and does not appear on his most current credit reports. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l is a small collection account for a utility provider. Applicant paid the debt \nin full in January 2018. It is resolved and does not appear on his most current credit \nreports. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.n is a collection account for a utility provider. Applicant contacted the \nagency and was told there is no record of the account. He was advised to contact the \ncredit bureaus to have the account removed. This debt is resolved and does not appear \non his most recent credit reports. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.o is an older collection account that is no longer active. Applicant also \ncontacted the original creditor, a phone service provider, but they have no record of the \naccount, and it does not appear on his most current credit reports. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p and 1.q are merged accounts with one collection agency. The \ncollection agency did not accept payment over the phone, so Applicant drove to another \ncity to pay the debts in person. They were paid in full in February 2018 and are resolved \nand do not appear on his most current credit reports. \n \nApplicant has spent the past three years resolving his delinquent debts, and pays \nall new obligations when due. He earns about $39,000 per year, and has a military \nretirement and VA disability income of about $20,000 per year. He attended financial \ncounseling classes and submitted a comprehensive budget as a result. All tax returns \nhave been filed and he is current on his tax payment plan. At the hearing, Applicant was \ncredible and contrite, and he showed a renewed understanding of his financial obligations \n\n \n4 \n \nand understands the importance of paying debts when due, and filing tax returns when \nrequired. As a result of his financial counseling, he now ensures he lives within his means \nand controls his spending. \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993). \n \n\n \n5 \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02- \n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the record supporting the \nSOR allegations are sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions above. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n\n \n6 \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant\u2019s tax delinquencies and other debts have been a recurring problem that \nbegan to be addressed in 2016 when Applicant started his current employment. Through \nperiods of unemployment and separation from his spouse, he fell behind on debts. He \nalso failed to file tax returns when due, under the mistaken belief that he did not earn \nenough money to require filing tax returns or that he did not owe any taxes. He was wrong. \nUpon notice of the incomplete filings, he filed all returns and made arrangements to repay \nany taxes owed. He received a net refund for state taxes. Applicant diligently contacted \ncreditors and collection agencies to resolve his delinquent debts, and made substantial \nefforts toward their resolution. He has since attended financial counseling and has a \ncomprehensive budget. He showed a renewed understanding of his financial obligations, \nincluding tax-filing requirements. \n \nOverall, I find that Applicant has substantially addressed his financial and tax \nobligations, and has shown several years of financial responsibility. He has adequately \naddressed the SOR allegations and resolved most of the accounts. I find that his financial \nstatus is under control based on his diligence in addressing his debts, recent financial \neducation, and his testimony at the hearing. I do not believe that similar problems are \nlikely to recur. Mitigating conditions AG \u00b6 20 (a) \u2013 (e), and (g) apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \n\n \n7 \n \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d).2 Although adverse information concerning a single criterion \nmay not be sufficient for an unfavorable eligibility determination, the individual may be \nfound ineligible if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of \nquestionable judgment, irresponsibility, or unstable behavior. AG \u00b6 2(e). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of \nfact and comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant\u2019s Federal \nand state tax delinquencies no longer remain a concern. His other debts have been \nsubstantially resolved through diligent efforts within his means. He has a renewed \nunderstanding of how to plan for financial responsibilities and has shown that he pays his \ncurrent financial obligations when due. \n \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant him eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.q:   \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

The hearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered four exhibits \n(Exs.), noted as Exs. 1-4, and Applicant presented six exhibits, marked as Exs. A-F. \nWith no objections, all exhibits were accepted into the record. Applicant was granted \nthrough October 10, 2018, to submit any additional materials. On October 10, 2018, a \nfile of material was offered by Applicant and admitted without objection as Ex. G. The \n1 The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) effective within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017. \n03/28/2019\n\n \n \n \n \n2 \nrecord was then closed. In the interim, the transcript (Tr.) was received on October 4, \n2018. Based on the testimony, materials, and record as a whole, I find Applicant failed \nto mitigate financial considerations security concerns. \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old project manager who has been with his current \nemployer for over four years. In 2013, he earned an associate\u2019s degree in business and \nadministration. The father of four children, he is currently going through a divorce. \nApplicant has never received financial counseling. Over time, when the stress of being \nthe sole provider in his home would impact him financially, he did not know how to try to \nwork with his lenders. (Tr. 44-45) At issue in the SOR are 10 delinquent debts \namounting to about $10,000.  \n \nIn 2013, Applicant graduated from college. He was scheduled to begin payments \non his student loans (SOR allegations 1.a-1.d and 1.f-1.g) in 2014, but he did not have \nthe financial means to do so. (Tr. 36-37) He wanted to go back to school, which would \nhave deferred his existing student loans, but by then the loans were in default. He did \nnot apply for forbearance or deferral because he was not aware of such programs. He \ndid not contact his lenders to let them know he could not afford to pay. (Tr. 38)  \n \nBy early 2016, Applicant began receiving bills from a collection agency for the \nlender. (Tr. 38) At that point, he decided to make inquiries concerning the debts. \nApplicant recalls making about four such payments on the loans in or by December \n2017. At hearing, the parties agreed that there were at least two payments for $50 each. \n(Tr. 39) Evidence was also presented indicating two additional payments were made in \n2017, for $15 and $30, respectively. (Ex. G) \n \n \nIn March 2018, a primary lender contacted Applicant to inform him it now held his \ndefaulted student loans. It gave him the opportunity to resume making payments, or to \nprovide some information by which he and the lender could arrive at a mutually \nagreeable installment plan to make him eligible for loan rehabilitation or pay-off \nconsolidation. (Tr. 39) It was suggested Applicant could make monthly payments of \n$600, but Applicant was unable to pay that sum. A few months later, the loans again \nwent into collection. At present, Applicant is waiting for paperwork to initiate the process \nof consolidation.  \n \n \nAlso at issue are four other delinquent accounts (SOR allegations 1.e, 1.h, 1.i, \n1.j) The parties agreed at the hearing that the debt at 1.j ($290) was shown paid. (Tr. \n44) In his post-hearing package, Applicant provided evidence of the following: The $438 \ndebt at 1.i was made subject to a settlement agreement and the final payment of $131 \npaid in October 2018. The $655 debt at 1.h was settled in full on or about October 1, \n2018. Applicant testified that the $5,592 debt at 1.e was made subject to a $100-a- \nmonth repayment plan. A copy of that plan was not submitted, but documentary \nevidence of a $100 payment from September 2018 was offered. (Ex. D)  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n3 \n \nToday, Applicant is living within his means. (Tr. 47) He only has one credit card \nwith a small credit limit he rarely uses. At the end of the month, after all regular bills are \npaid, he has a remainder of between $500-$800 from a net monthly income of \napproximately $5,000. He does not expect to suffer financially from his pending divorce. \nHe has a retirement and a savings account. Once divorced, he will live with his parents.  \n  \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. Decisions necessarily include consideration \nof the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard such \ninformation. Decisions shall be in terms of the national interest and do not question the \nloyalty of an applicant.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nUnder Guideline F, AG \u00b6 18 sets forth that the security concern under this \nguideline is that failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \n\n \n \n \n \n4 \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.  \n \nHere, the Government offered documentary evidence reflecting that Applicant \nhas numerous delinquent debts. This is sufficient to invoke financial considerations \ndisqualifying conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the inability to do so; and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nFour conditions could mitigate the finance-related security concerns posed here:  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nThere are multiple delinquent debts at issue, some dating back to after \nApplicant\u2019s 2013 college graduation. Applicant cites to no event out of his control that \nled him to acquire these delinquent debts; he only points to periods of time when being \nthe sole-earner in his family was insufficient to meet all expenses. Applicant has not \nreceived financial counseling. He is, however, presently living within his means.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s credible testimony reflects that he has begun approaching the \nsituation with his student loans in earnest. His protraction in addressing the matter, \nhowever, left him rushing to gather documentary evidence regarding plans to address \nthe loans before, during, and after the hearing. At present, Applicant is waiting for \npaperwork to initiate the process of student loan consolidation. Otherwise, there is only \ndocumentary evidence of a couple of payments toward the loans made long ago.  \n\n \n \n \n \n5 \nThe parties agreed at the hearing that the debt at 1.j ($290) was previously paid. \nThe debt at 1.i ($438) was settled and paid in October 2018. The debt at 1.h ($655) was \nsettled in full on or about October 1, 2018. Applicant failed to offer documentary \nevidence, however, reflecting that the $5,592 debt at 1.e was, in fact, put formally into a \nrepayment plan under which he had developed a meaningful track record for \nrepayment. At best, AG \u00b6 20(d) applies. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Here, I have considered those factors. I \nam also mindful that, under AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based on \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old project manager who has worked for his current \nemployer for over four years. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in business and \nadministration in 2013. Married, but currently undergoing a divorce, he is the father of \nfour children. Applicant acquired delinquent debt due to insufficient income, not through \ncircumstances beyond his control. When faced with financial difficulties, he would not \nknow where to turn or how to proceed. Applicant has never received financial \ncounseling. At issue in the SOR are 10 delinquent debts amounting to about $10,000. \n \nToday, Applicant is living within his means, but his delinquent debts remain \nlargely unaddressed. Only about $1,400 of the total debt at issue has been satisfied, \nwith two of those debts having been satisfied in October 2018, after the SOR issuance. \nHe has apparently expended effort on resolving his student loan issues, but he delayed \naddressing those debts and the procedure to do so has been more protracted and \nonerous than expected, with scant evidence of how he should proceed available. Until \nmore information and paperwork is received, Applicant remains in limbo. Meanwhile, the \ndebt at 1.e for a sum in excess of $5,000 lacks sufficient documentary evidence as to its \nstatus. \n \nThis process does not require an applicant to satisfy all his delinquent debts. It \ndoes, however, demand that one show he has implemented an appropriate scheme for \naddressing that debt, and documentation reflecting a meaningful track record of timely \npayment. Here, insufficient time has passed to provide such documentation. \nConsequently, financial considerations security concerns remain unmitigated.   \n \n   Formal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6 \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n            \nSubparagraphs 1.h-1.j: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n       Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 28-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security clearance for the first time. He is employed as a manufacturing technician for a large company in the defense industry. He has been so employed since March 2016. He earns a wage of about $17 per hour. His educational background includes attending a technical institute from September 2010 to December 2012, when he was awarded an associate\u2019s degree in electronics engineering. He married in 2016, and he and his spouse had a church wedding in July 2018. He has a ten-year-old stepdaughter. His spouse does not receive child support for her daughter. His spouse has a minimum- wage job as a school-bus monitor for children with special needs. Before his current job, Applicant had a full-time job as an assembler from September 2014 to March 2016. Before that, he worked as a contractor from June 2014 to September 2014. Before that, he worked as an installer from March 2013 to June 2014. And before that, he was unemployed and a full-time student as noted above. The SOR concerns a history of financial problems consisting of failure to timely file state income tax returns for tax years 2014 and 2016; failure to timely file federal income tax returns for tax years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2016; $668 in back taxes owed to the IRS for tax year 2015; and a delinquent student loan account charged-off in the amount of $8,426.

De Angelis, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se   \n \n \n07/31/2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \n \nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny his eligibility for \naccess to classified information. Although he is now in compliance with federal and \nstate tax authorities, his tax problems went on for too many years to justify complete \nmitigation. He has also just begun repaying a charged-off student loan account that was \ndelinquent for many years. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non March 8, 2016. (Exhibit 1) This document is commonly known as a security \nclearance application. Thereafter, on December 19, 2017, after reviewing the \napplication and the information gathered during a background investigation, the \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent \nApplicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \n\n \n2 \n \ninformation. The SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the \naction under the security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.   \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 7, 2018. He denied failure to timely file \nfederal income tax returns for 2011 and 2012, because he was then a full-time student \nwithout earned income subject to taxation, but he admitted the remaining SOR \nallegations. He provided a two-page memorandum in explanation, and he included a \nnumber or attachments or enclosures, most of which were subsequently admitted as \nexhibits at the September 2018 hearing. He also requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge.  \n \nThe case was assigned to another judge on May 15, 2018, and then reassigned \nto me on May 22, 2018. The hearing took place as scheduled on September 18, 2018. \nApplicant appeared without counsel. Department Counsel offered documentary exhibits, \nwhich were admitted as Exhibits 1-7. Applicant offered documentary exhibits, which \nwere admitted as Exhibits A-L. Other than Applicant, no witnesses were called. The \nhearing transcript (Tr.) was received on September 25, 2018. \n \nThe record was kept open for approximately 30 days, until October 18, 2018, to \nprovide Applicant an opportunity to present additional documentation concerning his tax \nproblems. Those matters were timely received on October 1, 2018, and they are \nadmitted without objections as Exhibits M-Q.    \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 28-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security \nclearance for the first time. He is employed as a manufacturing technician for a large \ncompany in the defense industry. He has been so employed since March 2016. He \nearns a wage of about $17 per hour. His educational background includes attending a \ntechnical institute from September 2010 to December 2012, when he was awarded an \nassociate\u2019s degree in electronics engineering. He married in 2016, and he and his \nspouse had a church wedding in July 2018. He has a ten-year-old stepdaughter. His \nspouse does not receive child support for her daughter. His spouse has a minimum-\nwage job as a school-bus monitor for children with special needs.    \n \nBefore his current job, Applicant had a full-time job as an assembler from \nSeptember 2014 to March 2016. Before that, he worked as a contractor from June 2014 \nto September 2014. Before that, he worked as an installer from March 2013 to June \n2014. And before that, he was unemployed and a full-time student as noted above. \n \nThe SOR concerns a history of financial problems consisting of failure to timely \nfile state income tax returns for tax years 2014 and 2016; failure to timely file federal \nincome tax returns for tax years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2016; $668 in back taxes \nowed to the IRS for tax year 2015; and a delinquent student loan account charged-off in \nthe amount of $8,426. Department Counsel agreed that Applicant was not required to \nfile tax returns for tax years 2011 and 2012, because Applicant was then a full-time \nstudent and did not have earned income subject to taxation. (Tr. 43-44) This fact was \n\n \n3 \n \nalso established by tax records for those years. (Exhibits A-D) Accordingly, tax years \n2011 and 2012 are not discussed further herein. In both his answer to the SOR and in \nhis hearing testimony, he attributed his tax problems to immaturity, ignorance, and \napathy. (Tr. 32, 49) He attributed his charged-off student loan to an inability to obtain \nemployment in the technology field after earning his degree in December 2012. He then \nworked a series of minimum-wage jobs that did not provide sufficient income to repay \nthe loan.  \n \nApplicant is now in compliance with both federal and state tax authorities. Those \nmatters are discussed below, beginning with the federal tax matters. \n \nApplicant failed to timely file a federal income tax return for tax year 2013. \n(Exhibit E) He eventually filed a return on March 9, 2015; he was issued a refund of \n$981; and he had an IRS account balance of $0 as of April 2015.  \n \nApplicant failed to timely file a federal income tax return for tax year 2014. \n(Exhibits F and M) He eventually filed a return on December 5, 2017. He was accessed \npenalties for not pre-paying tax, for the past-due return, and for late payment of tax. An \noverpayment from tax year 2017 was applied to tax year 2014 in May 2018. He \nreceived a $703 refund for tax year 2014. He had an IRS account balance of $0 as of \nMay 2018.  \n \nApplicant timely filed a federal income tax return for tax year 2015 on April 15, \n2016. (Exhibits H and N) He was accessed penalties for late payment of tax. He had a \npast-due balance of $668 as of November 2017. He made two payments, in June and \nSeptember 2017, for a total of $1,181. The IRS applied a $520 refund due to an \noverpayment for tax year 2015 in September 2017. He had an IRS account balance of \n$0 as of December 2017. \n \nApplicant failed to timely file a federal income tax return for tax year 2016. \n(Exhibits I and O) He requested and received an extension to file on October 15, 2017. \nHe eventually filed a return on December 5, 2017. He had a past-due balance of $1,191 \nas of October 2017. He had an IRS account balance of $0 as of May 2018.  \n \nApplicant timely filed a federal income tax return for tax year 2017, which was the \nmost recent tax year as of the September 2018 hearing. (Exhibit P) He filed the return \non April 15, 2018. He had an IRS account balance of $0 as of May 2018.  \n \nApplicant wrote in his answer to the SOR that he eventually filed a state income \ntax return for tax year 2014 around November 22, 2017, which was untimely, and he \nlearned that he owed $586 in back taxes. He contacted the state tax authority in \nJanuary 2018 and arranged a monthly payment of $28 beginning in May 2018. He \nfurther wrote that he filed a state return for tax year 2016 around November 2017, which \nwas also untimely, and he owed no further tax. He contacted the state tax authority in \nSeptember 2018, and received confirmation by e-mail that the past-due balance for tax \nyear 2014 was paid, and there was no balance due on his account. (Exhibit G) After the \nhearing, he provided a certificate of compliance/letter of good standing from the state \n\n \n4 \n \ntax authority, dated September 26, 2018, which shows he has filed returns and paid all \ntaxes due. (Exhibit Q)  \n \nApplicant has just started repaying the charged-off student loan for $8,426. \n(Exhibit J) About a month before the hearing in August 2018, he entered into a payment \narrangement with the lender to pay $20 monthly on the 18th of every month. He had \nmade one payment per the agreement at the time of the hearing. He also made a $25 \npayment shortly after he received the SOR. (Tr. 41-42) Altogether, he estimated making \nless than $500 in total payments on his total student loan obligations since he was \nawarded his degree in December 2012. (Tr. 41) A September 2018 credit report \npresented by Applicant shows he has several more student loan accounts (nine by my \ncount) that are 120-days or more past due. (Exhibit L)  \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \n                                                          \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n\n \n5 \n \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income \ntax as required;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n                                                          \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.  \n \n \nTurning to the matters in mitigation, it appears the genesis of Applicant\u2019s \nindebtedness was a series of minimum-wage jobs after completing his technical \neducation in December 2012. That went on until he began his current job in 2016. The \nresult was he lacked the means to service his student loan. Nevertheless, his under \nemployment did not prevent him from timely filing state and federal income tax returns. \nGiven these circumstances, the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(c) applies, but only in \npart, and Applicant receives some credit in mitigation.  \n \n \nConcerning the charged-off student loan for more than $8,000, Applicant has not \nyet made \u201ca good-faith effort\u201d to resolve the debt. He defaulted on the account years \nago and only made a payment arrangement with the lender shortly before the hearing. \nDoing so is the first step in the right direction, but it is too soon to tell if Applicant will \nadhere to the repayment arrangement. Given these circumstances, the mitigating \ncondition at AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant made good progress in resolving the tax matters, and he is now in \ncompliance with both federal and state tax authorities. That means he has filed all tax \nreturns, as required, and he has paid all taxes due, as required. And he did a good job \ndocumenting his compliance.  \n \n \nIn addressing this issue, I note that an applicant\u2019s failure to timely file tax returns \nand pay tax when due bears close examination and is a matter of serious concern to the \nfederal government. Here, I am concerned about the duration of Applicant\u2019s tax \nproblems (multiple tax years) and the timing of his remedial action. Applicant failed to \ntimely file state income tax returns for two tax years, and he failed to timely file federal \nincome tax returns for three tax years. He has been in compliance since the December \n2017-May 2018 timeframe, and he filed his federal return for tax year 2017 on a timely \nbasis in April 2018. Still, it is too soon to tell if he will continue to meet his tax obligations \non a timely basis. Given these circumstances, the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(g) \napplies, but the evidence is not sufficient to justify complete mitigation of his long-\nstanding irresponsibility in failing to meet his lawful tax obligations.    \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he \nhas not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \n\n \n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a -- 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on November 16, \n2016 in connection with his employment in the defense industry. On November 8, 2017, \nthe Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline B \nfor foreign influence. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) implemented on June 8, 2017. \n01/31/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 3, 2017, and requested a hearing. \nThe case was assigned to me on June 27, 2018. The hearing was initially scheduled for \nSeptember 20, 2018, but that hearing date was cancelled on August 7, 2018 because of \nApplicant\u2019s travel issues. On October 10, 2018, a hearing notice was issued \nrescheduling the hearing for December 17, 2018.  \n \n  \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. Department Counsel offered Applicant\u2019s \nSCA as Government Exhibit (GE) 1, and it was admitted without objection. The \nGovernment\u2019s request for Administrative Notice (AN) was marked as AN I. Applicant \nand one witness testified. He offered Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A \u2013 H, which were \nadmitted without objection.1  \n \nI left the record open until January 22, 2019 to provide Applicant the opportunity \nto submit additional evidence, which he did, on January 15, 2019. His three post-\nhearing documents, all letters of recommendation, are marked collectively as AE I, and \nadmitted without objection. The record closed on January 15, 2019, when Applicant \nindicated he had no further documents to submit. The transcript (Tr.) was received on \nJanuary 2, 2019. \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nI took administrative notice of facts concerning Afghanistan. Department Counsel \nprovided supporting documents that verify, detail, and provide context for certain \nrequested facts. The specific facts noticed are included in the Findings of Fact. \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings.2 Usually administrative notice in ISCR proceedings is \naccorded to facts that are either well known or from U.S. Government reports.3  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.d, and partially \nadmitted and partially denied SOR \u00b6 1.e, all with explanations.4 His admissions and \nother statements are incorporated into the findings of fact.

(Answer; Tr. 12) \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant is 34 years old. He was born in Afghanistan in 1984. He graduated \nfrom high school in Afghanistan in 2004. He worked for defense contractors with U.S. \nmilitary forces in Afghanistan from 2005 until he came to the United States under the \nspecial immigrant visa program in 2009, and became a permanent resident of the U.S. \nsoon thereafter. He became a U.S. citizen in October 2016, and holds a U.S. passport. \nHis Afghan passport expired in 2015. He is no longer a citizen of Afghanistan. (Tr. 32-\n33, 62-64; GE 1) \n \n \nSince he came to the U.S., Applicant has largely worked in the defense industry, \nboth before and after he became a U.S. citizen. He began working for his current \nemployer in 2009. He deployed to Afghanistan from April 2010 to August 2012 and \nworked with U.S. forces. After taking time off, he redeployed to Afghanistan from \nFebruary 2013 to November 2014. He was then laid off because his company had no \nwork for permanent U.S. residents. He was unemployed in the U.S. for several months \nbefore finding work outside the defense industry. (Tr. 34-39, 62-64; GE 1) \n \n \nApplicant resumed working for his current employer in 2016, when he submitted \nhis SCA. He redeployed to Afghanistan as a linguist and translator in January 2017. He \nremained there until December 2018. He has never held a clearance before. (Tr. 6, 15, \n60-65; GE 1)  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges foreign influence security concerns due to Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers who are citizens and residents of Afghanistan, specifically his parents, a \nsister, five brothers, and a brother-in-law. Applicant\u2019s family lives in a major city in \nAfghanistan. Their details are as follows:   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother: (SOR \u00b6 1.b) She passed away in early December 2018, three \ndays after Applicant returned to the U.S. on leave. He did not return to Afghanistan for \nher funeral. (Tr. 31, 65, Answer; GE 1) Understandably, Applicant has spoken to his \nfather and his siblings frequently since then, including two days before the hearing. (Tr. \n41, 66) SOR \u00b6 1.b is found for Applicant, since his mother is deceased. (Tr. 95) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father: (SOR \u00b6 1.a) He is in his mid-70s. He retired about 25 years \nago as a colonel in the Afghan army. He collects a monthly pension. Applicant usually \ncontacts his father monthly. His father has never visited the United States. (Tr. 40-43, \n48, 70; Answer; GE 1) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister and brother-in-law (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e) Applicant\u2019s sister, age 39, \nis a housewife. She is married to Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law, who is also his cousin. He \nis about 45 years old, and is an officer in the Afghan army, assigned to a training facility. \nHe was recently promoted from major (as alleged) to lieutenant colonel. Applicant has \nlittle direct contact with him, though he speaks to his sister every three or four months. \nThrough his oldest brother, he sends her money (less than $100) every few months. \nThey have never visited the United States. (Tr. 43-44, 48, 54, 69-70) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s oldest brother: Applicant is in closest contact with his oldest brother, \nat least once a month, sometimes more. Applicant sends him money to be distributed to \nhis other siblings. This brother is married and has several children. He formerly owned a \nhotel and a restaurant but now drives a taxi. He has no military or government \naffiliations. (Tr. 48-51, 67; Answer; GE 1) \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s second older brother: He owns a small shop near his other family \nmembers. He has no military or government affiliations. He is married with several \nchildren. Applicant contacts him every four to six months to check on his well-being, and \noccasionally sends money for his children ($100). (Tr. 50-51; Answer; GE 1) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s third older brother: He worked with U.S. forces as a local interpreter \nfrom 2009 to 2011, when he was wounded on a mission. He lives at home with his \nfather. He is seeking to come to the U.S. on a special immigrant visa. Applicant contacts \nhim about every two months. (Tr. 51-52; Answer; GE 1)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s two younger brothers. One brother recently graduated from college \nand started a job for an American company, working in Afghanistan. Applicant\u2019s \nyoungest brother is still in college. Neither is married, and they have no children. \nApplicant speaks to them about every two months. (Tr. 52-53; Answer; GE 1)  \n \n \nDuring his prior deployments, Applicant earned as much as $185,000 annually. \nHe estimated that he sent his family between about $50,000 and $65,000 between 2010 \nand 2014. He paid to renovate his parents\u2019 house in Afghanistan, and he sent money to \none of his brothers as an engagement and wedding present, which the brother used to \nbuy a car. Since then, he has not sent them nearly as much money. In 2017, he sent his \nfamily about $600. In 2018, he and his girlfriend sent his father about $2,000. (Tr. 42, \n53-54, 73) \n \n \nApplicant testified that his family members know that he is deployed to \nAfghanistan, but they do not know what he does. He is not allowed to visit them while \non duty because he is not authorized to leave the base. Applicant has visited his family \nwhen he is on leave. He is not allowed to visit his family while on his current contract, so \nhe will not see them after his return to Afghanistan after the hearing. (Tr. 44-47, 66-69) \n \n \nApplicant owns no property in Afghanistan and he has no assets there. He may \ninherit a share of his father\u2019s house one day, like his other siblings. He is registered to \nvote in the U.S. He has money in the U.S. stock market through an investment account, \nwhich he valued at about $100,000. His pay is deposited into a U.S. bank account. \nApplicant\u2019s U.S. home of record is his girlfriend\u2019s parents\u2019 house. (Tr. 57-60, 71, 72) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s girlfriend, age 37, is a naturalized U.S. citizen from Afghanistan. She \ncame to the U.S. with her parents and siblings as a child, in 1990. She became a U. S. \ncitizen in 2008, and holds a U.S. passport. Her parents and two of her four brothers are \nalso naturalized U.S. citizens. Since leaving as a child, she has never been back to \nAfghanistan, though she has extended family there. She has spoken to several of \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s Afghan family members by phone. She has a bachelor\u2019s degree. She helps \nher mother, who owns a hair salon. (Tr. 80-88)  \n \n \nApplicant and his girlfriend met online and have been together since August \n2013. She testified that he is dedicated, patient, fair, and loving. He is trustworthy and \nreliable. (Tr. 80-84) She said he took the job in Afghanistan to help them build for the \nfuture. (Tr. 88-89)  \n \n \nApplicant supplied strong character references from several U.S. military officers \nwho served with him in Afghanistan, often on a daily basis, both several years ago, and \nrecently. All attested to his professional skill and high value as an interpreter, cultural \nadvisor, and trusted team member. They universally attest to his loyalty, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. (AE B - AE F. AE I) Applicant also submitted several certificates of \nappreciation and training certificates, detailing his hard work, dedication, and exemplary \nperformance. (AE A, AE G, AE H) \n \nAdministrative Notice-Afghanistan5 \n \n \nThe U.S. State Department warns U.S. citizens not to travel to Afghanistan due \nto crime, terrorism, civil unrest, and armed conflict. Extremists associated with various \nTaliban networks, the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant, and members of other armed \nopposition groups are active throughout the country. Afghanistan continues to \nexperience aggressive and coordinated attacks by the Taliban and other terrorist \ngroups. The border region between Afghanistan and Pakistan remains a safe haven for \nterrorists. The country\u2019s most significant human-rights concerns are widespread \nviolence, armed insurgent groups\u2019 attacks on civilians, and killing of persons affiliated \nwith the government.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n                                                          \n5 AN I. All of the excerpts cited in the Government\u2019s administrative notice filing are from U.S. Government \ndocuments published in 2017. Many have since been updated, including the most recent travel advisory \nfor \nAfghanistan, \nhttps://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/afghanistan-\nadvisory.html, published July 9, 2018; the  2017 U.S. State Department Human Rights report for \nAfghanistan (https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/277519.pdf), and the 2017 State Department \nCountry Reports on Terrorism, Chapter 2: South and Central Asia (including Afghanistan) \n(https://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/crt/2017/282845.htm). I take administrative notice of certain more recent \n(but largely similar) facts in these updated reports, consistent with my obligation to make assessments \nbased on timely information in cases involving foreign influence. \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d as \nfollows:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \n\n \n7 \n \n \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology.  \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human-rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment, a family member or friend is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, the country is known to conduct intelligence collection operations against \nthe United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism. The \nrelationship between Afghanistan and the United States places a significant, but not \ninsurmountable, burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationships \nwith his relatives living in Afghanistan do not pose a security risk. Applicant should not \nbe placed in a position where he might be forced to choose between loyalty to the \nUnited States and a desire to assist his relatives living in Afghanistan who might be \ncoerced by governmental or non-governmental entities, or pressured to assist \nAfghanistan.  \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d6 Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound \ndisagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to their vital \n                                                          \n6 ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \ninterests or national security. Finally, friendly nations are known to have engaged in \nespionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and \ntechnical fields.  \n \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives from Afghanistan have \nsought classified or economic information from or through Applicant or his relatives \nliving in Afghanistan it is not possible to rule out such a possibility in the future. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n7(a) and 7(b) apply based upon Applicant\u2019s family members who are residents and \ncitizens of Afghanistan. \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns, \nincluding:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; and \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest.  \n \nApplicant has several immediate family members remaining in Afghanistan, and \nhe remains in close contact with them. He has provided them financial support. \nApplicant\u2019s father is a retired Afghan Army officer and Applicant has limited direct \ncontact with his brother-in-law, also an Army officer there. No other relatives have \ngovernment or military connections. One brother was wounded while working with U.S. \nforces.  \n \nSince 2005, Applicant has spent many years working with U.S. forces in \nAfghanistan, both before and after he came to the U.S. on a special immigrant visa in \n2009, and before and after he became a U.S. citizen in 2016. I give this evidence \nsignificant weight, given his many years of service to the U.S. military and to U.S. \ninterests in Afghanistan, in difficult, dangerous conditions. Applicant testified credibly \nthat he abides by the rules and does not visit his family in Afghanistan if it is not \npermitted. With his mother\u2019s recent passing, in December 2018, his contact with his \nfamily members increased, though this is perfectly understandable under the sad \ncircumstances. Applicant does not intend to return to Afghanistan to live. He has begun \nto build a life in the United States with his girlfriend.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nWhile he has numerous relatives in Afghanistan, Applicant presented sufficient \nevidence to establish that it is unlikely that he would be placed in a position to choose \nbetween the interest of his relatives living in Afghanistan and those of the United States. \nAG \u00b6 8(a) applies. \n \nApplicant has met his burden to establish his \u201cdeep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d He immigrated to this country in 2009 on a \nspecial immigrant visa after working for several years with U.S. forces in Afghanistan. \nHis brave and highly valuable work with U.S. forces has continued, both stateside and \nin Afghanistan, including through several long deployments. Numerous U.S. military \nofficers who served with him closely attest to his loyalty, dedication, and overall \ntrustworthiness. The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has longstanding \nties to the United States and would resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United \nStates. AG \u00b6 8(b) applies. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The circumstances tending to \nsupport granting Applicant\u2019s clearance are more significant than the factors weighing \ntowards denying his clearance. I considered the recommendations of the U.S. military \nofficers who have served with him and who recommend him highly. I also considered \nhis strong ties to this country, as shown most strongly by his long service overseas. He \nhas demonstrated his longstanding loyalty to the United States. Therefore, he provided \nsufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns.  \n \nOverall the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \n\n \n10 \n \n \nconclude that the security concerns arising under Guideline B, foreign influence \nconcerns are mitigated. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nBraden M.

Glassman, Esquire \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMARSHALL, Jr., Arthur E., Administrative Judge: \n    Statement of the Case \nOn February 2, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline G (Alcohol \nConsumption), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).1 \nOn April 19, 2018, Applicant timely submitted a response in which he requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA). I was assigned the case on September 12, 2018. The Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on October 17, 2018, \nsetting the hearing for December 6, 2018. The hearing was convened as scheduled.  \nThe Government offered eight documents, accepted without objection as exhibits \n(Exs.) A-H. Applicant offered testimony and four documents, accepted without objection \nas Exs. 12-15, and appended with exhibits (pre-marked by Applicant as Exs. 1-11) \npreviously submitted with the SOR Response. The transcript (Tr.) was received on \n1 The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) effective within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017.  \n03/28/2019\n\n \n \n \n \n2 \nDecember 13, 2018, and the record was closed. Based on the exhibits, testimony, and \nrecord as a whole, I find Applicant mitigated all security concerns.   \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old male with medical training received in the military. He \nis currently unemployed with a job offer pending from a defense contractor. Applicant \nhonorably served in the United States military for over 24 years, mostly spent as a \nspecial forces medic with a top secret security clearance. He has taken a number of \ncollege-level courses and completed a medical certification program. He is currently \nseparated from his third spouse. \n \n \nIn January 2004, when he was serving in the military, Applicant and colleagues \nwere celebrating the completion of a three-year course. Driving in his new Mustang after \nleaving a bar, he was caught driving 90 miles per hour in a 50 miles-per-hour-speed-\nlimit. He did not realize how fast he was going. His blood alcohol concentration (BAC) \nlevel measured at 0.18. and he was arrested for driving while impaired (DWI). He was \nreprimanded through the military with a general officer memorandum. He was neither \nordered to seek, nor sought, treatment or counseling after the incident. \n \n \nIn 2014, around the time he was honorably discharged from the military, \nApplicant and his now-estranged wife prepared to move to a new state so he could \napply to a particular academic program. His wife\u2019s ex-husband objected to her taking \ntheir children out of state, and a court order made her return them so the ex-husband \ncould continue visitation rights until a hearing could be held. The wife and children \nreturned, but the hearing was postponed. Meanwhile, Applicant remained in the new \nstate until the court finally convened and declared the family could not move the \nchildren away. Once reunited, Applicant found it difficult to find a job, although his wife \nhad found work relatively quickly. Having to be at the dictates of his wife\u2019s \u201cterrible\u201d ex-\nhusband \u201cbroke her spirit. . . . she\u2019s never been the same, still now. And she started \nisolating herself. [She and Applicant] weren\u2019t communicating.\u201d (Tr. 23) Applicant was \nunsure what was happening to them and he began drinking alcohol more often.  \n \nIn January 2016, Applicant went to the basement to remind his 17-year-old \nstepson not to be \u201cvaping\u201d in the house, and to focus more on his studies than on sitting \naround playing Internet games with his friends. The stepson ignored Applicant, but \ncontinued chatting with his friends. Applicant unplugged the television set the boy was \nwatching. The stepson, a wrestler, jumped on Applicant and the two wrestled. This led \nto the teen suffering an injury to his lip, which bled. Applicant\u2019s wife broke up the fracas. \nApplicant ultimately left the room, at which point the teenager called the police. \nApplicant was eventually arrested and charged with assault. Two hours later, he \nreturned home.  Considering this to be an internal, domestic issue between stepfather \nand teen, Applicant wanted to contain or avoid the problem, and pled guilty to simple \nassault in March 2017. He was sentenced to 45 days in confinement (suspended 12 \nmonths), 12 months probation (unsupervised), $100 fine, and required to complete an \n\n \n \n \n \n3 \nanger management class.2 He also completed two months of substance abuse \ncounseling. (Tr. 48-50) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s effort, however, did not help his eroding relationship with the teen\u2019s \nmother. Applicant and his now-estranged wife separated a week or so later. Living apart \nand bored from not working, Applicant began to drink more. Then, one night in February \n2016, Applicant was bored, alone, and having alcoholic beverages by himself when his \nspouse asked him to come over. Hopeful at this development, he prepared to go. \n \nDespite the fact he had been imbibing and knew he \u201cwasn\u2019t really in a good \ncondition to drive,\u201d Applicant got into his car. (Tr. 29) On his way, he was pulled over by \npolice on his way to see her. Applicant was charged with driving while impaired (DWI) \nwith a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level measured at 0.17. He pled guilty to the \ncharge in March 2017.  \n \n \nSince that time, Applicant does not consider alcohol to be a factor in his life, \nalthough he continues to consume alcohol. (Tr. 40) He completed counseling in March \n2018, where it was recommended he attend a minimum of two Alcoholics Anonymous \n(AA) meetings a week in addition to group counseling. He attended \u201ca few\u201d meetings, \nbut \u201cit\u2019s difficult to find one that you actually like just because of the people that are in \nthere, so I tried a couple of different ones, recorded it, and that was it.\u201d (Tr. 42)  He\u2019s \nreplaced boredom in his life with enjoying the nature abundant in his current region and \nin getting to know his biological family, whom he discovered a year ago in the same \narea in which he now lives. (Tr. 41) These finds have brought joy to his life and have \nalleviated his boredom. Now, he generally only drinks while watching sports games on \ntelevision with his brother. He is mindful not to drive after imbibing.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. They are applied in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto the AG, the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person in making a decision. \n \n                                                          \n2 The anger management component was satisfied by visiting a psychologist about multiple issues over a \ncouple of months (March-May 2016), including anger, his marriage, and alcohol. (Tr. 49) \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4 \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. The AG \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder the Directive, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. In addition, an applicant is responsible for \npresenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts \nadmitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the \nnational interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe alcohol consumption guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21:  \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related DWIs in 2004 and in 2016, when he excessively \nconsumed alcohol to the point of impaired judgment before driving a car, establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving \nwhile under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the \npeace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the \nindividual's alcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of \nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder.  \n \nThe security concerns raised under this guideline have been mitigated by the \nfollowing applicable factors:  \n\n \n \n \n \n5 \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or judgment;  \n \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 23(d): the individual has successfully completed a treatment \nprogram along with any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear \nand established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in \naccordance with treatment recommendations.  \n \nApplicant acknowledged that he exercised extremely poor judgment by driving a \nvehicle after having consumed alcohol to the point of intoxication in 2004 and 2016. He \nhas twice experienced the time and expense of being subjected to charges related to \ndrinking and driving. While he still consumes alcohol, he has learned to limit his \nimbibing to in-home activities where he does not drive after drinking. This drinking is at \nhome watching sports with his new-found brother. He no longer drinks out of depression \nor boredom. He now fills his idle hours with visiting his newly discovered biological \nfamily members and enjoying nature. In short, he has demonstrated a pattern of \nresponsible consumption of alcohol. In the past three years, he has demonstrated a \nsufficient pattern of modified behavior for me to conclude that the questionable \njudgment associated with his alcohol consumption and driving is behind him.  \n \nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe concern raised by criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s 2016 assault conviction establishes the following disqualifying \ncondition: \n \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, \nan admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, \nregardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or \nconvicted.  \n \nThe security concerns raised under this guideline have been mitigated by the following \napplicable factors: \n\n \n \n \n \n6 \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 32(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement.  \n \nApplicant no longer lives with the stepson with whom he wrestled in the January \n2016 fracas. They apparently resumed the not atypical, often fractious, teen vs. step-\nparent relationship without further incident. Indeed, at present, their relationship is \ncomparatively distant due to Applicant\u2019s separation from the mother. Applicant \ncompleted the sentence imposed, and received psychological counseling that \naddressed a wide-ranging variety of issues, from anger management, family problems, \nand alcohol. Applicant has demonstrated a sufficient pattern of modified behavior for me \nto conclude that the criminal conduct and questionable judgment associated the assault \nat issue is a thing of the past.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Here, Applicant admits both  the 2004 and 2016 DWIs, and that he got \ninto an argument with his stepson in 2016 that resulted in simple assault. This is \nsufficient to raise disqualifying condition: \n \nAG \u00b6 16(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, or duress by a foreign \nintelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct includes: (1) \nengaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s persona, \nprofessional, or community standing. . . .  \n \n \nThis guideline provides seven potential mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17. Two \nare potentially applicable under these facts: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \n\n \n \n \n \n7 \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur.  \n \n \nWith regard to AG \u00b6 17(c), Applicant has moderated his drinking since his 2016 \nDWI. The same period has passed without a recurrence of any criminal activity similar \nto the 2016 simple assault that occurred with his stepson. Applicant acknowledges the \nfacts and takes responsibility for his actions. He completed all aspects of his sentences, \nincluding psychological counseling that addressed several aspects of his then-present \nproblems, such as anger, marital issues, and alcohol. Today, he maintains an even \nkeel, no longer lives with the troublesome teen, monitors his alcohol use, and fills his \nempty hours with his family and nature. His drinking is now limited to sports time \ntelevision in the company of his brother. I find AG \u00b6 17(c) and AG \u00b6 17(d) apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under the three \napplicable guidelines in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s highly \ncredible testimony, his past military service while maintaining a security clearance, \nbehavioral changes, maturation, and marital separation. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8 \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude alcohol \nconsumption, criminal conduct, and personal conduct security concerns are mitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

Nerney, Esq. \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGLENDON, John Bayard, Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). \nApplicant has family members who are citizens and residents of Pakistan. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 10, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guideline B. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended \n(Exec. Or.); DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016), for all adjudicative decisions on or after \nJune 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on October 12, 2018. He requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was originally assigned to another judge and \n03/29/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nthen was reassigned to me on December 12, 2018. On the same day, the Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing scheduling the hearing on \nJanuary 10, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled.  \n \nDepartment Counsel offered two documents into evidence, which were marked as \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2. These exhibits were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. She also offered the Government\u2019s request for administrative notice regarding \nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan (Pakistan). Applicant had no objection to Department \nCounsel\u2019s request. Applicant testified and offered ten exhibits, which were marked as \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through J. Department Counsel had no objection. All exhibits \nwere admitted into the record. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nJanuary 25, 2019.  \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice  \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout Pakistan. (HE 1) The facts administratively noticed are summarized in the Findings \nof Fact, below. \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nApplicant is a 65-year-old software developer. He has worked for his current \nsecurity clearance sponsor since about April 2018. He worked for a different federal \ncontactor when he submitted his application for a clearance (SCA) on November 25, \n2015. He was granted a security clearance in 1984 and again in 2002. He also worked \nfor the Federal Aviation Administration for about 13 years (approximately 1986-1999). (Tr. \n15-17.) \n \n \nApplicant was born in Pakistan and entered the United States in September 1972 \nat the age of 18. He married a U.S. citizen in 1974 and divorced in 1977. He remarried \nanother American citizen in 1977 and divorced again in 1983. In December 1977, they \nhad one child. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1982. He attended college in the \nUnited States, and in 1984, he received his bachelor\u2019s degree in computer engineering. \nIn 1989, he married an Indian-born woman in Pakistan. Her father is deceased, but was \na Pakistani citizen. Her mother is a citizen and resident of Pakistan. His wife subsequently \nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen. They have three adult children, who were all born in \nthe United States. Applicant has several U.S.-born grandchildren and a U.S.-born great-\ngrandchild. (Tr. 12-14; SCA 7, 10, 16, 31, and 36.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father died in about 1989. He was a Pakistani citizen. He worked as an \naccountant for a private developer prior to his death. His mother is a dual U.S. and \nPakistani citizen. Applicant sponsored her to immigrate to the United States in the late \n1980s and to become a U.S. citizen. She has been a housewife her entire life and is now \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application, dated June 20, 2017, \n(GE 1), unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n\n \n3 \n \n82 years old. She sponsored two of her three sons, Applicant\u2019s brothers, to immigrate to \nthe United States. They have become U.S. citizens, as well. Applicant has one other \nbrother and six sisters, who are citizens and residents of Pakistan. Applicant\u2019s mother \nreturned to Pakistan due to her health and lives with Applicant\u2019s brother and one of his \nsisters. Applicant\u2019s sisters take care of her in her old age. (Tr. 18-19; SCA 19-20, 23-24, \n26-27, 32, and 42-43.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law has been a housewife her entire life. She is almost 80 \nyears old. He does not speak with her due to a disagreement. He last spoke with her in \n2015 or 2016. Since then, Applicant\u2019s wife has also not spoken with her mother. \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law was a civil engineer. Applicant\u2019s wife has travelled to Pakistan \non two occasions since he married her in 1989 and brought her to the United States. (Tr. \n30-32 and 43-4; SCA 31.) \n \n \nSince arriving in the United States in 1972, Applicant travelled to Pakistan twice, \nonce in 1982, after becoming a U.S. citizen and again in 2015 for less than 10 days to \nvisit with most of his family. He made the trip with one of his American brothers and was \nunemployed at the time. Applicant\u2019s wife did not accompany him. He did not visit with any \nnon-family members during that trip. He did not return to Pakistan for the funeral of his \nfather in 1989. He does not plan to attend the funeral of his mother or any other relative \nin the future for practical reasons. He has no plans to return to Pakistan for any reason in \nthe future. He speaks or otherwise communicates with his mother every few months. He \nlast saw her in Pakistan during his 2015 trip. His mother does not know that he is seeking \na security clearance from the U.S. Government. (Tr. 14-15, 19-20, 31-32, 36, 39, and 45.) \n \n \nApplicant has even less contact with his Pakistani siblings. All of his sisters are \nhomemakers. None of their husbands work for the Pakistani government or military. His \nbrother in Pakistan works for a private, Pakistani resort company. Applicant \ncommunicates with his sisters and his brother in Pakistan very infrequently. He has not \ntalked to any of his siblings since his 2015 visit. Also, Applicant maintains no friendships \nwith anyone in Pakistan. (Tr. 22-27, 28-30, 37-38, and 40.) \n \n \nApplicant has no assets in Pakistan. All of his assets, including his home, which \nhe has owned since 2002, are in the United States. He does not have a Pakistani \npassport, and he does not consider himself to be a Pakistani citizen. He also submitted a \nsubstantial amount of character evidence attesting to his loyalty and dedication to the \ninterests of the United States. (Tr. 46; SCA 9; AE A, E, H, I, and J.) \n \nPakistan \n \nThe U.S. State Department warns U.S. citizens to reconsider travel to Pakistan \ndue to terrorism. Travel by U.S. Government personnel within Pakistan is restricted. \nTerrorist groups continue to pose a danger to U.S. citizens throughout Pakistan, and \nevidence suggests that some victims of terrorist activity were targeted because they are \nAmericans. Although al-Qaida in Pakistan has been degraded, its global leadership \ncontinued to operate from remote locations in the region that the group has historically \n\n \n4 \n \nexploited for safe haven. Pakistan has not taken substantial action against the Afghan \nTaliban or Haqqani Network, or substantially limit their ability to threaten U.S. interests in \nAfghanistan. Pakistan has also not taken sufficient action against other externally focused \nterrorist groups such as Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad, which continued to \noperate, train, organize, and fundraise in Pakistan. \n \nThe U.S. State Department\u2019s 2017 Human Rights Report for Pakistan indicates \nthat the most serious human rights problems in Pakistan were the following: (1) \nextrajudicial and targeted killings; (2) disappearances; (3) torture; (4) lack of rule of law; \n(5) poor implementation and enforcement of laws; and (6) frequent mob violence and \nvigilante justice with limited accountability. Other human rights problems included \narbitrary detention, lengthy pretrial detention, governmental infringement on citizens\u2019 \nprivacy rights, a weak criminal justice system, and a lack of judicial independence in the \nlower courts, and harassment of journalists. There were government restrictions on \nfreedom of assembly and limits on freedom of movement. Government practices and \ncertain laws limited freedom of religion, particularly for religious minorities. Corruption \nwithin the government and police, as well as discrimination against women and girls \nremained serious problems. The authorities seldom punished government officials for \nhuman rights violations.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe SOR sets forth four allegations under Guideline B regarding Applicant\u2019s \nmother, brother, six sisters and mother-in-law who are all citizens and residents of \nPakistan. The security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6, as follows: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual maybe manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and  \n \nAG \u00b67(e): shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  \n \nThe Government\u2019s evidence has established that Applicant\u2019s foreign \ncontacts, as well as his wife\u2019s, create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. These relationships also \nconstitute connections to foreign persons that creates a potential conflict of interest \nbetween Applicant\u2019s obligation to protect classified or sensitive information or \ntechnology and Applicant\u2019s desire to help family members and his mother-in-law. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e) apply to Applicant\u2019s relationships with the foreign \ncontacts and connections alleged in the SOR. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant has established that AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(b) and 8(c) fully apply. He has lived in the \nUnited States since 1972, basically all of his adult life. Though he eventually married a \nwoman of Pakistani descent in 1989, they have raised their family in the United States as \nAmericans. He is now the proud patriarch of three generations of U.S. descendants. He \nraised his family in a home in the United States that he has owned at least 2002. All of \nhis assets are in the United States; he has no assets in Pakistan. He has only visited \nPakistan twice since immigrating to the United States in 1972. He has no present intention \nto return to Pakistan. He received his college education in this country, and has made a \ncareer based upon that education. He worked for a federal government agency for 13 \nyears and has twice been granted security clearances to work for the government in a \nclassified setting.  \n \nThe facts of this case do not present a conflict of interest. Applicant\u2019s sense of \nloyalties or obligations to his foreign family member\u2019s and his wife\u2019s mother is minimal, \nand he has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States \nthat he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. His \nrelationships with his immediate family members in Pakistan, including his mother, can \nbest be described as casual and infrequent. He and his wife have no relationship with his \nwife\u2019s mother due to their estrangement from her.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).2  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under these guidelines and \nevaluating all of the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns raised by his foreign contacts and connections. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n2 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding \nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for \nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of \ncontinuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline H and cross-alleges under Guideline J (SOR \u00b6 2.a) that Applicant used marijuana from approximately 2008 through 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and that he was arrested and charged with possession of drug paraphernalia in January 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and possession of marijuana in August 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Applicant was also alleged under Guideline J to have been arrested and charged with evading responsibility with damage or injury in March 2017 (SOR \u00b6 2.b). When Applicant answered the SOR, he admitted that he had used marijuana as a teenager \u201cat a few parties from peer pressure.\u201d He denied that he was arrested in 2016, and explained that he was issued citations in each instance. He pleaded not guilty because the drug paraphernalia and marijuana did not belong to him. He admitted that he had been arrested and charged with evading responsibility in March 2017 \u201cbecause of a hostile girlfriend and [him] trying to leave the situation before things escalated.\u201d He indicated that he had paid restitution and was in counseling. (Answer.) 3 After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 22-year-old high school graduate with technical school training in auto body work, collision, and repair obtained from August 2013 to December 2015. He has yet to earn a certificate or degree. He needs to complete one credit to raise his grade point average to the 2.0 needed to graduate. (Tr. 49.) He is unma",

Gregorian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant used marijuana approximately once every three weeks with friends from \n2008 to 2014. He was cited for possession of drug paraphernalia in January 2016 and for \npossession of marijuana in August 2016, but claims neither the paraphernalia nor the \nmarijuana belonged to him. In February 2017, he was arrested for evading responsibility in \nan accident causing damage. Applicant has yet to show adequate reform. Clearance is \ndenied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 27, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse, and Guideline J, \ncriminal conduct. The SOR explained why it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF \ntook the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n08/29/2018\n\n2 \n \n(Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective June 8, 2017, \nto all adjudications for national security eligibility or eligibility to hold a sensitive position. \n \nOn January 19, 2018, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). On February 20, 2018, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to \ndetermine whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for Applicant. On February 27, 2018, I scheduled a hearing for March \n22, 2018. With the agreement of the parties, I rescheduled the hearing for March 20, 2018. \n \nI convened the hearing as rescheduled. Three Government exhibits (GEs 1-3) and \ntwo Applicant exhibits (AEs A-B) were admitted into evidence without objection. A February \n14, 2018 letter forwarding discovery of the then proposed GEs to Applicant, a March 9, \n2018 email to Applicant, and a list of the GEs were incorporated in the record as hearing \nexhibits I, II, and III respectively, but not admitted as evidence. Applicant and three \nwitnesses testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on March 28, 2018. \n \nI held the record open initially for three weeks for post-hearing submissions from \nApplicant. On April 2, 2018, Applicant submitted letters from an Employee Assistance \nProgram (EAP) counselor (AE C) and from the coordinator for an anger management \nprogram (AE D), which were received in evidence without any objections. On April 6, 2018, \nApplicant submitted a revised letter from the EAP counselor (AE E), which was admitted in \nevidence. \n \nOn July 11, 2018, Applicant submitted an email indicating that he had just had a \ncourt date and that \u201ceverything is good.\u201d I informed Applicant that, in light of his \ncorrespondence regarding the incident alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.b, I would consider reopening \nthe record for any court record or other document showing the current status of the case. \nApplicant responded that he had no further documents to submit. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline H and cross-alleges under Guideline J (SOR \u00b6 \n2.a) that Applicant used marijuana from approximately 2008 through 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), \nand that he was arrested and charged with possession of drug paraphernalia in January \n2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and possession of marijuana in August 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Applicant was \nalso alleged under Guideline J to have been arrested and charged with evading \nresponsibility with damage or injury in March 2017 (SOR \u00b6 2.b). When Applicant answered \nthe SOR, he admitted that he had used marijuana as a teenager \u201cat a few parties from \npeer pressure.\u201d He denied that he was arrested in 2016, and explained that he was issued \ncitations in each instance. He pleaded not guilty because the drug paraphernalia and \nmarijuana did not belong to him. He admitted that he had been arrested and charged with \nevading responsibility in March 2017 \u201cbecause of a hostile girlfriend and [him] trying to \nleave the situation before things escalated.\u201d He indicated that he had paid restitution and \nwas in counseling. (Answer.) \n \n\n3 \n \n \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 22-year-old high school graduate with technical school training in auto \nbody work, collision, and repair obtained from August 2013 to December 2015. He has yet \nto earn a certificate or degree. He needs to complete one credit to raise his grade point \naverage to the 2.0 needed to graduate. (Tr. 49.) He is unmarried but has a two-year-old \ndaughter, for whom he pays child support of $119 a week. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 23.) He has never \nheld a security clearance. He has been offered employment by a defense contractor that is \ncontingent on him being granted a security clearance. (Tr. 51.) \n \nWhile attending technical school, Applicant worked part time in retail and then for a \nmovie theater. He worked at a restaurant from July 2015 until January 2016, when he \nresigned for a full-time auto body technician position. He left that job in June 2016 because \nhe did not think he was treated fairly, and he returned to work for the restaurant. (GE 1.) \n \nAs part of his application to work for a defense contractor, Applicant completed and \ncertified to the accuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) on July \n8, 2016. He disclosed that he had been arrested in January 2016 for having drug \nparaphernalia in his vehicle, but that the charge was dismissed in April 2016. He listed no \nother arrests and responded negatively to the illegal drug inquiries including the following: \n \nIn the last seven (7) years, have you been involved in the illegal purchase, \nmanufacture, cultivation, trafficking, production, transfer, shipping, receiving, \nhandling or sale of any drug or controlled substance? (GE 1.) \n \n \nOn July 13, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). About his January 2016 arrest, Applicant stated \nthat he was in route home from work when he was stopped for a headlight violation. The \nofficer conducted a search of his vehicle and found a marijuana grinder and bowl. \nApplicant denied that the paraphernalia belonged to him, but the police issued him a \ncitation for $100 with an option to appear in court.1 In February 2016, Applicant was \nadvised that the charge would be dropped if he completed 20 hours of community service, \nwhich he finished in April 2016. He expressed his belief that the charge was dismissed \n                                                 \n1 Under Section 21a-267(d) of his state\u2019s general laws, use or possession of less than a half-ounce of \nmarijuana is an infraction: \n \n(d) No person shall (1) use or possess with intent to use drug paraphernalia to plant, \npropagate, cultivate, grow, harvest, manufacture, compound, convert, produce, process, \nprepare, test, analyze, pack, repack, store, contain or conceal, or to ingest, inhale or \notherwise introduce into the human body, less than one-half ounce of a cannabis-type \nsubstance, or (2) deliver, possess with intent to deliver or manufacture with intent to deliver \ndrug paraphernalia knowing, or under circumstances where one reasonably should know, \nthat it will be used to plant, propagate, cultivate, grow, harvest, manufacture, compound, \nconvert, produce, process, prepare, test, analyze, pack, repack, store, contain or conceal, or \nto ingest, inhale or otherwise introduce into the human body, less than one-half ounce of a \ncannabis-type substance. Any person who violates any provision of this subsection shall have \ncommitted an infraction. \n\n4 \n \nwhen he provided proof to the court of the community service. He stated that the \nparaphernalia had been left in his vehicle by a friend. Applicant then disclosed that he was \nticketed in August 2016 for possession of marijuana and a seatbelt violation. He explained \nthat he was stopped in route home from work, and the police found a small bag of \nmarijuana in his vehicle. Applicant believed that a friend left the drug in his car, and he told \nthe officer that the drug did not belong to him. He was issued a citation with a $175 fine for \nmarijuana possession and $65 for seatbelt violation. He requested a court appearance, \nand indicates that, in October 2016, he was told that the charge would be dropped on \npayment of a $100 \u201ccharitable contribution.\u201d He expressed his belief that the charges were \ndropped after he paid the $100.2 (GE 2.) \n \n \nApplicant then revealed that, in February 2017, he was arrested for misdemeanor \nevading responsibility.3 He was leaving a friend\u2019s home when his girlfriend pulled up beside \nhim in her vehicle. He had called her names on the telephone earlier, and she challenged \nhim to a fight. Applicant refused to exit his vehicle and, while leaving, he \u201caccidently swiped \nthe side of [his girlfriend\u2019s] car.\u201d He did not stop, and later that evening, the police arrested \nhim for evading responsibility. At a court appearance on July 11, 2017, Applicant was \nadvised that a nolle prosequi would be entered in a year if he completed an anger \nmanagement class.4 Applicant admitted that he had yet to look into acceptable anger \nmanagement classes, but he expressed his intention to attend the classes within the year. \nHe denied any intention to engage in criminal behavior in the future because he wanted to \nget a good job and be a good role model for his daughter. (GE 2.) \n \n \nApplicant also acknowledged to the OPM investigator that he should have answered \n\u201cyes\u201d on his SF 86 to the inquiry concerning any illegal drug use in the last seven years. He \nthen detailed that he used marijuana from 2008 to 2014 about once every three weeks with \nhis then friends. He took a few puffs off joints passed to him and did not purchase the drug. \nApplicant used the marijuana to fit in with his friends. He never purchased the drug himself. \nApplicant denied that his marijuana use ever caused him a problem because the 2016 \ncitations occurred after he had ceased using marijuana. Applicant added that after he was \ncited for marijuana possession in August 2016, he stopped associating with the friends \ninvolved in his drug use. Applicant stated that he had no intention of using marijuana in the \nfuture. He explained that he failed to report his marijuana use on his SF 86 because he did \nnot think that marijuana was still illegal.5 (GE 2.) \n                                                 \n2 No citations or court records for either incidents were made available for my review. \n \n3 The March 2017 date alleged in the SOR was the date of his first court appearance. \n  \n4 A nolle prosequi or nolle is a formal entry on the record by a prosecutor by which he or she declares that \nthere will be no further prosecution. \n \n5 Effective July 1, 2011, the state changed the penalty for possessing less than one-half ounce of marijuana \nfrom a potential term of imprisonment and large fine to a fine for a first and subsequent offense. See \u00a7 21a-\n279a, which provides the penalty for illegal possession of small amounts of a cannabis-type substance: \n \n(a) Any person who possesses or has under his control less than one-half ounce of a \ncannabis-type substance, as defined in section 21a-240, except as authorized in this chapter, \n\n5 \n \n \nAvailable information about the February 2017 evading responsibility charge \nindicates that Applicant was granted accelerated rehabilitation in June 2017 with an \nevaluation for anger management and substance abuse. He had \u201cjust made\u201d an \nappointment for his accelerated rehabilitation program and was planning to make an \nappointment for his anger management and substance abuse counseling as of September \n11, 2017. (GE 3.) \n \n \nDOHA gave Applicant an opportunity to review and make any corrections to the \nOPM investigator\u2019s summary report of his July 13, 2017 interview. On November 8, 2017, \nApplicant adopted the investigator\u2019s report as accurate with one addition. He indicated that \nhe had started his anger management classes and counseling \u201cin the past months.\u201d (GE 2. \n \n \nApplicant attended substance abuse counseling through the defense contractor\u2019s \nEmployee Assistance Program (EAP) on September 14, 2017, September 22, 2017, \nOctober 5, 2017, and March 29, 2017. His next session was scheduled for April 12, 2018. \n(AE E.) He had no explanation for why the judge ordered him to complete substance abuse \ncounseling, but he suspected it was for alcohol. He testified that he was in a \u201cdownward \nspiral with [his] relationship, so [he] would just drink.\u201d (Tr. 78.) He also participated in group \nsessions of a men\u2019s anger management program focusing on defining and understanding \ndomestic violence and abusive versus respectful communication. He started on September \n30, 2017, three weeks into a nine-week program, and attended five sessions before it \nended on November 11, 2017. (AE D; Tr. 82.) While the EAP counselor and the program \ncoordinator for the anger management program confirmed his attendance, neither provider \ncommented about his progress. \n \n \nApplicant continues to deny that the drug paraphernalia and marijuana found in his \nvehicle in January 2016 and August 2016 belonged to him. He was not arrested but rather \nwas ticketed. He paid his fine and completed his community service. He testified that he \ncompleted the anger management program required for evading responsibility, even \nthough he attended only five of the nine sessions. He testified that there was no required \nnumber of substance abuse counseling sessions, but that he had attended six sessions. \n(Tr. 45-47.) When asked about a previous admission during his OPM interview that he had \nused marijuana from 2008 to 2014 about every three weeks, Applicant indicated that he \n\u201cjust gave an average time\u201d for the dates. He expressed disbelief that he had told the \ninvestigator he used marijuana about every three weeks, and that there must have been \nsome miscommunication. When asked for his present recollection about the frequency of \n                                                                                                                                                             \nshall (1) for a first offense, be fined one hundred fifty dollars, and (2) for a subsequent \noffense, be fined not less than two hundred dollars or more than five hundred dollars. \n \n(b) The law enforcement officer issuing a complaint for a violation of subsection (a) of this \nsection shall seize the cannabis-type substance and cause such substance to be destroyed \nas contraband in accordance with law. \n \n(c) Any person who, at separate times, has twice entered a plea of nolo contendere to, or \nbeen found guilty after trial of, a violation of subsection (a) of this section shall, upon a \nsubsequent plea of nolo contendere to, or finding of guilty of, a violation of said subsection, \nbe referred for participation in a drug education program at such person's own expense. \n\n6 \n \nhis marijuana use, Applicant responded, \u201cI\u2019ve tried it. I went to a few parties, tried it, and \nthat was it.\u201d When asked for the number of times that he had used it, Applicant stated that \nhe used it twice between 2008 and 2014 at a party. (Tr. 51-54.) About the glaring \ndiscrepancy between his present account of two-time marijuana use and the adopted \nreport of interview (GE 2) containing his admission to using marijuana once every three \nweeks, Applicant again asserted that it was a miscommunication between him and the \ninvestigator. (Tr. 55.) Applicant stated that he last associated with persons that use \nmarijuana \u201cabout a year ago.\u201d He denied any intention of using marijuana in the future. \nApplicant apparently passed a drug screen by hair analysis in 2017 for the job offer with \nthe defense contractor. (Tr. 56-58.) \n \n \nAbout his possession of drug paraphernalia in January 2016, Applicant testified that \nthe police officer found the drug paraphernalia in the right cup holder between the driver\u2019s \nand passenger\u2019s seats. Despite its obvious location, Applicant asserts he did not notice it in \nhis vehicle. Applicant\u2019s explanation was that it must have been placed there by a friend \nwho had been in his car previously. He testified that he made no inquiries of his friends to \ndetermine to whom it may have belonged because he did not want to argue \u201cover a group \nof friends.\u201d He also stated that only two people could have left the paraphernalia in his \nvehicle, and he told neither of them about it. Applicant indicated that the friends had been \nin his vehicle probably a week before the incident. (Tr. 59-64.) \n \n \nRegarding the August 2016 citation for possession of marijuana, Applicant could not \nexplain what prompted the officer to search his vehicle. When asked whether the officer \nsmelled marijuana or suspected that he was using it, Applicant answered, \u201cNot to my \nknowledge, no. They didn\u2019t say that.\u201d  About where the officer found the marijuana, he \nresponded, \u201cI believe it was on me, in my pocket.\u201d He saw the marijuana on his passenger \nseat, and when he got pulled over, he just put it in his pocket. He recalled that he had his \nfriends in his car the day before he was pulled over by the police. He again did not confront \nthose friends about the marijuana because he is \u201cnot a confrontational person.\u201d (Tr. 65-71.) \nAs to why he continued to associate with known marijuana users after his daughter was \nborn and after he completed his SF 86, Applicant indicated that it took him some time to \nrealize that his friends were not there for him as he was for them. He would have done \nanything for his friends, no matter what. (Tr. 72-73.) \n \n \nConcerning his arrest for evading responsibility, Applicant admits that he had \ntweeted things he should not have said to his girlfriend. He called her names and hit her \ncar, but she did try to cause a fight. He denies that he caused any damage to her vehicle. \n(Tr. 74-76.)  \n \n \nApplicant had been employed as a painter for about a month as of his hearing. He \nenjoys the work, but it is \u201ciffy\u201d with the hours. (Tr. 50-51.) He is struggling to pay his bills. \n(Tr. 84.) He expressed regret for everything that he had done in the past. (Tr. 84.) \n\n7 \n \nCharacter References \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s girlfriend testified that he has become more responsible over the three \nyears of their relationship. She has seen \u201ca lot of improvement in his behavior\u201d over the \npast year. Over time, he changed his friends and become \u201ca way better father.\u201d She has \ncustody of their daughter, but Applicant keeps their daughter overnight for her so that she \ncan work. She told Applicant that she would not allow their daughter to be around his \nfriends who were a negative influence on him. She and Applicant are currently working on \ntheir relationship and spend weekends together. Regarding the 2017 incident, they were \nnot seeing each other at that time (had broken off their relationship) and were being \u201cvery, \nvery mean to each other.\u201d She was angry after arguing with him earlier in the day, and she \nblocked his car. He tried to avoid the situation and hit her vehicle. Because he left the \nscene, she called the police. (Tr. 20-26.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father has almost 30 years of employment with a clearance with the \ndefense contractor that is sponsoring Applicant\u2019s application for a security clearance. \nApplicant\u2019s father testified that there were some trying times when Applicant\u2019s girlfriend \nwas pregnant in that Applicant was \u201ckind of flop-flopping around.\u201d (Tr. 30.) Applicant has \nbecome more responsible. Regarding his son\u2019s arrest for evading responsibility, Applicant\u2019s \nfather testified that it was wrong for Applicant to leave the scene, but he understands that \nApplicant was trying to get away for his safety. He described Applicant as more of a \nfollower than a leader. (Tr. 28-35.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s aunt, who has been a nurse in the mental health and substance abuse \nfield for ten years, attested to Applicant\u2019s desire to work for the defense contractor. She is \naware that, \u201ca few years back [Applicant] was hanging around with the wrong kids trying to \nfind his way in life.\u201d She was surprised to learn that Applicant \u201ctried marijuana, got ticketed, \nand his girlfriend had him arrested for hitting her car when she completely blocked him in.\u201d \nHowever, Applicant realized that he had much to lose if he continued down that path, and \nhe changed his friends. She has noticed a maturity in Applicant since the incident involving \nhis girlfriend and does not consider him to be a threat to national security. (AE A.) \n \n \nThe mother of Applicant\u2019s girlfriend testified that Applicant had her daughter did not \nhave a good relationship in the beginning, but that Applicant has come to be \u201ca great dad \nand a good boyfriend.\u201d She blames her daughter for the 2017 incident that led to \nApplicant\u2019s arrest. Regarding Applicant\u2019s drug charges, she had heard there was one \narrest, but she found it hard to believe of him. She never saw Applicant using illegal drugs, \nbut when she first met him, he associated with \u201cknown potheads.\u201d  She has not seen any of \nthose individuals in over a year. (Tr. 38-41.) \n \n \nThe grandmother of Applicant\u2019s girlfriend has known Applicant for the past three \nyears and sees him when he visits his daughter and girlfriend, who live on the floor above \nher. (AE B; Tr. 41.) Applicant immediately took parental responsibility without any \nresentment and has been \u201can excellent and loving father.\u201d To her knowledge, Applicant has \na good work ethic. She has not seen him smoke marijuana and asks that he be given the \nchance to move forward by obtaining the job with a defense contractor, which would \n\n8 \n \neventually provide him the income needed to marry his girlfriend and support a family. (AE \nB.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n\n9 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concerns about drug involvement and substance misuse are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above. \n  \nAlthough Applicant now claims that he used marijuana only two times, he told an \nOPM investigator that he used marijuana every three weeks with friends from 2008 to \n2014. He had an opportunity to correct the report of interview containing that account of his \ndrug use, and he adopted the summary as accurate with an update that he was going to \ncounseling. Applicant now asserts that there must have been a miscommunication \nbetween him and the interviewer, but he did not elaborate about what he could have said \nthat would explain such a significant discrepancy. Both Applicant\u2019s girlfriend and her \nmother testified that Applicant\u2019s friends at the time were involved with marijuana. His \ngirlfriend\u2019s mother described the friends as \u201cknown potheads.\u2019 Applicant\u2019s account of \nhaving used marijuana approximately three times a week with his friends to fit in is more \ncredible than that he used marijuana only twice. AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany substance misuse,\u201d \napplies. \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant ever purchased any marijuana. However, he \nhad physical possession of marijuana when he took puffs from joints passed to him by his \nfriends. Moreover, he had drug paraphernalia in his vehicle when he was stopped for a \nheadlight violation in January 2016, and he had a bag of marijuana in his possession when \nhe was pulled over for a seatbelt violation in August 2016. AG \u00b6 25(c), \u201cillegal possession \nof a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or \ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia,\u201d is also established.  \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) provides for mitigation when the drug involvement and substance misuse \n\u201chappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant denies any marijuana use since 2014. There \nare no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when conduct is recent for purposes of mitigation. \nThe determination must be based \u201con a careful evaluation of the totality of the record within \nthe parameters set by the directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, \n\n10 \n \n2004). If the evidence shows \u201ca significant period of time has passed without any evidence \nof misconduct,\u201d then an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time \ndemonstrates \u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform \nor rehabilitation.\u201d6  It is difficult to believe that neither the drug paraphernalia that was in the \ncup holder in January 2016 nor the marijuana that was on the passenger seat of his vehicle \nin August 2016 belonged to him. Even assuming that Applicant last used marijuana in \n2014, it cannot be viewed in isolation from the more recent drug paraphernalia and \nmarijuana possession infractions. AG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) provides for mitigation when an individual acknowledges his or her drug \ninvolvement and has no intention of future drug activity: \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) has some applicability in that he stopped associating with his drug-using \nfriends in approximately March 2017, and he intends no future illegal drug involvement. His \ngirlfriend and her mother testified that he has become a more responsible parent to his \ndaughter over the last year. That behavior is consistent with a drug-free lifestyle. Yet, AG \u00b6 \n26(b) requires a truthful acknowledgement of drug involvement. Applicant showed little \nreform in that regard by now maintaining that he used marijuana only twice between 2008 \nand 2014. His recantation of his previous admission to having used marijuana three times \na month raises doubt about whether he has been fully forthright with the Government about \nhis marijuana use, especially where he had marijuana in his possession in August 2016. \nHis serious minimization of his marijuana use at his hearing also makes it difficult to accept \nhis denials that the marijuana and drug paraphernalia in his vehicle in 2016 did not belong \nto him. Under the circumstances, he has not established a sufficient pattern of abstinence \nto safely conclude that his drug involvement is not likely to recur. \n \n \nAlthough Applicant has had some court-ordered substance abuse counseling, he \ntestified that it was for alcohol. He did not present evidence of a favorable prognosis that is \nrequired under AG \u00b6 26(d), which provides: \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including, \nbut not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without \n                                                 \n6 See ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). \n\n11 \n \nrecurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical \nprofessional. \n \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern about criminal conduct is articulated in AG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nUnder state law, Applicant\u2019s possession of drug paraphernalia in January 2016 and \npossession of marijuana in August 2016 are infractions. Use of a small quantity of \nmarijuana is punishable only by a fine. While the state may have decriminalized the use \nand possession of less than a half-ounce, it is still against the law. Furthermore, marijuana \nis a Schedule I controlled drug under federal law pursuant to Title 21, Section 812(c) of the \nUnited States Code, and use of marijuana is illegal. The evidence shows that Applicant \nwas granted accelerated rehabilitation in June or July 2017 for misdemeanor evading \nresponsibility. He left the scene after he struck his girlfriend\u2019s vehicle in February 2017. \nTwo disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31 apply because of his illegal drug involvement \nand misdemeanor evading responsibility: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be unlikely \nto affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in combination cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness; and \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an admission, \nand matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nindividual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n \n \nThe aforesaid illegal conduct is too recent for mitigation under AG \u00b6 32(a), which \nprovides:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32(d) warrants some consideration because Applicant attended five sessions \nof a men\u2019s anger management group and had EAP substance abuse counseling required \nof his accelerated rehabilitation for the 2017 evading responsibility offense. AG \u00b6 32(d) \nprovides: \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to, \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \n\n12 \n \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement. \n \n \nApplicant did not avail himself of the opportunity to provide court documents \nshowing that he had fully satisfied the conditions of his accelerated rehabilitation. The \nprogram coordinator for the anger management program indicates that Applicant attended \nfive sessions of a nine-session program. The EAP counselor provided an update on April \n5, 2018, which shows that Applicant returned to counseling in late March 2018 after no \nsessions since October 5, 2017. There is no clear indication that his participation in the \nanger management program and EAP counseling fully satisfied the requirement of his \naccelerated rehabilitation. If he sufficiently satisfied the requirements for the charge to be \ndismissed in July 2018, it would not fully mitigate the security concerns raised by relatively \nrecent criminal behavior. \n \nWhole-Person Concept  \n  \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d).7 In making the overall commonsense determination required under AG \u00b6 2(c), \nApplicant was only 20 years old when his daughter was born. Youth and immaturity were \ncertainly factors in his continued association with his marijuana-using friends after her birth \nand in Applicant\u2019s illegal possession of drug paraphernalia and marijuana in 2016. He \npossessed marijuana as recently as August 2016, after he completed his SF 86. \n \nThe persons who know Applicant best attested credibly that he has become a good \nfather to his daughter over the past year. However, Applicant has not fully persuaded me \nthat he can be counted on to exercise sound judgment required of a security clearance \nholder. He has shown himself willing to misrepresent his drug involvement to obtain the \nclearance needed for employment to support his daughter. It is well settled that once a \nconcern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong \npresumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, \n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). The Government must be able to rely on those \npersons granted security clearance eligibility to fulfill their responsibilities consistent with \nlaws, regulations, and policies, and without regard to their personal interests. For the \nreasons discussed, Applicant has raised enough doubt in that regard to where I am unable \nto conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant his eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. \n                                                 \n7 The factors under AG \u00b6 2(d) are as follows:  \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n\n13 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n_____________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017. On \nDecember 29, 2017, she addressed all allegations and requested a hearing before a \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge. I was assigned \nthe case on June 12, 2018.  \n \nA notice of hearing was issued on June 19, 2018, setting the hearing for August \n24, 2018. The hearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered five \nexhibits (Exs.), marked and admitted without objection as Exs. 1-5. Applicant gave \ntestimony and offered five documents, which were admitted into the record without \nobjection as Exs. A-E. The transcript (Tr.) was received on August 31, 2018. On \nSeptember 14, 2018, Applicant offered one additional document, which was accepted \n\n \n \n \n \n2 \nwithout objection as Ex. F. The record was then closed. Based on the testimony, \nexhibits, and record as a whole, I find Applicant mitigated security concerns. \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nA 34-year-old staff assistant who has worked in the same capacity since autumn \n2017, Applicant has worked for the same government agency for nearly 16 years \nwithout adverse incident. She has completed some college-level courses. Applicant had \ncancer surgery last year, shortly before the hearing, which hindered her progress in this \nprocess and in generating income for the time being. She subsequently took a weekend \npart-time job to supplement her income in order to help expedite the satisfaction of the \ndebts at issue, and she has updated her budget accordingly. (Tr. 78) She has not yet \nreceived financial counseling.  \n \nApplicant has two minor children and was in a relationship until 2012, when the \npressures of parenthood and the influence of an unsavory crowd ended their \nrelationship and landed her partner in prison. (Tr. 19) Now reformed, the former partner \nis part of the children\u2019s lives, but offers scant financial assistance to Applicant (\u201cHe will \npay for the things he would like to pay for like sports and stuff. . . .\u201d Tr. 21). The eldest \nchild\u2019s father is supposed to pay $393 a month plus $50 toward an arrearage. (Tr. 20-\n23) As of January 2017, his payments have been mostly on time and regular. (Tr. 23)  \n \nApplicant earns approximately $77,000 a year in salary. About two years ago, \nshe began downsizing and economizing by finding a more economical living \narrangement. Her present apartment rent, which includes utilities, is less expensive than \nher previous apartment, but still represents her largest monthly obligation ($1,620), plus \ncable and wi-fi ($210) for her children. (Tr. 24-25) She does not have a cell phone. She \nhas a monthly car payment plus car insurance debt (approximately $685) for the vehicle \nshe bought used. Childcare averages about $250 a month. \n \nAt issue in the SOR are 12 delinquent debts (1.a-1.l) representing approximately \n$23,815. Applicant was not previously aware of some of these debts, but had already \nmade initial efforts to address others before the SOR was issued. She denied the debts \nnoted at 1.d (collection account $770; Date of Last Activity (DLA) 09/12) and 1.g \n(charged-off account for $3,254; DLA 01/12). (Ex. 3 (Equifax) and Ex. 4 (Full Data \nReport/Three-In-One), respectively). Applicant disputed the former account as an \nunknown account and the matter was investigated. (Tr. 30-31) The same is true of the \nlatter account. They are no longer on her Credit Karma/Three-In-One credit report dated \n09/18. (Ex. F)  \n \nThe Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) states that most negative items must be \nremoved from an individual\u2019s credit report seven years from the date of first \ndelinquency. (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681 et seq)  Functionally, a reporting agency is given up to \nseven years plus 180 days to remove a collection account. (see, e.g., Credit Karma web \nsite) As the dates of last activity plus seven years for the debts at 1.d and 1.g would be \nin the year 2019, and Applicant provided a comprehensive, Three-In-One\u2013style credit \n\n \n \n \n \n3 \nreport from mid-2018 in which neither account was still noted after dispute, it may be \nconcluded that they were dropped due to successful dispute, not age.    \n \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant provided documentation showing she has \npaid the debt at 1.c ($335). She provided a logical explanation as to how a salary \novercharge was represented on her credit report for 1.e ($105), and provided \ndocumentary evidence of payment. (SOR Response; Tr. 35-38, 63)  \n \nWith regard to 1.a ($9,827), Applicant thought she had negotiated an even trade-\nin or repossession with a \u201clemon car\u201d with which she acquired a different used vehicle \nfrom what she thought was a sympathetic dealer. (Tr. 43-49) She attached to her SOR \na document showing the debt was amicably put into payroll garnishment, with monthly \npayments of $701 being made to the creditor. (Tr. 72-74; SOR Response; Ex. E)  \n \nThe debt at SOR allegation 1.f ($5,433) also concerns a vehicle. This car had a \ncharged-off balance. Once reliable, the vehicle ended up suddenly needing extensive \nrepairs in 2010, including complete system rewiring and a new fuel pump. Given the \nused car\u2019s age, it was not feasible to make all the necessary repairs. She turned the car \nover to the dealer and was awaiting a bill for any balance owed. She did not know she \nowed a balance on the vehicle until she received the 2017 SOR. In the intervening \nseven years, she \u201cexpected that if they were going to give [her] a bill that [she] would \nhave received it.\u201d (Tr. 52) With no bill for a balance ever received, she assumed she \nowed nothing on the vehicle after auction. Her next step is to reopen communication \nwith this lender to see what else can be done to address this past-due judgment.     \n \nFor allegation 1.b ($3,050), the debt concerns a rental apartment complex in \nwhich Applicant lived from April 2012 until about November 2012. (Tr. 56) The \napartment had many problems, including black mold, and the management office had a \nhigh turnover, frustrating any efforts on follow-through with regard to the myriad of \nproblems. Further, general communication was poor and problems went unaddressed. \n(Ex. D) No documentation shows that a settlement or compromise was reached in terms \nof this specific debt. Applicant plans to revisit this issue next. This debt dropped to the \nbottom of Applicant\u2019s list because of the difficulties approaching the managers. \n \nRemaining are parking tickets or moving violation tickets from the same \njurisdiction near where Applicant lives, noted at allegations 1.h-1.i and reflecting \napproximately $1,000 in delinquent debt. (Tr. 65) They were acquired by either \nApplicant or her former partner. Applicant has researched these tickets and \nacknowledges the debts at 1.h and i.1, which she believes were satisfied through a \nforgiveness-amnesty program a few years ago, but has no documentary evidence to \nshow what, if any, action has been taken on the others. (Tr. 68-70) \n \n \nGoing forward, Applicant is addressing her remaining debts employing a \n\u201csnowball effect.\u201d (Tr. 76) She has started with the smaller debts and is working her way \nup to the larger balances owed, with the intent of then breaking the larger balances \ndown through monthly recurring payments. She plans to find paperwork to show two of \n\n \n \n \n \n4 \nthe tickets were resolved through an amnesty program, then have her former partner \npay the smaller tickets which, more than likely, he incurred. (Tr. 77)  \n \n \nOther than the part-time job and the less expensive apartment she now inhabits \nApplicant has adjusted her work hours to minimize her need of daycare. She now cuts \nher own hair and does her own nails, and has minimized cosmetic and social needs. \nShe is more mindful of money spent on the children. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions \nnecessarily include consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the \nnational interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5 \nAnalysis \n \nUnder Guideline F, AG \u00b6 18 sets forth that the security concern under this \nguideline is that failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.  \n \nHere, the Government offered documentary evidence reflecting that Applicant \nhad numerous delinquent debts and an adverse judgment. This is sufficient to invoke \nfinancial considerations disqualifying conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the inability to do \nso; and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nThree conditions could mitigate the finance related security concerns posed here:  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances, and \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances have been adversely affected over the years by unreliable \npartners, neither of whom maintains any influence over Applicant\u2019s finances. She has \nalso been adversely affected by her fight with cancer. In response to both types of \nproblems, Applicant has persevered, attempted to compensate financially in other areas \n(i.e., finding less expensive housing and economizing), and taking a second job. \nAlthough passively imposed, her largest debt is in repayment through garnishment \n(1.a). The sum at issue is a reasonable sum she can manage to have deducted. The \ndebts at 1.c and 1.e have been addressed, while the debts at 1.d and 1.g were \nsuccessfully disputed and deleted in under seven years since their dates of last activity.  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6 \nApplicant and her former partner are in the process of dividing up the parking and \nmoving violation tickets equitably (1.h-l). Left unaddressed as of today are the debts at \n1.b (apartment balance) and 1.f (automotive balance). On those, past attempts to work \nwith her creditors proved frustrating and unsuccessful. However, she intends to \nreinitiate communications with both creditors in order to see what can be done to satisfy \nthese debts, rather than simply have them fall off her credit report due to age. \nMeanwhile, she is living within her means and, in improving relations with the father of \nher eldest child, she has stabilized child support income from one source. Her second \njob helps supplement her income. Based on the foregoing, I find AG \u00b6 20(a), AG \u00b6 \n20(b), and AG \u00b6 20(d) apply.    \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of her  conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Here, I have considered those factors. I \nam also mindful that, under AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based on \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.   \n      \nApplicant is a 34-year-old staff assistant who has served in the same \ngovernmental agency for over 15 years without adverse incident. She has attended \nsome college. Despite unreliable child support payment histories from the father of both \nher minor children, she has maintained her household solely through her own efforts. \nShe has made genuine strides to live within her means and to honor her known debts, \nto include obtaining a part-time weekend job shortly after cancer surgery in order to \naddress debts she discovered on her SOR for the first time.  \n \nIn sum, Applicant showed that the delinquent debts noted in the SOR at 1.a, 1c-\n1.e, and 1.g have been addressed. She concedes she and her former partner need to \nbe more diligent in dividing responsibility for, and making payments on, the tickets noted \nat 1.h-1l. Meanwhile, she plans to reinitiate efforts to find a way to address the debts at \n1.b and 1.f if the creditors will now work with her.  \n \nThis process does not demand that an applicant satisfy all delinquent debts at \nissue. It does, however, expect an applicant to have devised a workable, reasonable \nplan to address one\u2019s delinquent obligations, and to provide documentation showing \nsuch a plan has been successfully implemented. Applicant has met this standard, and \nalso articulated her plan going forward to address the remainder of her obligations. \nOtherwise, she is living within her means without notable deprivation or difficulty, \nmaintains a workable budget, and is credibly motivated to address all these accounts \nadequately. Given these facts, I conclude Applicant has met her burden and mitigated \nsecurity concerns.  \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7 \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.l: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

Eligibility for access \nto classified information is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 8, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline B, foreign \ninfluence. Applicant responded to the SOR on February 1, 2018, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to another \nadministrative judge on April 18, 2018, and reassigned to me on October 16, 2018. The \nhearing was convened as scheduled on October 31, 2018.  \nEvidence \nGovernment Exhibit (GE) 1 was admitted in evidence without objection.

Without objection, I have taken administrative notice of the facts contained in \nthe request. The facts are summarized in the written request and will not be repeated \nverbatim in this decision. Of particular note is the significant threat of terrorism and \nongoing human rights problems in Iraq. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old potential employee of a defense contractor. He will be \nhired if he receives a security clearance. He has a General Educational Development \n(GED) high school equivalency diploma, which he received in 2017. He is married for \nthe second time. He and his wife have two young children.1 \n \n \nApplicant was born in Iraq to Iraqi parents. He attended high school in Iraq. His \nbrother worked for a humanitarian organization that was affiliated with the United \nStates. Because of his work with the organization, his brother was eligible to immigrate \nwith his family to the United States. Applicant, his mother, and his three siblings \nimmigrated to the United States in 1997. Applicant\u2019s father, who was apparently \ndivorced from Applicant\u2019s mother and remarried, remained in Iraq. Applicant became a \nU.S. citizen in 2009. His mother and siblings live in the United States as U.S. citizens or \npermanent residents.2 \n \n \nApplicant worked under dangerous conditions as a linguist with the U.S. military \nin Iraq from 2005 to 2011, at which time he returned to the United States. His wife is an \nIraqi citizen. He went to Iraq later in 2011 and married his wife. His two children were \nborn in Iraq. His application for his wife to immigrate to the United States was approved. \nApplicant, his wife, and their two children moved to the United States in 2016. His \nchildren are U.S. citizens, and his wife is a U.S. permanent resident who plans to apply \nfor U.S. citizenship as soon as she is eligible.3    \n \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law is deceased. His wife\u2019s mother and siblings are citizens \nand residents of Iraq. His mother-in-law has never worked outside the home. Neither \nApplicant nor his wife have returned to Iraq since 2016. He sent his mother-in-law about \n$1,000 in 2016 for a medical procedure, but he has not provided any additional financial \nsupport to his in-laws. He does not have regular contact with his in-laws in Iraq. To his \nknowledge, none of his in-laws have any direct connection to the Iraqi government or \nany terrorist organization.4 \n \n \nApplicant owns a house in the United States. He has no foreign assets. His \nchildren are in school, and he would like to further his own education. His wife started \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 20, 25, 31-34; GE 1; AE B, C, I. \n \n2 Tr. at 16-17, 30; GE 1; AE B, H. \n \n3 Tr. at 18-33; GE 1; AE B-D. \n \n4 Tr. at 27, 39-43; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nworking a few weeks before his hearing. He credibly testified that his wife and her family \nin Iraq could not be used to coerce or intimidate him into revealing classified \ninformation.5 \n \nApplicant submitted documents and letters from members of the U.S. military \nattesting to his outstanding service as a linguist. He is praised for his dedication, \nprofessionalism, honesty, reliability, work ethic, loyalty to the United States, courage, \nand integrity. A senior U.S. military officer wrote in 2009 that Applicant had been a \nfearless partner in their sometimes dangerous missions, and the officer trusted \nApplicant completely.6 \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n                                                          \n5 Tr. at 26-28, 35-38, 46-47; AE B, K. \n \n6 AE A, D, E. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n\n \n5 \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife is an Iraqi citizen, and his mother-in-law is a citizen and resident \nof Iraq. The potential for terrorist violence against U.S. interests and citizens remains \nhigh in Iraq, and it continues to have human rights problems. Applicant\u2019s foreign \ncontacts create a potential conflict of interest and a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion. The above disqualifying \nconditions have been raised by the evidence.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable:  \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Iraq. Guideline B is not limited to \ncountries hostile to the United States. The United States has a compelling interest in \nprotecting and safeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or \ncountry that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, \norganization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United States.7  \n \n \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made \nwith caution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and \nunexpectedly. Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the \nUnited States, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. The nature of \na nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights \nrecord are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is known to \n                                                          \n7 ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n\n \n6 \n \nconduct intelligence operations against the United States, or the foreign country is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \n \nApplicant is a loyal U.S. citizen who has worked overseas under dangerous \nconditions in support of the national defense. He credibly testified that his wife\u2019s family \nin Iraq could not be used to coerce or intimidate him into revealing classified \ninformation. The Appeal Board has stated that such a statement, standing alone, is of \nlimited value, unless there is record evidence that the applicant has acted in a similar \nmanner in the past in comparable circumstances, or that the applicant has a previous \ntrack record of complying with security regulations and procedures in the context of \ndangerous, high-risk circumstances in which he made a significant contribution to the \nnational security.8 In ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2006), the \nAppeal Board discussed this issue as follows: \n \nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s prior \nhistory of complying with security procedures and regulations significant \nprobative value for the purposes of refuting, mitigating, or extenuating the \nsecurity concerns raised by that applicant\u2019s more immediate disqualifying \nconduct or circumstances. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-03357 at 4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-10113 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, \n2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 30, 2006). \nHowever, the Board has recognized an exception to that general rule in \nGuideline B cases, where the applicant has established by credible, \nindependent evidence that his compliance with security procedures and \nregulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances \nin which the applicant had made a significant contribution to the national \nsecurity. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. July 14, \n2006). The presence of such circumstances can give credibility to an \napplicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to recognize, resist, and \nreport a foreign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or exploitation.  \nApplicant worked under dangerous conditions as a linguist with the U.S. military \nin Iraq from 2005 to 2011. He was heavily praised by senior members of the U.S. \nmilitary. I find that Applicant can be expected to resolve any potential conflict of interest \nin favor of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(a) is applicable to his wife who is a U.S. permanent \nresident waiting to apply for U.S. citizenship. AG \u00b6 8(b) is applicable to all of Applicant\u2019s \nforeign relatives.  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n                                                          \n8 ISCR Case 07-06030 at 3-4 (App. Bd. June 19, 2008). \n\n \n7 \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s work with the U.S. military in Iraq earned him high praise from senior \nU.S. military personnel. The Appeal Board has held that \u201can applicant\u2019s proven record of \naction in defense of the United States is very important and can lead to a favorable \nresult for an applicant in a Guideline B case.\u201d9 The complicated state of affairs in Iraq \nplaces a significant burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his foreign \nfamily members do not pose an unacceptable security risk. He has met that burden.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the foreign influence security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

He also falsified his responses to two questions on his April 2016 security \nclearance application (SCA). Based upon all of the record evidence, Applicant failed to \nsatisfy his burden of persuasion to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline B, and \nthe Government\u2019s evidence was sufficient to establish unmitigated security concerns \nunder Guideline E that Applicant falsified his responses on his SCA. National security \neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 14, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guidelines B and E. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended \n(Exec. Or.); DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \n\n \n2 \n \nguidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016), for all adjudicative decisions on or after \nJune 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (SOR Response) on April 14, 2018. He requested \na hearing before an administrative judge at the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). The case was originally assigned to another judge and then was reassigned to \nme on October 17, 2018. On the same day, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling \nthe hearing on November 14, 2018, via video teleconference. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. It was determined at the outset that Applicant could not hear what was being \nsaid at the other end of the video teleconference. Applicant advised that he did not have \nhis hearing aids with him. The Department Counsel moved for a continuance so that the \nproceeding could be conducted at a later date when Applicant was equipped with his \nhearing aids and could participate fully in the hearing. For good cause shown, I granted \nthe continuance. It was noted that it would be desirable for the case to be presented in \nperson to ensure that Applicant fully understood everything that was being said. \n \n \nAfter the hearing was adjourned, Applicant stated that if it would expedite the \nscheduling of the hearing, he would be willing to travel a couple of hours to a location \nwhere DOHA routinely conducts in-person hearings. In due course, the case was again \nassigned to me, and DOHA sent Applicant a notice of hearing scheduling the case for \nMarch 12, 2019. I convened the hearing in person as scheduled. Applicant again came \nto the hearing without his hearing aids. We arranged his seating and Department \nCounsel\u2019s so as to make my comments and those of Department Counsel as clear and \naudible as possible for Applicant. He agreed with my instruction that he should interrupt \nthe proceeding if he could not hear or understand what was being said. (Tr. 6-7.)  \n \nDepartment Counsel offered three documents into evidence, which were pre-\nmarked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-3. These exhibits were admitted into evidence \nwithout objection. She also offered the Government\u2019s request for administrative notice \nregarding the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (Afghanistan) as Administrative Notice I. \nApplicant had no objection to Department Counsel\u2019s request, but he asked for the \nopportunity to present a written statement on the country conditions in Afghanistan. I \nagreed that he could make such a submission, and I gave him a deadline of March 29, \n2019. Applicant testified and offered five exhibits, which I marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits \n(AE) A through E. Department Counsel had no objection to Applicant\u2019s exhibits, and I \nadmitted the evidence into the record.  \n \nAfter Department Counsel made her closing argument, Applicant requested that \nhe be allowed to provide his closing statement in writing after he had an opportunity to \nreview the transcript of the hearing. I encouraged him to do so out of concern that his \nhearing impairment might have caused him to not hear something that was said during \nthe hearing. I instructed him to submit his closing statement on or before March 29, 2019, \nalong with his written statement about the country conditions in Afghanistan. On March \n20, 2019, he emailed to me three proposed exhibits and his written closing statement. I \nmarked his three exhibits as AE F through H, and I marked his written closing statement \n\n \n3 \n \nas Hearing Exhibit I. I note that AE H is Applicant\u2019s response to Department Counsel\u2019s \nrequest for administrative notice, but it is in fact more of an evidentiary statement \nregarding his personal views of the risks associated with his return to Afghanistan in the \nevent he was granted a security clearance. He also wrote about his obligations to the \nUnited States. I have also marked the email thread regarding this post-hearing \nsubmission as Hearing Exhibit II. Applicant also emailed a list of corrections to the \ntranscript, which I have marked as Hearing Exhibit III. Absent an objection, I admitted AE \nF through H into the record. \n \nDOHA received the transcript of the original hearing on November 29, 2018, and \nthe transcript of the second hearing date (Tr.) on March 27, 2019.  \n \nProcedural Rulings \nAt the hearing, the Government requested I take administrative notice of facts \nrelating to Afghanistan. Department Counsel provided a summary of the facts, \nsupported by U.S. Government documents pertaining to Afghanistan. I take \nadministrative notice of certain facts set forth in the U.S. Government documents. They \nare limited to matters that the U.S. Government believes to be accurate and are not \nsubject to reasonable dispute. These facts are set out below in the Findings of Fact. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted, with some explanations, all of the eight allegations in the SOR \nunder Guideline B, except part of SOR \u00b6 1.c regarding his brother\u2019s current employment \nin Afghanistan. He denied the two falsification allegations under Guideline E. I have \nincorporated his admissions in my findings of facts. Applicant\u2019s personal information in \nmy findings of facts is extracted from GE 1, his April 21, 2016 security clearance \napplication (SCA), unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.  \n \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, the hearing transcript, as \ncorrected by Applicant in Hearing Exhibit III, and the documentary evidence, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 66 years old. He was born and raised in Afghanistan. He earned a \nmedical degree there in 1976. He married his first wife in 1984 in Pakistan. They have \ntwo children, ages 33 and 32. Both children were born in Pakistan, are citizens of the \nUnited States, and reside in this country with their mother, who Applicant divorced in \n2005. His first wife is a naturalized U.S. citizen. In 1991, he had a third child out of \nwedlock. This child was born in the United States. Applicant has limited contact with these \nchildren. Applicant remarried in 2005 to a woman who is an Afghan citizen. They married \nin Afghanistan and have one child, age ten, who was born in Afghanistan, but is a U.S. \ncitizen. Applicant\u2019s youngest child lives with Applicant and his second wife in the United \nStates. His wife has applied for U.S. citizenship and her naturalization interview was \nscheduled for late March 2019. At the time the record closed, the record contained no \nevidence showing that she had obtained U.S. citizenship. (Tr. 32, 36, 88-89.) \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents were Afghan residents and citizens and are deceased. His \nmother-in-law and father-in-law were also Afghan residents and citizens and are \ndeceased. Applicant had six sisters and one brother. His brother is deceased, as are two \nof his sisters. The remaining four sisters are citizens and residents of Afghanistan. Each \nof his sisters married, but three are now widowed. His brother-in-law is an elementary \nschool teacher in a rural village working for the Afghan Ministry of Education, though in \nhis SOR Response, Applicant claimed that his brother-in-law ceased teaching in 2008 \nand now works for a private company. His explanation of the discrepancy was confusing \nand centered on what entity paid the teachers in Afghanistan, not whether he was or was \nnot a teacher. In his SCA, Applicant reported that he has quarterly contact with his four \nsisters, either by telephone or in person. At the hearing, he testified that he speaks with \nthem more frequently now, especially after the recent death of one of their husbands. He \nexplained that because his sisters are uneducated, their conversations are limited to \nfamily issues. (Tr. 48-52, 72-73, 100.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife also has family in Afghanistan. One of her brothers teaches at a \nprivate university in that country. Applicant vaguely suggested that his wife may have \nother siblings or family members there, but that none of them hold significant positions in \nAfghan society. (Tr. 89-90.) \n \n \nIn his SCA, Applicant reported that between 2009 and 2016 he traveled to \nAfghanistan nine times for business reasons, often for extended periods of time, and once \nto visit family members. He has traveled to Afghanistan ten to fifteen times since he \nimmigrated to the United States. He stayed with his family during his visits, except when \nhe was in the country to work, which is discussed below. Applicant, his wife, and his \nyoungest child were last in Afghanistan in December 2018 for the engagement of a \ngrandchild of his deceased brother. (Tr. 32-35, 37, 39.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s deceased brother had four sons. They are all citizens and residents of \nAfghanistan. One is a civil engineer. One works for a not-for-profit organization supported \nby U.S. funds from USAID or a similar funding source. The third son works for a private \ninsurance company, and the fourth is doctor who works as a surgeon. Applicant \ncommunicates by email with one of his nephews. (Tr. 45-46.) \n \n \nThe oldest sister of Applicant is a widow with five children. She lives on her \ndeceased husband\u2019s farm in the village where Applicant grew up. She is a housewife. \nThe next oldest sister is also a widow and a housewife. She has no children. She lives \nwith Applicant\u2019s nephews, the sons of his deceased brother. The third oldest sister is \nmarried and has approximately six children. The fourth sister is also a widow. She has \nfive or six children. (Tr. 41-45.) \n \n \nApplicant has lead a life full of political activism fighting for political and social \njustice in Afghanistan. After graduating from medical school in 1975, he worked for the \nAfghan government as a doctor until he was imprisoned in the 1978 to 1980 period by \nthe Russian-backed Afghan government due to his membership in a political party \nopposed to the Afghan government. In 1980, he was released, and he relocated from \n\n \n5 \n \nAfghanistan to Pakistan because he feared for his life if he stayed in Afghanistan. In \nPakistan, he published an article in a newspaper opposing Islamic extremists in \nAfghanistan. He then became a target there and was in danger of being killed. (GE 2.) \n \n \nIn 1988, he immigrated to the United States from Pakistan on a student visa to \nescape the danger he faced in Pakistan. He was 35 years old. He had a one-year \nscholarship. In 1989, he asked for and was granted political asylum in the United States \nbecause of threats against his life following the assassination of his mentor who co-\nfounded with Applicant a health and social services organization in Pakistan to assist \nAfghan refugees. The colleague was assassinated due to Applicant\u2019s newspaper article. \nAs noted below, his interest in the welfare of the Afghan people continued even after he \nimmigrated to the United States. Applicant\u2019s exhibits all attest to his strong beliefs in social \njustice, non-violence, and the importance of educating young people to be responsible \ncitizens. (GE 3 at 1, GE 2 at 1-2; AE A-H; Tr. 61-67.) \n \n \nIn August 1998, he earned a master\u2019s degree in public administration at a U.S. \nuniversity. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in July 1999, at the age of 46. In the \nSCA, he lists that he resided in Afghanistan from April 2011 to May 2015 and from August \n2008 to October 2010, in other words, for at least 6 of the last 20 years when he held U.S. \ncitizenship. The SCA provides no information regarding his residences prior to December \n2005. (GE 3 at 1.) \n \n \nIn 2007, Applicant worked for a year as a contractor as a subject-matter specialist \nat the U.S. Marine Corps base at Quantico, Virginia. He then worked in Kabul, \nAfghanistan, for a year as a subject matter expert contractor. From October 2010 to March \n2011, he was a part-time language instructor in the United States, while at the same time \nhe was the full-time president of an organization he founded in Afghanistan. He performed \nin that position from August 2009 to April 2016, and worked out of his home in Afghanistan \nand traveled once a week to the organization\u2019s offices in another part of Afghanistan. In \nhis July 2016 background interview, Applicant explained further that from May 2012 to \nMay 2014, he actually worked full-time at the Afghan Ministry of Center for Narcotics in \nKabul and that his work for the other organization was only part-time. He also explained \nthat he was not the president of that organization, just an advisor. Starting in November \n2015, he also worked part-time as a security guard in the United States. (GE 3 at 2-3; Tr. \n58-67.) \n \n \nIn April 2016, Applicant was offered a position with a U.S. defense contractor to \nwork as a linguist, which requires a security clearance. If granted a clearance, he will live \nin Afghanistan and work with the U.S. military. As of the date of the hearing, he was still \nworking as a security guard in this country. He is also the \u201cChief Operational Officer\u201d of \nan organization that addresses issues important to immigrant communities in the United \nStates. (GE 3 at 2-3; Tr. 58-67; AE C.) \n \n \nApplicant explained in his SOR Response that his work in 2012 to 2014 in \nAfghanistan was a contract position on a USAID-sponsored project. He was paid with \nfunds provided by USAID, though his point of contact in the ministry was the Afghan \n\n \n6 \n \nDeputy Minister of Counter Narcotics. Formally, he worked for part of the Ministry of \nFinance of Afghanistan, a government agency, and was assigned to provide technical \nassistance to the Afghan counter-narcotics government agency. Applicant had numerous \nmeetings with the Deputy Minister. (Tr. 53-60.) \n \n \nApplicant also reported that he had contact for one year with the current president \nof Afghanistan before his election in May 2014. Applicant provided advice to the then-\ncandidate on counter-narcotics issues. His actual contact with the future president was \nthrough written reports for the candidate. He testified that he only met the future president \ntwice in meetings with others. In a 2016 security screening interview, he admitted that he \nwas highly involved in an organization that worked closely with the Afghan government \nand that he has worked closely with the current president of Afghanistan. He was offered \na position with the Afghan government and was told to wait until after the election so he \ncould assume the position. He waited one year after the election, but in the end he was \ntold that he was not going to be appointed. In May 2015, he returned to the United States. \nHe has had no contact with the Afghan president since May 2015. (Tr. 53-60; GE 2.) \n \n \nAs noted, Applicant has spent a substantial amount of time living and working in \nAfghanistan during the 2008 to 2015 period. While working in support of U.S. interests, \nhe was also working to help the people of Afghanistan. During his time in Afghanistan, he \nkept a bank account in a local bank to deposit his salary and to pay living expenses. When \nhe left the country in May 2015, he withdrew most of the funds in the account. (GE 2 at \n3, 6-7; 14; Tr. 53-58.) \n \n \nIn the SCA, Applicant answered in the negative a question that asked \u201cHas any \nforeign national in the past seven (7) years offered you a job, asked you to work as a \nconsultant, or consider employment with them?\u201d His answer was incorrect because he \nwas offered a position by a foreign national that he thought would materialize after the \n2014 presidential elections in Afghanistan. He waited for one year after the election, \nbelieving that offer was a real opportunity. In his SOR Response, he responded to the \nallegation by writing that while he was consulting for the Afghan government in the 2012 \nto 2014 period, he was actually working for USAID. This response missed the point of the \nfalsification allegation. His SCA answer failed to disclose an offer to work for the Afghan \ngovernment. When pressed on the issue during his security screening interview, he \noffered the same inconsistent response about the offered position. He repeated that \napproach at the hearing, emphasizing the consulting job he had before the presidential \nelection, not the job offer to work in Afghanistan after the election that he waited for a year \nto begin. His testimony did not clarify his reasoning for his negative response to this \nquestion. The source of the funds to pay his salary in a government job was irrelevant to \nwhether a foreign national offered him a job or asked him to work as a consultant. (Tr. 70-\n71; GE 2 at 4, 7.) \n \n \nA separate question asked \u201cHave you or any member of your immediate family in \nthe past seven (7) years had any contact with a foreign government, its representatives, \nwhether inside or outside the U.S.?\u201d Again he answered \u201cNo,\u201d and in his SOR Response \nhe defended his response as a misunderstanding of the meaning of the word \u201ccontact\u201d in \n\n \n7 \n \nthe question. He replied that in the Afghan culture the word \u201ccontact\u201d has a more personal \nmeaning than a working relationship. He argued that the nature of his relationship with \nthe Afghan government officials he came to know while working there was not personal. \nIn answering this question in the negative, he was applying his understanding of what the \nword \u201ccontact\u201d meant. He made the same point at the hearing, using the phrase \u201cwe \nAfghans\u201d in reference to how he viewed the question. Somewhat inconsistently, he \nadmitted in his SOR Response the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f that he had \u201ccontact\u201d \nwith two senior Afghan government officials, one of which was the president of \nAfghanistan. (Tr. 67-70.) \n \n \nApplicant submitted several exhibits for my consideration. I have reviewed them \ncarefully. They explain in depth his personal philosophy and beliefs. These exhibits \nconfirm my impression of Applicant when he testified that he was a serious, thoughtful \nperson with deep convictions. In the past, those convictions have caused him to be \nincarcerated or threatened, but they have also led him to seek to better the sometimes \noppressive conditions of his fellow Afghans. Those experiences have not changed his \ncommitment to speak out when necessary. He is committed to the best interests of both \nAfghanistan and the United States. However, I found some of his testimony on key points \nto be lacking in candor. He tried hard to provide testimony that would reduce the risk of \nan unfavorable clearance decision. It was clear that it was very important to him to be \ngranted a clearance so he could return to Afghanistan. The security screening \ninterviewers reported that they had the same reaction to some of Applicant\u2019s comments. \n(AE A-H; GE 2; Hearing Exhibit I.) \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nAfghanistan is presently an Islamic Republic with a democratically elected \npresident. The county has had a turbulent political history, including an invasion by the \nSoviet Union in 1979. After an accord was reached in 1989, and the Soviet Union \nwithdrew from Afghanistan, fighting continued among the various ethnic, clan, and \nreligious militias. By the end of 1998, the Taliban rose to power and controlled 90% of \nthe country, imposing aggressive and repressive policies. \n \nIn October 2001, U.S. forces and coalition partners led military operations in the \ncountry, forcing the Taliban out of power by November 2001. The coalition sought to \noust al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, and other terrorists seeking to attack the United \nStates from Afghanistan. The new democratic government took power in 2004 after a \npopular election. \n \nA U.S. State Department Travel Advisory remains in effect for Afghanistan under \nwhich the State Department warns U.S. citizens against travel to Afghanistan because \nof continued instability and threats by terrorist organizations against U.S. citizens. Travel \nto all areas of Afghanistan remains unsafe due to the ongoing risk of kidnapping, \nhostage-taking, suicide bombings, military combat operations, landmines, terrorist and \ninsurgent attacks, banditry, armed rivalry between political and tribal groups, militant \nattacks, direct and indirect fire, and insurgent attacks, including attacks using vehicle-\n\n \n8 \n \nborne or other improvised explosive devices. Attacks may also target official Afghan and \nU.S. governmental convoys and compounds, foreign embassies, military installations, \nand other public areas. \n \nNo province in Afghanistan is immune from violence, and the potential exists \nthroughout the country for hostile acts, either targeted or random, against U.S. and other \nforeign nationals at any time. Extremists associated with various terrorist \nnetworks and members of other armed opposition groups are active throughout the \ncountry and remain violently opposed to the Afghan government and the U.S.-led \nCoalition Forces. These terrorist groups have attacked Afghan, Coalition Forces, and \nU.S. targets with little regard for or with the express intent to cause civilian casualties. \nWidespread human rights abuses are also reported. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe SOR sets forth eight allegations under Guideline B. SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that \nApplicant\u2019s wife is a citizen of Afghanistan and SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that his four sisters are \ncitizens and residents of Afghanistan. SOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that his brother-in-law is a citizen \nand resident of Afghanistan and is employed by the Afghan Ministry of Education. SOR \u00b6 \n1.d alleges that Applicant maintains contact with other family members who are citizens \nand residents of Afghanistan. The four remaining allegations, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e through 1.h, \nunder Guideline B allege Applicant\u2019s contact with the current President of Afghanistan \nand an Afghan government official during the May 2012 to May 2014 period, his offer of \nemployment with the Afghan government as an advisor, and his maintenance of an \nAfghan bank account. \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6, as follows: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual maybe manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \n\n \n10 \n \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \nThe evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 7(e): shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  \n \nApplicant has close connections to his wife, four sisters, brother-in-law, and at least \none son of his deceased brother. They are all citizens of Afghanistan and with the \nexception of his wife, are all residents of that country. Further, there is an articulated \nheightened risk associated with having ties to family members in Afghanistan, due to the \nactivities of terrorist organizations and insurgents operating within its borders. Applicant\u2019s \npast contact and association with and his work for the current President and a deputy \nminister raise Applicant\u2019s visibility in the country, which exposes him and his family there \nto an even greater risk than those without such contacts. He has returned to Afghanistan \nas recently as December 2018 despite the State Department\u2019s travel advisory against \ndoing so, which increases the risk of Applicant being identified as an Afghan cooperating \nwith the Afghan and U.S. governments. The evidence, taken as a whole, is sufficient to \nraise these disqualifying conditions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e) apply to Applicant\u2019s \nrelationships with the foreign contacts and connections alleged in the SOR. I do not find, \nhowever, that the admitted and proven allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h regarding a job \noffer with the Afghan government and Applicant\u2019s small balance in an Afghan bank \naccount establish any of the disqualifying conditions in Guideline B.  \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n\n \n11 \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest;  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n \nAG \u00b6 8(f): the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or \nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and \ncould not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual. \n \n \nApplicant has not presented sufficient evidence to support a conclusion that any \nof the above-mitigating conditions apply. It cannot be concluded that it is unlikely \nApplicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of his \nforeign relatives or the Afghan government and the interests of the United States. He still \nthinks of himself in terms of \u201cwe Afghans.\u201d Applicant has been a U.S. citizen for a number \nof years, but he has spent a significant amount of time in the most recent years in \nAfghanistan continuing his ties there and not developing his ties in the United States. He \npresented insufficient evidence of the nature of his ties and loyalties in the United States. \nFurthermore, the record evidence does not support a conclusion that his contacts and \ncommunications with his foreign relatives are casual and infrequent. He and his wife took \ntheir daughter to Afghanistan to visit relatives as recently as December 2018 while this \nmatter was pending. He also talks on the phone with his sisters regularly. Accordingly, \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c) have not been established. To the extent that Applicant bank \naccount in Afghanistan raises a security concern, AG \u00b6 8(f) applies. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \nThe following disqualifying condition under Guideline E is potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b616 (a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \n\n \n12 \n \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nThe record evidence support the conclusion that Appellant deliberately concealed \ninformation from the U.S. Government in his responses to two questions on the SCA, as \nalleged in the SOR. His attempts to rationalize his SOR responses demonstrate that he \ndeliberately chose to answer the questions as he did rather than just simply provide the \nrequested information. His rationales regarding the funding source of his work and the \nAfghan definition of the word \u201ccontact\u201d do not justify his concealment of his job offer in \nAfghanistan and his close working relationships and history with high Afghan government \nofficials. AG \u00b6 16(a) is established.  \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good\u2013faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. \n \n \nIn his May 2016 security screening interview, Applicant mentioned that he received \na job offer to advise the new Afghan government and that he stayed in Afghanistan for a \nwhole year waiting for the job to begin. Arguably, this disclosure to his interviewers could \nbe viewed as a prompt effort to correct the falsification in his SCA. However, he \nequivocated and ended up telling the story that he was merely waiting for another USAID-\nfunded contractor position. The screeners made it clear in their report that they felt he \nwas being inconsistent and was not fully candid. His testimony at the hearing was also \nlacking in candor and credibility. As a result, the good-faith requirement of this mitigating \ncondition is not present. AG \u00b6 17(a) is not established with respect to SOR \u00b6 2.a. \n \n \nThe same is true with respect to SOR \u00b6 2.b. Appellant discussed his interactions \nwith the future president of Afghanistan during his screening interview, but at the hearing \nhe downplayed the level of the interactions to merely writing papers for the presidential \ncandidate and attending two meetings at which the candidate and future president was in \nattendance. These circumstances do not satisfy the good-faith mitigation requirements of \nAG \u00b6 17(a). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s two falsifications are not minor. They go right to the issue of his \ntrustworthiness on issues that he perceived might damage his chances of being \nadjudicated eligible for a security clearance. It is clear from the hearing that this medically \ntrained doctor who cannot practice his profession in the United States and must work as \na security guard, is willing to muddle his personal history in an effort to be adjudicated as \n\n \n13 \n \nqualified for a position as a linguist in Afghanistan and be able to return to his native \ncountry. The two falsifications cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \njudgment. He has not carried his burden of persuasion to establish AG \u00b6 17(a).  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). The factors are:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines B and E in my whole-person \nanalysis. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under these guidelines \nand evaluating all of the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Appellant \nhas not mitigated the security concerns raised by his foreign contacts and connections \nand his personal conduct.  \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1. Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n14 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all the record evidence, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational security interests of the United States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \nJohn Bayard Glendon \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He did not present sufficient evidence to mitigate his \nuse of marijuana during a five-year period while granted access to classified \ninformation. He also deliberately made false statements on a 2015 security clearance \napplication when he denied using marijuana. Accordingly, this case is decided against \nApplicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF 86 format) on February 24, 2015. (Exhibit 1) This document is commonly \nknown as a security clearance application. Thereafter, on February 6, 2018, after \nreviewing the application and the information gathered during a background \ninvestigation, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort \nMeade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was \nunable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is similar to a complaint. It \n\n \n2 \n \ndetailed the factual reasons for the action under the security guidelines known as \nGuideline H for drug involvement and substance misuse and Guideline E for personal \nconduct.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 21, 2018, with a two-page memorandum. \nHe admitted the SOR allegations under Guideline H with clarifications concerning when \nhis marijuana use ended and the frequency of his marijuana use. He admitted making \nthe false statements alleged under Guideline E. He provided brief explanations for his \nadmissions. And he requested an in-person hearing before an administrative judge.   \n \nThe case was assigned to another administrative judge on May 16, 2018, and \nthen reassigned to me on May 22, 2018. The hearing was conducted as scheduled on \nSeptember 19, 2018. Department Counsel offered documentary exhibits, which were \nadmitted as Government Exhibits 1 and 2. Applicant did not offer any documentary \nexhibits, he called no witnesses, and he relied on his own testimony. The hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) was received on September 26, 2018.    \n \n  Findings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance \nlast granted to him by the Defense Department in 2007. He is employed by a company \nworking in the defense industry as a subject-matter expert in technologies and systems \nbased on Microsoft products. He has been so employed since 2012. His annual salary \nis about $133,000, and he described his employment record as \u201cexcellent.\u201d (Tr. 39) His \neducational background includes an associate\u2019s degree awarded in 2000, and a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in computer information systems awarded in 2007. His employment \nhistory includes honorable military service in the U.S. Coast Guard during 1994-1999. \nHe served as an aviation electronics technician. He was granted a security clearance \nfor the first time in about 1997 while in the Coast Guard.   \n \nApplicant is twice married and divorced. He married the first time in 1994 and \ndivorced in 2003. He married the second time in 2007, separated in June 2014, and \ndivorced in 2015. He shares two minor children with his second wife. His marijuana use, \nwhich began in 2009 and ended in about mid-2014 or so, occurred during his second \nmarriage, as he smoked it with his spouse and another woman. Before that, he had \nnever used marijuana. He indicated that his then spouse introduced marijuana into their \nmarriage. (Tr. 36-37) He estimated the frequency of his marijuana use as four to five \ntimes per year, at the most. (Tr. 38) He understands or believes that his marijuana use \nwas contrary to his employer\u2019s policy. (Tr. 33) \n \nApplicant deliberately omitted his marijuana use during 2009-2014 when he \ncompleted his February 2015 security clearance application. In particular, he did not \ndisclose it in response to two questions. First, he denied the use of any illegal drug or \ncontrolled substance in the last seven years. Second, he denied ever illegally using or \notherwise being involved with a drug or controlled substance while possessing a \nsecurity clearance. At the hearing, he explained that he omitted his marijuana use \nbecause he was concerned his employer would discover it. (Tr. 32) In addition, he failed \n\n \n3 \n \nto disclose his marijuana use when asked about it during a 2017 background \ninvestigation. (Tr. 33; Exhibit 2) He admitted his marijuana use after he was confronted \nwith it during the background investigation. He considered marijuana to be in his past, \nand disclosure might negatively affect his chances of retaining a security clearance. (Tr. \n33)1  \n \nAt present, Applicant has no intention to resume using marijuana or any other \ncontrolled substance or drug. (Tr. 33-34) To that end, in his written answer to the SOR, \nhe stated that he does not intend to illegally use any drugs in the future, and he fully \nunderstands that any future illegal use of any drugs may result in revocation of a \nsecurity clearance.  \n \nLaw and Policies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.2 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d3 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.4 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.5 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.6 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \n                                                          \n1 Because this matter is not alleged in the SOR, I did not consider it for disqualification purposes, but I did \nconsider it in assessing Applicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation.  \n \n2 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n4 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted). \n \n6 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n\n \n4 \n \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.7 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nUnder Guideline H for drug involvement and substance misuse, the concern is \nset forth in AG \u00b6 24 as follows:  \n \n[t]he illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose, can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. . .  \n \n \nIn addition to the above matters, I note that the Director of National Intelligence \n(DNI) issued an October 25, 2014 memorandum concerning adherence to federal laws \nprohibiting marijuana use. In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state \ncan authorize violations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances \nAct, which identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Second, changes to \nstate laws (and the laws of the District of Columbia) concerning marijuana use do not \nalter the national security adjudicative guidelines. And third, a person\u2019s disregard of \nfederal law concerning the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains relevant \nwhen making eligibility decisions for sensitive national security positions.  \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse; \n \nAG \u00b6 25(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position; \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \n                                                          \n7 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E.3.1.15. \n\n \n5 \n \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds of revocation of national security eligibility. \n \n \n \nI have considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s involvement with marijuana, which \nbegan in about 2009 and ended about five years later in about mid-2014 or so. The \nentirety of his marijuana use occurred while he was granted access to classified \ninformation and held a security clearance. Any illegal drug use is relevant in the context \nof evaluating a person\u2019s security worthiness, but it is particularly egregious if it occurs \nwhile granted access to classified information. As a longtime clearance holder, \nApplicant knew such conduct was off limits and forbidden, but engaged in it just the \nsame on an on-again, off-again basis. It was not a mere lapse in judgment or an \nisolated incident, as shown by the frequency of his use (about four times yearly) and the \nduration of his use (over a five-year period). More is expected of Applicant given his \nage, experience, and maturity during 2009-2014. With that said, his last use of \nmarijuana occurred about four years ago, and he was credible in stating that he does \nnot intend to use marijuana in the future. Nevertheless, the seriousness of his \nmisconduct, illegal drug use while holding a security clearance, outweighs his evidence \nin mitigation.  \n \n \nUnder Guideline E, personal conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about a person\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. The concern is stated fully in AG \u00b6 15. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, the following disqualifying condition applies:  \n \nAG \u00b6 16(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national \nsecurity eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \n \nAs set forth in the findings of fact, Applicant made deliberately false statements when he \nomitted his past use of marijuana in a February 2015 security clearance application. He \ndid so out of concern that his employer would discover his illegal drug use. He \nacknowledged his marijuana use after he was confronted with it during the 2017 \nbackground investigation.  \n \n \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17, and none apply in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. Making deliberately false statements during the security clearance \nprocess is serious misconduct, and it is not easily explained away, excused, or \notherwise mitigated. Based on the record before me, Applicant\u2019s misconduct in falsifying \nhis 2015 security clearance application is far too serious to be mitigated.   \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he \nhas not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n  \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n  \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 58 years old, married (since 1982), with three adult children (a daughter age 39, and three sons ages 36, 33, and 24). Applicant is a high school graduate, and since November 2005, she has worked for federal contractors. From November 1983 until December 2004, she also worked for a federal contractor. (GE 1; Tr. 17.) Under Guideline F, the December 6, 2017 SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file federal income tax returns for 2006 through 2010 and 2014 through 2016. The SOR also alleged that Applicant failed to pay federal income taxes for 2009 and 2010, and 2014 through 2016 for an aggregate of $17,553. The SOR also alleged that Applicant failed to file state income taxes for 2014 through 2016. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h.) Applicant denied the allegations and answered that all taxes alleged had been filed and paid. (Answer \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h.)

She presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, \nand mitigate the security concern stemming from her problematic state and federal \nincome tax history. Accordingly, this case is decided for Applicant.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 6, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging that \nher circumstances raised a security concern under Guideline F, financial considerations.1\n1 This action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended, as well as Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). In \naddition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), \neffective within the Defense Department on June 8, 2017, apply here. \n\n2 \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 3, 2018, and requested a hearing to establish \nher eligibility for continued access to classified information. \n \n \n \nI was assigned the case on July 20, 2018. On September 13, 2018, a date mutually \nagreed to by the parties, a hearing was held. Applicant testified at the hearing. The \nGovernment offered three exhibits, which were marked for identification as GE 1 through \n3, and which were admitted without objection. Applicant offered three exhibits (AE), which \nwere marked for identification as AE A through C, and were admitted without objection. \nThe record was left open until September 27, 2018. Applicant timely submitted nine \nadditional exhibits, which were marked for identification as AE D through L and were \nadmitted without objection. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on September \n24, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 58 years old, married (since 1982), with three adult children (a \ndaughter age 39, and three sons ages 36, 33, and 24). Applicant is a high school \ngraduate, and since November 2005, she has worked for federal contractors. From \nNovember 1983 until December 2004, she also worked for a federal contractor. (GE 1; \nTr. 17.) \n \n Under Guideline F, the December 6, 2017 SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file \nfederal income tax returns for 2006 through 2010 and 2014 through 2016. The SOR also \nalleged that Applicant failed to pay federal income taxes for 2009 and 2010, and 2014 \nthrough 2016 for an aggregate of $17,553. The SOR also alleged that Applicant failed to \nfile state income taxes for 2014 through 2016. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h.)  Applicant denied \nthe allegations and answered that all taxes alleged had been filed and paid. (Answer \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a through 1.h.) Applicant also attached to her Answer a narrative, which she elaborated \nupon at the hearing. Also as part of the Answer, Applicant attached Answer Exhibit A \n(Answer Ex. A) (IRS transcripts for tax years 2009 through 2016), Answer Ex. B (IRS \nInstallment Agreement dated June 11, 2017 and bank statements showing payments to \nthe IRS in August through November 2017), and Answer Ex. C (checks showing payment \nof state income taxes for 2014 through 2016). \n \nAt the hearing Applicant testified about how she and her family came to have \nfinancial problems. In 2006, Applicant and her spouse were long-time residents in a \nwestern state (State No. 1), where her four children had been born. Applicant had recently \ntaken a job with a federal contractor in November 2005. She felt that her employment \nposition was secure. Applicant was making about $65,000 per year. Applicant\u2019s spouse \nhad a good paying job as a technical customer service representative for his employer, \nwhich sold security devices to commercial construction contractors. He was making about \n$62,000 per year. (Tr. 17-19, 46-47; GE 1.) \n \nIn early 2006, Applicant had an opportunity to take a somewhat better paying job \nwith her then current employer, but the position was located in the eastern United States \n(State No. 2).  Applicant and her spouse did some research, and the economy in State \n\n3 \n \nNo. 2 looked favorable in the middle of 2006. In addition, her spouse had good contacts \nin State No. 2 through his then current employer. Applicant and her family moved from \nState No. 1 to State No. 2 in the late summer of 2006. They had just moved when the \nbottom started to drop out of the real estate market. It ultimately \u201cdropped severely.\u201d That \ndownturn affected the construction industry all around. As a result, the employment \nopportunities for Applicant\u2019s spouse in State No. 2 that were \u201cabsolutely secure\u201d when \nthey left State No. 1 \u201cquickly became no positions whatsoever.\u201d (Tr. 19-20; GE 1.) \n \nIt took Applicant\u2019s spouse three months to find a job. He finally got a \u201cmuch reduced \nposition\u201d as a customer service representative with a local general contractor. It was a \n\u201cwonderful position, but it didn\u2019t last long.\u201d In February 2007, her spouse lost that job. \nBecause her spouse voluntarily left his job in State No. 1 to accompany Applicant to her \nnew position in State No. 2, he did not qualify for unemployment from State No. 1. \nBecause Applicant\u2019s spouse had worked less than three months in State No. 2, he did \nnot qualify for unemployment from State No. 2. Applicant testified that \u201cinstantly their \nincome dropped by one-half.\u201d They were also shouldering about $12,000 of moving \nexpenses, because her former employer had been overcharged by the moving company \nbut elected not to challenge it. So Applicant was unable to contest those charges. (Tr. 19-\n20, 48.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse was unemployed or underemployed for three years and applied \nfor hundreds of jobs. To try to make ends meet, her spouse twice did part-time work for \na tax preparation firm during tax season. Finally, in about 2013 her spouse found a job \nwith a local business owner. Her spouse took a \u201csignificant pay cut\u201d from what he was \nmaking in State No. 1, but even though her spouse is underemployed in this job, it was \nvery steady employment. His pay fluctuates; it was (and is) between $28,000 and $33,000 \nper year. Her spouse has now been employed in that job for about five years. (Tr. 21-22, \n46.)  \n \nApplicant testified about her financial situation in the 2008 to 2013 timeframe. She \nand her spouse \u201clooked hard\u201d at what they could do to adjust to their much lowered \nstandard of living. She said it was difficult to do much about their finances when one \nmonth her spouse would be employed and the next month unemployed. His \nunemployment benefit was about $235 per week, which would cover only half of their \nrent. The period from 2008 to 2012 was particularly difficult. Applicant struggled to feed \nher youngest son and to keep the utilities on. On a couple of occasions, her utilities were \nterminated. In 2012, she and her spouse enrolled in a local university course in budgeting \nand money management. Because they could not afford the tuition, her daughter, who is \nin finance and accounting, gave it to them as a gift. It was a \u201cpretty intense course\u201d and \nlasted 12 weeks. That course changed their lives for the better. (Tr. 23-25, 86-87.) \n \nBy 2013, when her spouse found a full-time job, Applicant\u2019s financial situation \nbegan to look better. At that time, she was working on staying current with their household \nbills. There was not much, however, Applicant could do to address back debt. As a result, \nshe began looking at other employment positions. Applicant was hired almost \nimmediately, in October 2013, by her current employer. The new position came with a \n\n4 \n \nbetter salary and a hiring bonus. Applicant began, therefore, to focus on paying off \noutstanding consumer debt. She reasoned that outstanding delinquent consumer debt \ncould have resulted in garnishments. By the end of 2013, she had brought all consumer \naccounts current. Applicant accomplished that by using her hiring bonus from her current \nemployer and her severance pay from her last employer. (Tr. 27-31, 78-79.) With one \nexception, the record supports Applicant\u2019s claim that she resolved all her consumer debts. \nAs of February 2016, the credit report shows no past due amounts or collection accounts; \nthat same credit report shows one collection account reduced to a judgment for $658 in \nJune 2011, which was satisfied in January 2015. (GE 2.) Similarly, the credit report of \nSeptember 2018 shows no past due amounts or collection accounts. All open accounts \nare current, and closed accounts report \u201cpaid satisfactorily.\u201d Applicant currently has no \ndelinquent consumer debts. (AE C; Tr. 85, 92.) \n \nBy the end of 2013 or the beginning of 2014, Applicant and her spouse began \nlooking to retain a tax attorney. She and her family had physically moved across the \ncountry. Some tax records had been lost. Applicant had moving expenses, some of which \nwere paid by her then employer; some were not. Her spouse had been unemployed, and \nsome taxes had been paid out of unemployment benefits; some had not. It was a complex \ntax situation. By mid-2014 Applicant had retained a tax attorney. His initial advice was not \nto file anything or pay anything to the IRS, until Applicant could get all documentation \ntogether. At that point, the attorney said they could then approach the IRS with a complete \npackage to determine the sum owed and agree on a monthly payment plan. (Tr. 31-32.) \n \nApplicant testified that matters got further complicated when she was the victim of  \n\u201can identity hack\u201d at the IRS in about 2015 as a result of which her IRS PIN was \ncompromised. Therefore, without a current IRS PIN, Applicant could not make any filings. \nIt took over a year to get a new PIN. At the same time, her tax attorney was working with \nthe IRS to come up with an installment agreement. It was never Applicant\u2019s intent not to \npay taxes owed. Applicant testified that she did not ask her attorney to negotiate a lower \namount than what was due to the IRS. She believed that it was \u201crightfully [hers]\u201d to pay \nthe amount due. (Tr. 32-33, 88-89; AE B.) \n \nAs of December 2016, Applicant\u2019s tax attorney reported that Applicant was \ncompliant for all years, and there were no missing returns, except for 2015. With that \ninformation, Applicant elected to have her attorney prepare the 2016 tax return and then \n\u201cmove forward with a financial based resolution\u201d with the IRS. (AE E.) By the end of 2016 \nand early 2017, Applicant\u2019s attorney had everything he needed to work with the IRS to \nreach an installment agreement (all documents and a new PIN). It took some time. On \nJune 11, 2017, Applicant and her spouse signed an installment agreement with the IRS, \nwhich called for a lump sum payment of $775 and monthly payments thereafter of $695. \n(Tr. 33, 59-60; AE D.) Applicant submitted documentation showing her adherence to that \nagreement. (Answer Ex. B (bank statements showing payments from August 2017 \nthrough December 2017); AE H; AE J (IRS documents showing payments made from \nAugust 2017 through September 2018).) The record shows that Applicant\u2019s federal \nreturns were timely filed for 2011, 2012, and 2013. The record also shows that federal \nreturns for 2009, 2010, and 2014 through 2016 were filed late but under the June 11, \n\n5 \n \n2017 installment agreement and were accepted by the IRS. Federal income taxes were \nfiled late due to Applicant\u2019s financial situation and her spouse\u2019s unemployment. Until \nrecently, Applicant did not realize the difference between filing returns and paying taxes. \nShe now knows that she should have filed her returns even if she did not have the ability \nto pay the taxes due. Applicant\u2019s federal and state returns for 2017 are now being \nprepared by her attorney, who still needs some supporting documents for certain \nbusiness expenses. Applicant was unsure but hoped that her tax attorney filed for an \nextension for 2017. As to other back returns, if she was required to file, her attorney filed \nfor her. For earlier years, if the record does not show a filing, it is because no filing was \nrequired. (Answer Ex. A; Tr. 47-48, 53-62.) \n \nApplicant testified about her failure to file her returns and pay her State No. 2 \nincome taxes for 2014, 2015, and 2016. She explained that she thought that her tax \nattorney would handle those filings as well as federal filings. She was wrong. When \nApplicant pulled her tax records to answer the SOR, she learned that she was late in filing \nand paying state tax returns for those three years. Applicant filed and paid those herself \ndirectly. The record shows that she owed $141 and $163 for years 2015 and 2016, \nrespectively. The record includes Applicant\u2019s personal checks payable to State No. 2 \ndated January 3, 2018, for $197.48 and $218.53, for 2015 and 2016, respectively. The \namount owed for 2014 is blocked by a copy of a check dated January 2, 2018, to State \nNo. 2 for $17.42. (Tr. 63-67; Answer Ex. C.)  \n \nApplicant testified about tuition for her children\u2019s education. She and her spouse \ndid not pay tuition for all their children\u2019s education. Applicant and her spouse contributed \nwhat they could. They could not pay tuition for her oldest son. One son moved back home, \nso he got free room and board. He did, however, pay his tuition and fees. Applicant and \nher spouse needed to pay half of their youngest son\u2019s tuition, so he would qualify for \nfederal loans and grants. That son paid the other half out of loans he took out. He attended \na public university in State No. 2. (Tr. 44-45.) \n \nApplicant testified about her current financial situation. Her spouse\u2019s pay fluctuates \nbetween $28,000 and $33,000 per year. Applicant makes about $155,000 to $160,000 \nper year. She does not see her income deviating any time in the future, although she and \nher spouse intend to buy a house as a tax shelter, now that they can afford that. \nApplicant\u2019s salary and her spouse\u2019s salary are their only sources of income. She does not \nhave a savings account, and her current balance in her checking account is about $3,400.  \nApplicant\u2019s only retirement account is with her first defense contractor. She cannot access \nit before she reaches 62 \u00bd years of age. Applicant\u2019s spouse has no retirement or other \nbenefits. Including her payment to the IRS, Applicant\u2019s monthly expenses are about \n$4,200. She is financially current on all bills. (Tr. 45-46, 81-83, 93.)  \n \nApplicant testified that she recently took out an auto loan for a used car that she \nshares with one of her sons. It is now paid off. Her husband drives an older truck. They \nsold a motorcycle they bought thinking it would provide cheap transportation. They used \nthe sale proceeds to pay down that loan. They have no new vehicles. As for federal and \nstate income taxes, they are taking advantage of their daughter\u2019s expertise as a certified \n\n6 \n \nauditor. Applicant plans to increase paycheck withholdings to set aside taxes during the \nyear and to file returns on time. (Tr. 85-88.) \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). Individuals are eligible for access to classified information \n\u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest\u201d to authorize \nsuch access. E.O. 10865 \u00a7 2; SEAD-4, \u00b6 E.4. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance, an administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions. The \nguidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human \nbehavior, an administrative judge applies the guidelines in a  commonsense manner, \nconsidering all available and reliable information, in arriving at a fair and impartial \ndecision. SEAD-4, Appendix A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(c), 2(d). \n \nDepartment Counsel must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. Applicants are responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and \nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or \nproven . . . and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \nclearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \n \nAdministrative Judges are responsible for ensuring that an applicant receives fair \nnotice of the issues raised, has a reasonable opportunity to litigate those issues, and is \nnot subjected to unfair surprise. ISCR Case No. 12-01266 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 4, 2014). \nIn resolving the ultimate question regarding an applicant\u2019s eligibility, \u201c[a]ny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in \nfavor of the national security.\u201d SEAD-4, Appendix A, \u00b6 2(b). See also SEAD-4, \u00b6 E.4. \nMoreover, the Supreme Court has held that officials making \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain \ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of \ncompromise of classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n7 \n \nDiscussion \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has a number of unfiled and unpaid state and \nfederal income taxes, which purportedly raise a security concern under Guideline F. The \nfinancial considerations security concern is explained at AG \u00b6 18, which in pertinent part, \nstates: \n  \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.  \n \n Guideline F is not limited to a consideration of whether a person with financial \nissues might be tempted to compromise classified information or engage in other illegality \nto pay their debts. It also addresses the extent to which the circumstances giving rise to \ndelinquent debt and other security-significant financial issues cast doubt upon a person\u2019s \nself-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified information. \n(ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May. 1, 2012).)  \n \n \nIn assessing Applicant\u2019s case, I considered the following pertinent disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \n AG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file. . .annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns \nor failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n\n8 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nA security clearance adjudication is not a debt-collection process. Rather, an \nadministrative judge examines the way an applicant handles his or her personal financial \nobligations to assess how they may handle their security obligations. (See generally ISCR \nCase No. ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2016).) Here, Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance eligibility was called into question by her past state and federal income \ntax delinquencies. I conclude that disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), (c), and (f) apply. \nThe next inquiry is whether any mitigating conditions apply.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s tax problems arose from a perfect storm of circumstances. Applicant \nwas employed in a well-paying job in State No. 1. Her husband was also employed in an \nequally well-paying job in that state. In early 2006, Applicant had an opportunity to take a \nsomewhat better-paying job with the same employer but in a different state (State No. 2) \nrequiring a significant geographic move. She and her husband did due diligence. They \nlearned that the economy in State No. 2 looked favorable. Applicant\u2019s spouse, who \nworked in commercial construction and real estate, was confident that he could land a \nnew position either with his current employer or with connections he had made through \nthat employer. So, Applicant, her spouse and their four children moved to State No. 2 in \nthe summer of 2006. So far, so good. (\u201cThe best-laid plans of mice and men [and women] \noften go awry.\u201d Paraphrase of a passage from \u2018To a Mouse\u2019 by Robert Burns.) \nIn late 2006 and early 2007, however, the now historic economic depression \nrocked the country. Although Applicant\u2019s employment did not suffer, her spouse\u2019s real \nestate and construction-dependent job opportunities were affected adversely. As a result, \nhe was unemployed or underemployed for about three years. Applicant\u2019s household \nincome was cut in half. The period from 2008 to 2012 was particularly difficult. Applicant \nand her spouse struggled to make ends meet. She and her spouse took a 12 week \nuniversity course in budgeting and money management that changed their lives. By 2013, \nApplicant\u2019s spouse found a full-time job, albeit at a compensation level about half of what \nhe was making when they left State No. 1. It was (and is), however, steady work.  \nApplicant now was staying current with her household bills, but she was unable to \naddress back delinquencies. As a result, Applicant began looking at better paying \nemployment opportunities. In the fall of 2013, she was hired by her current employer. Her \nnew job was at a higher salary and came with a signing bonus. The improved salary \ncoupled with the signing bonus and severance pay from her last employer allowed \nApplicant to begin to address delinquent accounts. To avoid garnishments, she planned \nto resolve back consumer debts first.  \n\n9 \n \nBy the end of 2013 and the beginning of 2014, Applicant and her spouse had \naddressed their delinquent consumer debt and were staying current on household bills. \nTherefore, they were in a position to address deficiencies in filing their income tax returns \nand paying back income taxes. To that end, they retained an income tax attorney in mid-\n2014.  The first advice Applicant received was to gather all relevant records so the \nattorney could assemble a package to submit to the IRS, so that the amount owed could \nbe calculated. The next step was to approach the IRS to negotiate an installment \nagreement. The tax situation was complex because Applicant and her family had \nphysically moved across the country to pursue a better salary with her then employer. \nMany of her tax records were with her former employer, and her spouse had been \nunemployed or underemployed with part-time jobs, which complicated the tax matter \nfurther. In addition, in about 2015 Applicant was the victim of an IRS \u201cidentity hack,\u201d which \ncompromised her IRS PIN needed to file her income tax returns. It took some time for her \nto get a new PIN.  \nBy the end of 2016 or early 2017, Applicant\u2019s attorney had compiled all of the \ndocuments needed to approach the IRS and negotiate an installment agreement. On \nJune 11, 2017, Applicant and her spouse signed an installment agreement with the IRS \ncalling for an upfront payment of $775 followed by monthly payments of $695. Applicant \ndocumented that she has adhered to that agreement through and including the date of \nthis hearing. In the course of responding to the SOR, Applicant discovered that she had \nunfiled state income tax returns for 2014, 2015, and 2016. Applicant mistakenly believed \nthat her tax attorney had taken care of those returns. When she learned that he had not, \nshe herself filed those returns and paid any taxes due. Only the returns for 2017 remain \nto be filed, and they are being prepared by her tax attorney.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s tax delinquencies and deficiencies stretch from 2009 to as recently as \n2016 before they began to be addressed in 2014 by Applicant and her tax attorney. \nTherefore, I cannot find that they are mitigated under AG \u00b6 20(a).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s tax problems were triggered by the depression of 2006 and 2007, after \nApplicant had already taken a new position in State No. 2. Although her employment was \nnot adversely affected, her spouse\u2019s real estate and construction-based employment was \nseriously adversely affected. He was unemployed or underemployed for about three \nyears. The family income was cut in about half of what it had been in State No. 1. That \nnationwide economic depression was wholly beyond Applicant\u2019s control. The first prong \nof AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. The next inquiry is whether Applicant acted responsibly under those \nadverse conditions.  \n \nIn 2012, Applicant and her spouse enrolled in a budgeting and money \nmanagement course offered by a local university. By 2013, Applicant\u2019s spouse had found \nfull time employment, at a much lower salary than he was making in State No. 1, but it \nwas steady. Although Applicant could then stay current with household expenses, she \ncould not address delinquent debts. Therefore, she sought new employment and found a \nposition that paid more and came with a signing bonus. Applicant used her augmented \npay to address consumer debt to avoid garnishment.  \n \n\n10 \n \nHaving resolved her delinquent consumer debt, Applicant retained a tax attorney \nin 2014 to address tax issues. That led to an installment agreement signed in June 2017. \nApplicant has faithfully adhered to that agreement. Only the 2017 tax returns need to be \nfinalized by her tax attorney. An applicant is not required to show that every financial \nconcern in the SOR has been resolved. Rather, an applicant is required to demonstrate \nthat he or she has \u201cestablished a plan to resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken \nsignificant actions to implement that plan.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2 (App. Bd. May \n21, 2008). See also ISCR Case No. 14-00504 at 3 (Aug. 4, 2014).) Applicant\u2019s plan in \nfacing financial adversity was methodical and responsible. She has established a track \nrecord of following her plan. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), (c), and (g) apply to mitigate the security \nconcern under Guideline F.2   \n \nThe record does not raise doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \ngood judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I \nweighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed \nthe unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person \nconcept. (AG \u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).)  Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant met her ultimate \nburden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nhis eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):      For Applicant \n     Subparagraphs 1.a-h:  \n \n \n               For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant Applicant access to classified information.   \n \n \n \n____________________ \nPhilip J. Katauskas \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n                                                          \n2 Applicant completed her security clearance application in August 2014 and was interviewed in August \n2015. The SOR was not issued until December 2017, after Applicant was already addressing her tax \nproblems. There is nothing in the record suggesting that Applicant was motivated by the security clearance \nprocess to clean up her tax problems. See ISCR Case No. 10-05909 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sep. 27, 2012) \n(Applicant paid his tax debts three months before the hearing). Applicant\u2019s testimony, which I found credible, \nwas that she began addressing consumer debt before tax liabilities to avoid garnishments.  \n\n11 \n \n \n   \n \n \n",

Billett, Esq. \n__________ \nDecision \n__________ \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant illegally possessed and used marijuana between 2002 and February \n2017. He used marijuana after submitting an application for a position of trust in 2013, \nserving in positions of trust in 2013 and 2015, participating in a drug screening test \nwhile in-processing for a position of trust in 2015, and after he was warned by a relative \nabout the possible consequences of his illegal marijuana use. The passage of time so \nfar is insufficient to demonstrate his reliability, trustworthiness, ability to comply with the \nlaw, rules and regulations, and his ability to protect classified information. Drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse security concerns are not mitigated. Clearance \ndenied.  \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on March 3, 2017. \nAfter reviewing the information gathered during the background investigation, the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guideline H (drug involvement and substance misuse) on \nNovember 22, 2017. Applicant answered the SOR and requested a decision based on \nthe record in lieu of a hearing on December 15, 2017. After receiving the Government\u2019s \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM) with the evidence supporting the security concerns \n03/15/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nand the clearance denial, Applicant requested a hearing before an administrative judge \nfrom the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA).  \n \nDOHA assigned the case to me on July 19, 2018. The initial Notice of Hearing \n(NOH) was issued on November 13, 2018, setting a hearing for December 17, 2018. \nApplicant was granted a continuance to retain counsel on November 30, 2018, and the \nhearing was rescheduled for January 29, 2019. At the hearing, the Government offered \ntwo exhibits (GE 1 and 2). Applicant objected to the admissibility of GE 2 (two \nunauthenticated summaries of Applicant\u2019s interviews conducted by background \ninvestigators) pursuant to Section 5 of the Directive. The Government withdrew GE 2, \nand the document was made part of the record, but it was not considered as evidence. \nApplicant testified and submitted six exhibits. (AE 1 through 6) All exhibits were \nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on February 7, \n2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the substance of the sole Guideline \nH allegation \u2013 that he illegally used marijuana between June 2002 and February 2017. \nIn his Answer, he disputed the frequency of his use, the period during which he used it \nmost frequently, and his recent diminishing use of marijuana. His admissions in his \nAnswer to the SOR and at his hearing are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \nthorough review of the record evidence, Applicant\u2019s demeanor while testifying, and his \ntestimony, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 34-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He graduated from \nhigh school in 2003, earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2007, and completed a master\u2019s \ndegree in 2014. He married in 2012, and has two sons, born in 2016, and 2017. This is \nhis first application for a clearance, but he had previously applied for and was granted \neligibility for a position of trust in 2013. \n \nApplicant started illegally using marijuana during his last year of high school \n(2002). He continued using marijuana while in college, and after graduate school. He \ntestified that his use was with a close group of friends at intimate party gatherings. (Tr. \n40) He averred that he never sought out marijuana, never purchased it, and that he no \nlonger socializes with his marijuana-using friends. He estimated he used marijuana a \ncouple of times a year. (Tr. 42) Applicant testified he tapered off his illegal use of \nmarijuana around early 2009, when he was offered a job. He continued to use \nmarijuana, but in an annual or semiannual basis. \n \nApplicant used marijuana once or twice a year until about 2016, when he started \nto cut down on his use. He claimed that he did not use marijuana during the two periods \nof nine months in 2013 and 2015, when he held positions of trust. A corporation hired \nApplicant for an internship position while he was a graduate student in about June 2013. \nHe submitted a Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF85P Format) in September \n2013. (GE 1) In his response to Section 21 (Illegal Drugs) he denied using any illegal \n\n \n3 \n \n \ndrugs, including marijuana, during the last year. In his response to Section 23 (Your Use \nof Illegal Drugs or Drug Activity), Applicant disclosed that: in the last seven years he had \nillegally used marijuana \u201ca couple of times\u201d and further qualified his use as \u201ca few times \nwhile a student in college,\u201d between August 2003 and May 2007.  \n \nIn August 2015, Applicant, while working for his current employer, was assigned \nto a position of trust with a federal agency. (Tr. 37) He was required to participate in a \ndrug-screening test when he in-processed for his 2015 position. Applicant claimed that \nhe did not use marijuana while working on the two positions of trust, because he did not \nwant to use it while working in a privileged position, and he had a very busy school \nschedule, was married, and was working. \n \nAfter his assignment to the position of trust ended in 2016, Applicant claimed he \nillegally used marijuana only twice. Once in July 2016 during a summer barbecue party \nwith family and friends, an \u201cold family friend\u201d offered him marijuana and he accepted it. \nHe explained that had had a few beers, was not driving, had no other obligations, felt in \ncontrol of himself, and took \u201ca hit of the joint.\u201d (Tr. 48)  \n \nApplicant claimed that he regretted the incident immediately and began a period \nof reconsidering his behavior. He averred he did not feel great and the incident \nprovoked him anxiety. His father learned about his illegal use of marijuana and asked \nhim, \u201cIs that really something you want to be doing at this point in your life?\u201d His father \nsuggested Applicant put his priorities in order and advised he did not use marijuana \nagain. (Tr. 80) \n \nIn February 2017, Applicant\u2019s soon-to-be brother-in-law was having a three-day \nbachelor\u2019s party in another state with friends and family. Applicant stated that he was \nencouraged by his friends to illegally use marijuana and he did. Applicant claimed that \nhe no longer enjoys using marijuana and that he immediately regretted his illegal \nmarijuana use. Applicant claimed he has no knowledge about his brother-in-law using \nmarijuana again since the bachelor\u2019s party.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s current employer, a federal contractor, hired him in August 2015. \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (SF86 \nFormat) in March 2017. (SCA, GE 1) In his response to Section 23 (Illegal Use of Drugs \nor Drug Activity), Applicant described his illegal use of marijuana as \u201cused very \nsporadically . . . very infrequent use, roughly once a year,\u201d between June 2002 and \nFebruary 2017. He claimed that he did not intend to use drugs of any sort once granted \na security clearance. \n \nApplicant has done well in his analyst position, and was promoted to consultant. \nHe is currently pending further promotion to senior consultant. Both Applicant\u2019s co-\nworker and his counselor consider him to be honest, reliable, and an invaluable asset to \nhis employer. He continuously receives outstanding feedback from clients, coworkers, \nand supervisors. He always conducts himself in a professional manner, works well with \nothers, and frequently takes the initiative in complicated issues. Both references believe \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant is genuinely embarrassed and remorseful about his past use of drugs. They \nstrongly recommended his eligibility for a clearance. I note that Applicant\u2019s counselor \ndid not seem to know the extent of his illegal marijuana use. She referred to his 17-year \nperiod of illegal marijuana use as \u201chis mistake two years ago,\u201d and \u201chis brief lapse in \njudgment.\u201d \n \nApplicant submitted a statement of intent promising never to use any illegal drugs \nagain, and agreeing to the immediate termination of his clearance for any violation. He \nstated that in 2016, he started thinking about the choices he was making and before \ngoing to the bachelor\u2019s party, he had decided to forego marijuana. He explained that the \nuse of marijuana did not represent the person he wants to be or the lifestyle he wants to \nlive. He noted that the demands on his life have increased as he got older. He now has \ntwo children, recently purchased a home, and has been promoted to a more demanding \nposition. \n \nApplicant noted that he has been honest and forthcoming during the clearance \nprocess, disclosing his marijuana use in the 2013 application for eligibility for a trust \nposition and in his 2017 SCA. Applicant claimed he was not aware whether his \nemployer has a policy against the illegal use of drugs. However, he was aware that \npossession of marijuana is illegal under federal law. He claimed that the first instance \nhe realized his illegal marijuana use could be a problem for his clearance was when he \nreceived the SOR. Applicant loves his work and the career opportunities it provides. He \nbelieves that he has been working hard to get to this point in his career. He would like to \nbe trusted with a clearance and to continue his career progression. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June \n8, 2017.    \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \u00a7 2. The \nU.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch \nin regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno \none has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \n\n \n5 \n \n \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered.  \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the security concern for the illegal use of drugs:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802.  \n \nBetween 2002 and February 2017, Applicant illegally possessed and used \nmarijuana. He illegally possessed and used marijuana after getting married in 2012, \nafter submitting his 2013 application for a public trust position and holding public trust \npositions in 2013 and 2015, after participating in an unscheduled drug screening test \nwhile in-processing for his 2015 public trust position, after the birth of his son in early-\n2016, and after being counseled by his father about the possible adverse consequences \n\n \n6 \n \n \nof his illegal marijuana possession and use in 2016. AG \u00b6 25 provides disqualifying \nconditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia \n \nThe record established the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and (c), \nrequiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 26: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \n\u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, \nEnclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant has a 17-year history of illegal \nmarijuana use. He started his possession and use of marijuana during high school \n(2002), and he continued using marijuana until February 2017. His marijuana use was \nrecent, frequent, and did not occur under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. He \nknew that the possession of marijuana was illegal. Moreover, considering his education \nand job experience, he knew the illegal use of drugs was a concern for the Federal \ngovernment because he was asked about it in his 2013 SF85P, and he was required to \nparticipate in a drug-screening test while in-processing for a position of trust in 2015. \nNotwithstanding, he continued his illegal marijuana use until February 2017.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s illegal use of marijuana after submitting an application for a position \nof trust and knowing about the concerns raised by it cast doubts on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations, and suitability to hold a clearance. \n \nI considered that Applicant self-reported his past illegal marijuana possession \nand use in his 2013 application for a position of trust and in his 2017 SCA. I also \nconsidered that he promised in his SCA and at his hearing to stop using marijuana in \nthe future. I consider Applicant\u2019s promises to be lacking weight and credibility. Applicant \nknew the possession of marijuana is illegal under Federal law. He became aware of the \nsecurity concerns it raised when he submitted his 2013 position of trust application, \nwhen he participated in a drug screening test in 2015, and when he was counseled by \nhis father about the possible consequences of his marijuana use in 2016. \nNotwithstanding, he was not dissuaded from using marijuana until at least in February \n2017.  \n \nThe DOHA Appeals Board has noted that \u201cDrug involvement after having \ncompleted an SCA draws into serious questions the applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \nwillingness to follow rules and regulations, insofar as it placed the applicant on notice of \nthe consequences of such misconduct.\u201d ISCR Case No. 16-02877, at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. \n2, 2017).  \n \nApplicant provided a signed statement of intent to abstain from further illegal drug \ninvolvement. However, applicants who begin to address their security-significant \nconduct only when their personal interests are at stake may be lacking in judgment and \nreliability. See ISCR Case No. 16-01221 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018). His evidence is \ninsufficient to show that he no longer associates with illegal marijuana users. In 2016, \nhe associated with a college friend and family members during a barbecue and used \nmarijuana in their presence. In 2017, he used marijuana with his now brother-in-law, \nfamily, and friends at a bachelor\u2019s party. More mitigating evidence and additional time \n\n \n8 \n \n \nwithout recurrence of substance misuse is needed for Applicant to establish his \nreliability, trustworthiness, his ability to comply with laws rules and regulations, and his \nsuitability for a clearance. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d). Some of these factors were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \n \nApplicant, 34, has been employed with a federal contractor for about four years. \nHis good performance has been noted. He is a successful and valuable employee and \nhas been promoted accordingly. He disclosed his substance misuse in his 2013 \napplication for a position of trust and in his 2017 SCA. He stated his intent to abstain \nfrom further illegal drug involvement.  \n \nThe factors against granting a clearance are more substantial. Applicant\u2019s lack of \njudgment and his unwillingness to comply with the law, rules, and regulations continue \nto raise questions about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information.
