    "summary": "Findings of Fact After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 49 years old, was thrice married and thrice divorced, the last divorce being in March 2016. As of his November 2021 Answer, Applicant had remarried. He has an adult son. Applicant has an associate\u2019s degree (2006), a bachelor\u2019s degree (2018), and a master\u2019s degree (2019). He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from 1999 until 2011, when he was honorably discharged. Applicant has worked for a defense contractor since October 2018. He was granted a security clearance in December 2008. While working for that defense contractor, Applicant was also self-employed part-time as an insurance producer from February 2011 until February 2013 when his license expired. At the time of his October 2019 SCA, Applicant had lived at the same residence since 2 September 2012 (a rental). (Item 3.) When he answered the SOR, Applicant had moved to a different home (which he owns) but in the same state. (Item 2.) Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant has seven delinquent debts totaling $38,176. (Item 1.) He admitted the SOR allegations with explanations and refers to three credit reports attached to his answer. (Item 2.) More specifically, in admitting these debts, Applicant also answered that he settled or resolved the SOR debts by or before October 13, 2021 (Item 2, \u00b6\u00b6 1.d.- g.) or November 8, 2021 (Item 2, \u00b6\u00b6 1.a.- 1.c).

He was afforded 30 days after receiving the FORM to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant responded to the FORM on \nJanuary 21, 2022. (Item 10). \nIn his response, Applicant objected to three Items in the FORM. (Item 10.) First, \nhe objected to the SOR (Item 1) on the ground that its date \u201cclearly misrepresents the \nactual date.\u201d In his answer to the SOR, however, Applicant did not make any objections. \n(Item 2.) Therefore, his objection was not timely made and was waived. Notwithstanding \nthat waiver, the SOR and the SOR that Applicant answered (Item 2) correctly stated the \ndate to be October 30, 2021. The cover sheet date with \u201cOctober 30,2020\u201d was clearly a \ntypographical error. The first objection has no merit and is overruled. \nSecond, Applicant objected to Item 8, a letter from the CAF to Applicant dated \nJanuary 26, 2009. He contends that there \u201cis no supporting document for the date.\u201d That \nItem is, however, a stand-alone document as one piece of evidence. It is admissible as a \nbusiness record of a regularly conducted activity. Fed. R. Evid. 803(6). The second \nobjection has no merit and is overruled. Items 1 and 8 are admitted over Applicant\u2019s \nobjections. Items 2 through 7, and Item 9 are admitted without objection. \nApplicant\u2019s final objection (although not named as such) to the FORM was that it \ndid not include \u201ca current credit bureau report.\u201d The Directive, however, does not require \nthat a current report be included in the FORM. Credit bureau reports are snapshots of an \napplicant\u2019s financial status at the time they are generated. Applicant himself submitted \nthree credit bureau reports with his answer to the SOR (Item 2) and two other reports that \nare included in the FORM. (Items 5 and 6,) Appellant\u2019s objection is without merit and is \noverruled. \nThis case was assigned to me on March 17, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 49 years old, was thrice married and thrice divorced, the last divorce \nbeing in March 2016. As of his November 2021 Answer, Applicant had remarried. He has \nan adult son. Applicant has an associate\u2019s degree (2006), a bachelor\u2019s degree (2018), \nand a master\u2019s degree (2019).

(Item 3.) When he answered the SOR, Applicant had moved \nto a different home (which he owns) but in the same state. (Item 2.) \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant has seven delinquent debts \ntotaling $38,176. (Item 1.) He admitted the SOR allegations with explanations and refers \nto three credit reports attached to his answer. (Item 2.) More specifically, in admitting \nthese debts, Applicant also answered that he settled or resolved the SOR debts by or \nbefore October 13, 2021 (Item 2, \u00b6\u00b6 1.d.- g.) or November 8, 2021 (Item 2, \u00b6\u00b6 1.a.- 1.c). \nThe credit reports also show that the seven SOR debts were in collection or charge-off \nstatus (sometimes both), some as far back as April 2018. (Items 2 and 4 through 7. Items \n5 and 6 are credit reports submitted by Applicant. In his response to the FORM, Applicant \nsubmitted documents showing a payment made on September 14, 2020, to the \ncollections creditor of SOR \u00b6 1.f. He also submitted documents showing he settled the \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and b. on November 8, 2021. (Item 10.) \nUnder Guideline E, SOR \u00b6 2.a. alleged that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose \nthe delinquent accounts listed in SOR \u00b6 1 on his October 2019 SCA. (Item 1.) Applicant \ndenied that allegation. (Item 2.) He offered a number of explanations. First, Applicant \ncalled the omissions of the seven delinquent accounts from his SCA an \u201cerror.\u201d Second, \nhe mentioned that he was going through a divorce. Third, Applicant noted that he was \n\u201cuncertain\u201d of the legality of some of those debts. Fourth, he stated that he had started a \nbusiness and guaranteed some of the start-up expenses of that business. (Item 2.) During \nApplicant\u2019s Personal Subject Interviews (PSIs), he was asked about his delinquent \naccounts. Applicant agreed that those were his accounts. He was also asked why each \nof those accounts was omitted from his SCA. Applicant responded that those accounts \nwere omitted due to an \u201coversight.\u201d (Item 9.) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other\nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following are potentially applicable in this case: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) an unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe guideline also includes conditions under AG \u00b6 20 that could potentially mitigate \nsecurity concerns arising from financial difficulties. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and, \n(c) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nA security clearance adjudication is not a debt-collection process. Rather, an \nadministrative judge examines the way an applicant handles his personal financial \nobligations to assess how they may handle their security obligations. Here, Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance eligibility was called into question by his past financial problems. The \nSOR debts are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and the Government\u2019s and \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports. I conclude that disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b619(a), (b), and (c) \napply. The next inquiry is whether any mitigating conditions apply. \nApplicant\u2019s seven delinquent debts were not infrequent. And some of the debts \nbecame delinquent in 2018. Those delinquencies persisted until Applicant resolved them \nin October 2020 and November of 2021. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant noted a number of circumstances that caused his financial problems: a \ndivorce, expenses from a new business, the closing of that business, and questions about \nthe legality of some debts. I considered that those individually or taken together could \nhave been \u201cconditions . . . largely beyond [Applicant\u2019s] control,\u201d as contemplated by AG \u00b6 \n20(b). That, however, does not end the inquiry. AG \u00b6 20(b) also requires that Applicant \nact \u201cresponsibly under the circumstances.\u201d \nIn this case, Applicant began the security clearance process in October 2019, \nwhen he submitted his SCA. The credit reports in the record (two from the Government \nand five from Applicant) showed that the SOR debts were in existence at that time. \nApplicant admitted that those debts were delinquent when he answered the SOR in \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nNovember 2021. He resolved those debts by paying them in October 2020 and three of \nthem in November 2021, which was after the SOR was issued and after Applicant\u2019s PSIs \n(in November and December 2019). The conclusion is inescapable that the security \nclearance process motivated Applicant to address his delinquent debts. I find that \nApplicant did not act responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nFor the same reasoning, I find that AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply (lack of good faith). See \nISCR Case No. 15-03208 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, 2017); ISCR Case No. 10-05909 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 27, 2012). \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nIn assessing an allegation of deliberate falsification, I consider not only the \nallegation and Applicant\u2019s answer but all relevant circumstances. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-\n(9) (explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). Under Guideline E for personal \nconduct, AG \u00b6 15 states the concern that \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack \nof candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information.\u201d A statement is false or dishonest when it was made deliberately \n(knowingly and willfully). An omission of relevant and material information is not deliberate \nif, for example, the person genuinely forgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, \nmisunderstood the question, reasonably did not know the information, or genuinely \nthought the information did not need to be reported. \nMore specifically, AG \u00b6 16(a) states the following potentially disqualifying \ncondition: \ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from  any  \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form \nused to conduct investigations [or] . . . determine national security eligibility. \nIn this case, the SOR alleged that Applicant falsified facts by failing to disclose his \nseven financial delinquencies on his SCA. Applicant denied that allegation. He called his \nomissions errors and the result of \u201coversight.\u201d His longstanding debts, however, totaled \nmore than $38,000. Debts of that magnitude are difficult to overlook, especially if \nApplicant, as he claims, had recently been through a divorce. And Applicant is well-\neducated and has been through the security clearance process before. He was granted \na security clearance in 2008. There is no record that Applicant was engaged in extensive \nforeign travel or deployments. He lived in the same residence since 2012 and moved only \nrecently but stayed in the same state. Therefore, Applicant was presumably not out of the \nreach of his creditors. He could have communicated with them about his debts. There \nis nothing in the record suggesting that he did so, except after the clearance process \nstarted. In addition, he demonstrated in this proceeding his facility with credit reports. I \nconclude that Applicant deliberately falsified his SCA by omitting his seven SOR debts. \nTherefore, I find AG \u00b6 16(a) applicable, and I find against Applicant on SOR \u00b6 2.a. \nI also considered the potentially mitigating conditions enumerated in AG \u00b6 17.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 29 years old. He is married and has four young children, all under age seven. He worked for a federal contractor as an information technology specialist starting in April 2019, but recently left their employment to pursue other job opportunities. As stated above, he is subject to rehire by this contractor if his clearance is granted. He served in the Army for eight years before receiving an honorable discharge at the end of his enlistment. He holds a bachelor\u2019s degree.

The DOD acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nWith an undated submission, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a \nhearing. The case was assigned to me on February 18, 2022.

The Government offered exhibits \n(GE) 1 through 3, which were admitted into evidence without objection. The \nGovernment\u2019s exhibit list was marked as hearing exhibit (HE) I and its discovery letter \nwas marked as HE II. Applicant testified, but did not offer any exhibits at the hearing, \nand he chose not to keep the record open for additional submissions. DOHA received \nthe hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 20, 2022. \nProcedural Issues \nTwo procedural issues came up at the hearing. During Applicant\u2019s testimony, he \nstated that he had voluntarily terminated his employment with the federal contractor who \nis sponsoring him for a security clearance. He also clarified that he was subject to \nreemployment with that contractor should his clearance be granted. Department \nCounsel proffered that he had his administrative \noffice \ncheck \nApplicant\u2019s \nemployment/jurisdictional status while we were in the hearing (presumably using the \nDISS/CATS database information), and he confirmed that Applicant was still being \nsponsored for a security clearance. Based upon the foregoing representation by \nDepartment Counsel, I find that DOHA has jurisdiction over this case. (Tr. 20-21, 46) \nThe second issue concerns the Government\u2019s concession and decision not to go \nforward with the allegations stated in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.c. because they do not constitute \ndisqualifying behavior under Guideline I. Based upon Department Counsel\u2019s position \nand my own analysis of the allegations, I find in favor of Applicant concerning SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a - 1.c as not establishing disqualifying conduct under Guideline I. (Tr. 9-10) \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer, he admitted all the SOR allegations, with explanations. \nThe admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 29 years old. He is married and has four young children, all under \nage seven. He worked for a federal contractor as an information technology specialist \nstarting in April 2019, but recently left their employment to pursue other job \nopportunities. As stated above, he is subject to rehire by this contractor if his clearance \nis granted. He served in the Army for eight years before receiving an honorable \ndischarge at the end of his enlistment. He holds a bachelor\u2019s degree. (Tr. 5, 17-19; GE \n1) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant: (1) voluntarily sought inpatient treatment in October \n2018 and received a working diagnosis of major depressive disorder, severe, and was \nconsidered a high safety risk because he presented with suicide ideations; (2) was seen \nin a triage clinic after his inpatient hospitalization in October 2018 and reported having \nhallucinations by seeing apparitions; (3) was evaluated in July 2021 by a clinical \npsychologist who diagnosed him with persistent depressive disorder, with mood \ncongruent psychotic features and schizoaffective disorder, depressive type; he further \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngave a guarded prognosis to Applicant. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d - 1.f) (Note: as indicated above, \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.c are decided in favor of Applicant and will not be further addressed). \nApplicant reported a history of psychological issues that started when he was \napproximately 8 to 10 years old. He testified that at that age, he first saw apparitions \nthat he described as \u201cspiritual beings\u201d that were sometimes solid and sometimes \nfloating. He also saw a self-described demon with horns who spoke to him. He stated \nthat both his mother and grandmother experienced seeing such apparitions. He claims \nthat last time he saw a spiritual being was in 2018, when his wife was in the hospital \nhaving their second child. While in the hospital, he claims that he saw a girl walk \nthrough a closed elevator. He also admitted that he had suicidal ideations starting when \nhe was 10 or 11 years old. These were mostly thoughts about committing suicide, but \non two occasions he acted out his thoughts by cutting his wrists and by jumping off a \nbridge. He claims not to have acted upon similar thoughts since he was a child. (Tr. 27-\n30, 33, 35, 38-39)   \nMore recently, his psychological issues presented themselves in 2018, when \nApplicant was still in the Army. In February 2018, Applicant self-referred to the behavior \nhealth clinic (BHC) because he was having passive suicidal thoughts since October or \nNovember 2017. He continued seeing providers in the BHC in the following months. \nMedical records from March 21, 2018, show that he was diagnosed with major \ndepressive disorder. During Applicant\u2019s continuing BHC appointments, in August 2018, \nhe was evaluated for an alcohol use disorder, which was confirmed by a diagnosis, in a \nmild state. However, Applicant had no duty restrictions. Applicant was seen in the BHC \nin September 2018 with no significant changes to his situation. On October 11, 2018, \nApplicant self-referred to the BHC triage clinic and described that he believed his unit \nwas not taking care of him by forcing him to participate in training rather than allowing \nhim to get surgery on his injured shoulder. He told the BHC staff that if he did not get \nadmitted to the hospital, he would cut his wrists. Thereafter, he was escorted to the \nhospital emergency room. Upon evaluation, Applicant indicated that he had suicidal \nthoughts once a week and they extended back over the last month. He was admitted to \nthe psychiatric ward of the hospital. During his October 16, 2018 safety check after his \ndischarge from the psychiatric ward, Applicant told his provider that he sees apparitions \nin the form of a boy or a girl. He claimed to have seen one apparition that day. \nApplicant\u2019s provider characterized him as having a high risk of self-harm. Applicant has \nnot sought counseling, therapy, or treatment since he left the Army in 2018. When he \nwas asked why he had not sought treatment or counseling when he could easily do so \nfrom the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), he responded \u201cI honestly can\u2019t answer \nthat, sir, I don\u2019t know myself.\u201d He claimed not to have had suicide ideations since 2018. \n(Tr. 31-32, 39; GE 3) \nIn July 2021, Applicant underwent a psychological assessment at the request of \nthe DOD CAF. A licensed psychologist (Dr. X) performed the assessment and issued a \nwritten report. The assessment consisted of a records review, a one-hour clinical \ninterview, and three hours of psychological testing and interpretation.

Applicant\u2019s prognosis was characterized as \u201cguarded.\u201d \nHis psychological testing suggested that he is likely to be \u201chighly treatment resistant.\u201d \nApplicant agreed with Dr. X\u2019s assessment. Dr. X concluded that \u201csubject\u2019s mental health \nseems precarious enough to create a potential risk to national security.\u201d  (Tr. 39-40; GE \n2) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of seeking \nmental health counseling.   \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 28. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and \nthat may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, \nbut not limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehaviors; \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization. \nApplicant\u2019s behavior in expressing suicidal ideations in 2018 and his belief in \nseeing apparitions cast doubt on his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. He was \nvoluntarily hospitalized in the psychiatric ward in 2018 for expressing his intent to do \nself-harm. Both AG \u00b6\u00b6 28(a) and 28(c) apply. A mental health professional (Dr. X) \ndiagnosed Applicant with persistent depressive disorder and with schizoaffective \ndisorder.

Applicant did not \npresent evidence of a medical opinion contrary to Dr. X\u2019s, who gave him a guarded \nprognosis and indicated he was treatment resistant. AG \u00b6 29(c) does not apply. \nApplicant has seen apparitions and attempted or thought of self-harm dating back to \nwhen he was a child, indicating his conditions are not temporary, nor have they been \nresolved. AG \u00b6 29(d) does not apply. Based upon Dr. X\u2019s 2021 diagnoses and \nprognosis, Applicant still has current psychological problems. AG \u00b6 29(e) does not \napply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n___________________________ \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s honorable \nmilitary service, and the treatment he received in 2018. However, I also considered that \nhe has significant diagnosed medical conditions that, without treatment, could impair his \njudgment. Applicant failed to provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the psychological \nconditions security concerns. If Applicant were to receive proper medical treatment for \nhis diagnosed conditions in the future, that action would certainly be positively viewed \nwere he to submit a reapplication. \nOverall the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline I. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs   1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs   1.d-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

It makes little difference for our \npurposes, and I will refer to all of them as paid by Applicant. \nApplicant and his wife were sued by a bank for a debt that was not alleged in the \nSOR. He paid $500 toward this debt in November 2019 and another $500 in June 2020. \nIn September 2020, the bank offered to accept $4,751 in settlement of the $10,559 \ndebt. Applicant accepted the settlement and paid that amount to the creditor with a \ncredit card in September 2020.

A collection company on behalf of a \nbank obtained a judgment of $22,987 against Applicant and his wife (SOR \u00b6 1.e). His \nwages were ordered to be garnished in August 2020. His pay was garnished $697 \nevery two weeks. Applicant\u2019s December 2020 pay statement showed that $6,215 had \nbeen garnished from his pay year-to-date.

(Tr. at 36-37, \n41-42; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2; AE 5) \nIn December 2021, the bank for the $21,370 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b \n(Applicant\u2019s wife account) issued an IRS Form 1099-C (Cancellation of Debt) to \nApplicant\u2019s wife, which cancelled or forgave $19,981 of the debt. The bank considers \nthe debt resolved and listed it on the October 2022 credit report with a $0 balance. The \ncancellation affected their taxes for 2021 resulting in a larger than normal tax liability. \nHe paid the IRS $4,167 in October 2022. (Tr. at 38-39; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; \nGE 2,4-8; AE 6, 10) \nThe bank that held the $88,166 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a obtained a judgment \nof $88,166 plus $406 costs against Applicant and his wife in October 2019. A \ngarnishment order was quashed, but the judgment is still in effect. No payments have \nbeen made toward the judgment. (Tr. at 35-38; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 4-8; \nAE 9) \nA collection company on behalf of a bank obtained a judgment of $18,311 plus \n$347 costs against Applicant and his wife in 2020 (SOR \u00b6 1.f).

(Tr. at 23, 31, 34, 40, 44; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 2) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including delinquent debts and \nunpaid judgments. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) are applicable. \nApplicant was only an authorized user of the $21,370 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b \nand not legally responsible for the debt. SOR \u00b6 1.b is concluded for Applicant. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \nApplicant admitted that he and his wife failed to manage their finances \nappropriately. They did not communicate about their finances, and when they did, it led \nto discord. They both had medical problems, and they had expenses related to their \nchildren\u2019s athletic competitions. Applicant\u2019s finances were partially beyond his control. \nWhen the SOR \u00b6 1.b debt in his wife\u2019s name is eliminated, the remaining debts \nand judgments totaled about $164,000 before payments. The judgments in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d \n($13,346) and 1.e ($22,835) were paid by garnishment. Those debts are mitigated. \nHowever, court-ordered or otherwise involuntary means of debt resolution, such as \ngarnishment, are entitled to less weight than means initiated and carried through by the \ndebtor himself. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). \nApplicant is also credited with paying about $7,879 to resolve five debts that were not \nalleged in the SOR. He paid the large tax bill that resulted when a creditor cancelled a \n$19,981 debt in his wife\u2019s name. Any matter that was not alleged in the SOR will not be \nused for disqualification purposes. It may be considered when assessing Applicant\u2019s \noverall financial situation, in the application of mitigating conditions, and in the whole-\nperson analysis. \nApplicant still owes about $127,900 for a delinquent debt and two unpaid \njudgments. He stated that he plans to pay the debts. However, intentions to resolve \nfinancial problems in the future are not a substitute for a track record of debt repayment \nor other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, \n2013). \nAG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \nnational security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d There is \ninsufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial problems will be \nresolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. His financial \nissues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. There are no mitigating conditions applicable to \nthe unpaid debt and judgments. Applicant may reach a point where his finances are \nsufficiently in order to once again warrant a security clearance, but he has not \nestablished that he is there at this time. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nlong employment record while holding a security clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

The SOR, as amended, alleged that Applicant incurred eleven delinquent debts or financial concerns owed to creditors on accounts including auto, utility, consumer debt, and a mortgage that went into foreclosure, among other debts that were charged off or placed for collection, totaling approximately $40,000. Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2016, that was dismissed. In his answer, Applicant admits all of the allegations under this guideline except 1.b. and 1.g.

In the past seven years have you defaulted on any type of loan? . . . In the past \nseven years have you had bills or debt turned over to a collection agency? . . . In the \npast seven years, have you had any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or \ncancelled for failing to pay as agreed? . . . In the last seven years, have you been \nevicted for nonpayment? . . . or were your wages, benefits, or assets garnished or \nattached for any reason? In the past seven years have you been over 120 days \ndelinquent on any debt not previously entered? . . . Are you currently over 120 days \ndelinquent on any debt?\u201d Applicant answered, \u201cNO,\u201d and failed to list that he had been \ndelinquent on debts in the past seven years, as noted in Guideline F above. \nOn the same application, dated May 5, 2020, Applicant, in response to Section \n26 concerning his financial record, was asked, \u201cIn the past seven years have you filed a \npetition under any chapter of the bankruptcy code. Applicant answered, \u201cNO,\u201d and \nfailed to disclose his Chapter 13 Bankruptcy filing in 2016. \nApplicant intentionally omitted information about certain debts on his security \nclearance application. He states that he failed to disclose his 2016 bankruptcy based \non advice he received from someone in his company\u2019s security department. \n(Government Exhibit 5.) This information is not controverted. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nvariables known as the whole-person concept.

AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant incurred significant delinquent debt that he has not paid. There is \ninsufficient information in the record to conclude why or how it occurred, or whether he \nis financially stable, or if he can afford his lifestyle, or if he has the financial resources \navailable to handle his financial obligations. There is no evidence in the record to show \nthat any regular monthly payments of any sort are being made toward his debts. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under Financial Considerations are potentially \napplicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nThe record is void of mitigation. Applicant remains delinquently indebted and \npresented no evidence to show that he has made any effort to resolve his debts. \nFurthermore, there is no evidence in the record to show that circumstances beyond the \nApplicant\u2019s control contributed to his financial difficulties. There is no evidence in the \nrecord to show how or why Applicant became so delinquently indebted. What is known \nis that Applicant has been gainfully employed since 2013, and yet remains excessively \nindebted. None of the mitigating conditions apply. This guideline is found against the \nApplicant. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for the personal conduct guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n.(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I have \nconsidered each of the mitigating conditions below: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports reveal that he is delinquently indebted. He admits that \nhe knew about his delinquent debts at the time he completed the security clearance \napplication. \nApplicant deliberately concealed his financial delinquencies from the \ngovernment on this application. There is no excuse for this dishonesty. Deliberately \nconcealing material information from the Government on a security clearance \napplication raises serious questions about one\u2019s credibility and trustworthiness. None of \nthe mitigating conditions are applicable. Allegation 2.a., is found against Applicant. \nIn regard to allegation 2.b., of the SOR, since Applicant relied on wrong advice \nfrom someone in his company\u2019s security department as to why he marked \u201cNO,\u201d in \nresponse to the question concerning whether he had filed bankruptcy, this allegation will \nbe found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant failed to respond to \nthe FORM, and submitted little to no information in mitigation. Accordingly, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a., through 1,j., and 1.l. \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.k., 1.m., and 1.n. \nWithdrawn \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a. \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b. \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquencies, that includes a mortgage, a \ndebt for professional services, credit cards, a telecommunications debt, medical debts, \nand a utility debt. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions \nand shifts the burden to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;   \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to having insufficient funds to pay a \nresidential mortgage and a residential lease simultaneously. Applicant averred that his \nneed to pay both was necessitated because he had moved from State A to State B and \ncould not sell the home he owned in State A. He asserted that a realtor told him that he \nwould be able to sell the home in State A. However, the record contains insufficient \nevidence to show why this decision was beyond his control. Based upon the timing of a \nchange in his employment, his move may have been necessary to change jobs. \nHowever, Applicant does not provide evidence of that assumption, nor does he provide \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nevidence that moving prior to selling his home was anything other than a voluntary \nchoice. Applicant\u2019s unemployment was beyond his control. Applicant\u2019s cessation of \npayments on his credit card debts in anticipation of a bankruptcy that he did not file was \nwithin his control. \nApplicant provided no documentary evidence of payments or favorable resolution \nof the SOR debts. Applicant stated that he intends to pay some of the SOR debts. \nHowever, intentions to pay debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of \ndebt repayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). Applicant provided no documents in his response to the SOR \nor in response to the FORM. It is reasonable to expect Applicant to present \ndocumentation about the resolution of specific debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-\n03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2016).  \nWhile Applicant claimed to have consulted two bankruptcy attorneys to help him \nresolve his financial issues, he has not provided evidence of any progress. Therefore, I \nam unaware of financial counseling or of efforts to resolve financial issues. \nApplicant alleged that he would dispute at least one of the SOR debts. However, \nhe provided no documentary evidence to substantiate the basis of his dispute. \nApplicant moved from to State A to State B ten years ago. He has worked for his \ncurrent employer for over five years. Most of his SOR debts have been delinquent for \nseveral years. There is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial problems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that \nhe acted responsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay \nhis debts. His financial issues are ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Financial considerations security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.m: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

Applicant completed \ntwo contracts as a command director for a government agency. He is being sponsored \nfor a federal contract position, and this is his first security clearance application (SCA). \n(Item 3) \nThe SOR (Item 1) alleged under Guideline H that Applicant used cocaine with \nvarying frequency from about November 1994 to about January 2021 (1.a); used \nmarijuana with varying frequency from about August 1993 to about March 2020 (1.b); \nused prescription medication Xanax, which was not prescribed to him, with varying \nfrequency from about 2005 to about 2013 (1.c;); used Adderall, which was not \nprescribed to him, from about 2005 to about 2013; (1.d); Vicodin, which was not \nprescribed to him, in about November 2014.(1.e) In his Answer, Applicant admitted to \nthe SOR allegations with explanations and clarifications on his drug usage.

He added \nthat he does not go looking for controlled substances, \u201cbut there were times when he \ndid not say \u201cNo. when drugs were offered.\u201d (Item 2) He also talked about peer pressure \nin terms of socialization. He now knows that it is not good for him and he will not use \nagain. He, however, did not relate any of his illegal drug usage to any federal \nemployers.

He knows \u201cmost companies\u201d follow the Federal law. \n(Item 4) He again stated that he has not reported his drug use to his prospective \nFederal employer, but he would if asked to do so. (Item 4) He signed a Letter of Intent \nand stated that he would avoid those people who used drugs. \nDuring his February 12, 2021 subject interview, Applicant provided details \nregarding his varying use of illegal drugs and substances since 1993. He used with \nfriends in social settings because it was the thing to do. In 2020, he visited his sister and \ndecided to use marijuana. He acknowledged the use of marijuana from 1994 to 2014, \nand the use of Vicodin, Adderall, and Xanax. He admitted the cocaine use from 1994 to \n2021.

(Item 5) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the \nnational interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for this guideline is set forth in AG \u00b6 24, where it is noted \nthat the illegal use of a controlled substance, and the use of other substances that can \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose, can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness. This is because such behavior may lead to physical or psychological \nimpairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions establish that he used marijuana and other drugs as \nalleged in the SOR. The record also establishes that Applicant used illegal drugs after \nbeing employed with a Federal contractor. Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana after he knew \nthat his position with a federal contactor required him to refrain from drugs shows a \ndisregard for rules and regulations. Applicant\u2019s history of substance abuse outweighs \nthe mitigating value of his intent to abstain from drug use. His use goes back to 1993. \nHe has a long track record of substance abuse. This is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 25(a): \nany substance misuse, AG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, \nincluding \u2026 or sale; AG \u00b6 25(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such \nmisuse. The Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline H. Therefore, the burden shifts to Applicant to \nproduce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate related security concerns. \nUnder Guideline H, conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \ndrug involvement and substance misuse are enumerated. The following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 26 potentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome this problem, \nand has established a pattern of abstinence, including but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing \nor avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse \nis grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.   \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s last use of marijuana, an illegal substance, took place in 2020.

He \nultimately signed a Statement of Intent but his history of substance abuse outweighs the \nmitigating value of his Statement of Intent to abstain from drug use.

In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has significant past-due indebtedness. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. He has a long history of \ndelinquencies. Applicant still has about $28,360 in past-due indebtedness. He has not \ndemonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has \nnot been established. Financial Consideration is found against Applicant. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis. Applicant appears to be doing well at his present employment. (AppX B.) \nHowever, overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial Considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d. and 1.e.: \nAgainst Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana on various occasions between at least August 1998 and November 2020 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). (Item 1.)

On March 23, 2022, Department Counsel submitted a File of \nRelevant Material (FORM), consisting of documents identified as Items 1 through 5 and a \nstatement of the Government\u2019s position. The Government forwarded the FORM to \nApplicant on March 31, 2022, and advised her that she had 30 days from receipt of the \nFORM to submit any material in response. Applicant received the FORM on April 8, 2022. \nNo response to the FORM was received by the May 8, 2022 deadline. On June 15, 2022, \nthe case was assigned to me to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the interests \nof national security to grant or continue a public trust position for Applicant. I received the \ncase assignment and file on June 20, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana on various \noccasions between at least August 1998 and November 2020 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). (Item 1.) When \nApplicant responded to the allegation, she admitted that she had used marijuana on \nvarious occasions in the past, but also stated that she no longer used marijuana and did \nnot intend to use the drug in the future. (Item 3.) After considering the FORM, which \nincludes the pleadings as Items 1 and 3, I make the following findings of fact: \nApplicant is 36 years old, married, and the mother of two children ages 6 and 8. She \nhas a bachelor\u2019s degree earned in August 2007. She has been working as a manager for \nher current employer since March 2015. (Item 4.) \nOn November 25, 2020, Applicant completed and certified as accurate a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) for a public trust position. In response \nto an SF 86 inquiry into whether she had illegally used any drugs or controlled substances \nin the last seven years, Applicant disclosed that she had occasionally used \u201cTHC\u201d \n(tetrahydrocannabinol) for medicinal and recreational purposes between August 1988 \n[sic]and November 2020. She answered \u201cYes\u201d to whether she intends to use the drug in \nthe future. (Item 4.) \nOn January 11, 2021, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for \nthe Office of Personnel Management (OPM). She corrected the date to August 1998 for \nher first use of marijuana, and admitted that she used marijuana on a quarterly basis from \nAugust 1998 to November 2020. She reported that she uses marijuana for stress and \nanxiety relief alone in her home; that she obtains the marijuana that she used at no cost \nfrom a friend, whom she did not identify; and that she continues to associate with persons \nwho use marijuana. She explained that if marijuana was made legal for medicinal use, she \nwould use the drug again. She also indicated that her spouse, her sister, and two of the \nreferences she listed on her SF 86 are aware of her marijuana use. (Item 5.)

She clarified that she is open to using marijuana in the future at her previous \nfrequency if it became legal for recreational use. She stated that marijuana had been \nlegalized for medicinal purposes in her state but that she did not use it for medical reasons \nbecause she had not obtained the documentation authorizing medical marijuana use. She \nasserted that she made a conscious decision to stop using marijuana solely because of its \nillegality. (Item 5.) \nIn November 2021, Applicant was given the opportunity by DOHA to review the \nreports of her subject interviews. She made no changes apart from updating the \ninformation about her supervisor. (Item 5.) When Applicant answered the SOR on March 5, \n2022, she stated that she did not intend to use marijuana in the future because she \n\u201cknow[s] better, and [is] willing and able to comply with laws, rules and regulations in order \nto further establish [her] reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d (Item 3.) \nApplicant was advised in the FORM of the Government\u2019s position that her \n\u201cpurported abstinence for the past year and a half\u201d was not sufficient to mitigate the \nconcerns raised by her illegal marijuana use over an extended period. She did not respond \nto the FORM. Available information does not indicate whether Applicant continues to \nassociate with persons known to her to use marijuana, including the friend who provided \nher the marijuana that she was using as of November 2020. Applicant provided no \ncorroboration for her assertions that she no longer uses marijuana. \nPolicies \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d The \nstandard that must be met for assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available \ninformation, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning the \nperson to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with national security. The Deputy Under \nSecretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) Memorandum, dated November \n14, 2004, indicates trustworthiness adjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by \nthe Defense Security Service and Office of Personnel Management. Department of \nDefense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the \nDirective before any final unfavorable access determination may be made. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nadjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is \u201can examination of a sufficient period and a careful weighing of a \nnumber of variables\u201d known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsider all available reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those \nconclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the \nrecord. \nThe person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. See Executive Order \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe trustworthiness concerns about drug involvement and substance misuse are set \nforth in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above  . \nIn addition to the above matters, I note that, effective May 17, 2016, the use of \nmedical marijuana became legal in the state where Applicant lives and works. Under that \nlaw, marijuana can only be dispensed to a patient certified for medical marijuana use and \npossessing a valid identification card for medical marijuana. Recreational use of marijuana \nremains illegal in her state. Moreover, marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance \nunder federal law pursuant to Title 21, Section 812 of the United States Code. Schedule I \ndrugs are those which have a high potential for abuse; have no currently accepted medical \nuse in treatment in the United States; and lack accepted safety for use of the drug under \nmedical supervision. \nOn October 25, 2014, the then Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued \nguidance that changes to laws by some states and the District of Columbia to legalize or \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndecriminalize the recreational use of marijuana do not alter existing federal law or the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines, and that an individual\u2019s disregard of federal law \npertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations. \nMoreover, on December 21, 2021, the current DNI issued clarifying guidance \nconcerning marijuana, noting that prior recreational use of marijuana by an individual may \nbe relevant to security adjudications, but is not determinative in the whole-person \nevaluation. Relevant factors in mitigation include the frequency of use and whether the \nindividual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur. The DNI also made clear \nthat products that contain more than 0.3 percent of THC remain illegal to use under federal \nlaw and policy. \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana on about a quarterly basis from August 1998 to \nNovember 2020 establishes disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany substance misuse.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 25(c), \u201cillegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia,\u201d applies \nin that Applicant possessed marijuana illegally. She obtained the marijuana that she used \nalone in her home in recent years at no cost from a friend. AG \u00b6 25(g), \u201cexpressed intent to \ncontinue drug involvement and substance misuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly \ncommit to discontinue such misuse,\u201d warrants some discussion. As of her November 2020 \nSF 86, her marijuana use was current, and she intended to continue using marijuana in the \nfuture. When interviewed by the OPM investigator in January 2021, Applicant expressed \nthat she would consider using marijuana again if it became legal for recreational purposes. \nShe now denies any intention to use marijuana in the future. While AG \u00b6 25(g) no longer \napplies, there are other relevant considerations, such as the duration and circumstances of \nher drug involvement. \nApplicant bears the burden of establishing that matters in mitigation apply to her \nillegal marijuana possession and use. AG \u00b6 26 provides for mitigation as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non an individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or drug involvement and substance \nisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to:\nm\n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \nillegal drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness during \nwhich these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including, \nbut not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without \nrecurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical \nprofessional. \nGiven that Applicant used marijuana over two decades, including in recent years to \nrelieve symptoms of anxiety and stress, AG \u00b6 26(a) cannot reasonably apply. Assuming \nthat she used marijuana quarterly, she would have used marijuana approximately 85 times \nsince August 1998. Her marijuana use started when she was only 13 years old and \ncontinued throughout high school and college; after she married and had children; and \nwhile she held her current employment. Even these significant changes in her personal \ncircumstances did not bring about a cessation of her marijuana use. \nThere is no evidence that Applicant has used marijuana since she completed her SF \n86 for a public trust position. While her present 18 to 19 months of abstinence weighs in \nher favor, it is only one consideration in assessing the risk of recurrence. As of her January \n2021 interviews with the OPM investigator, she was still associating with known marijuana \nusers and contemplating future marijuana use if it became legal. She now asserts that she \n\u201cknow[s] better\u201d than to continue to use marijuana illegally, but her decades-long disregard \nof both federal and state laws that prohibit the recreational possession and use of \nmarijuana raises considerable doubt about her trustworthiness and reliability. Moreover, \nnot enough is known about her current activities or associates to reasonably assess the \nrisk of recurrence. It is unclear whether she has disassociated herself from her drug-using \nfriends; whether her spouse uses marijuana; or whether she continues to experience the \nstress and anxiety that led her to use marijuana alone in her home in recent years. Even if I \naccept her SOR response as the statement of intent to abstain required under AG \u00b6 \n26(b)(3), neither AG \u00b6 26(b)(1) nor AG \u00b6 26(b)(2) was shown to apply. The evidence of \nrecord is insufficient to mitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse \ntrustworthiness concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of her conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________ \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nApplicant requested a decision on the written record, so it was incumbent on her to \nprovide sufficient information about her circumstances to show that she has put her drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse behind her, and she failed to do so. After applying the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions to the evidence presented, I conclude that it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation at this time. \nFormal Finding \nFormal finding for or against Applicant on the allegation set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, is: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances of record in this case, it is not clearly consistent \nwith national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 60-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for his current employer since June 2019. He held a security clearance from about 1991 to 2011, but it lapsed while he did non-defense work. This is his first application for a security clearance since the lapse. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree earned in 1984, and a master\u2019s degree earned in 1987. He is married with adult children and stepchildren.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant possessed and used marijuana. The above disqualifying conditions are \napplicable. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant has not used any illegal drugs since July 2020. He credibly testified \nthat he does not intend to use illegal drugs in the future. He fully disclosed his drug \ninvolvement on his SF-86 and throughout the security clearance proceedings, which \nbolsters his credibility. He signed a statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. His conduct no longer \ncasts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that Applicant \nhas abstained from illegal drug use for an appropriate period, and that illegal drug use is \nunlikely to recur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines H in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the security concerns under Guidelines H (drug involvement and substance\nmisuse). \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

(GE 1 at 19) In \n1990, he married, and his children were born in 1997 and 1999. (Tr. 22, 104; GE 1 at 22, \n25-26) His spouse is a special education teacher. (Tr. 58) She does not get paid in the \nsummer. (Tr. 74) \nApplicant\u2019s daughter graduated from college one year ago, and his son graduated \nfrom college two years ago.

(Tr. 77-78) His son is unable to find employment, \nand Applicant provides financial support for him. (Tr. 78) \nFinancial Considerations \nAll of the debts on the SOR are owed to the same medical creditor, and the SOR \ncreditor used a single collection agent. Applicant had medical insurance for at least the \nprevious five years, and when he had a surgery, the medical insurance only paid for part \nof surgery or test charges. (Tr. 107) He was billed for the remainder. (Tr. 107-108) He \nwas unsure about the annual cap on charges in his insurance policy. (Tr. 107) He did not \nprovide a copy of his medical insurance policy. \nApplicant paid a law firm $129 monthly since about 2019 or 2020, to verify or \ndispute negative entries on his credit report based on the Fair Credit Reporting Act \n(FCRA). (Tr. 27, 108, 113-114) Applicant provided documentation from the law firm \ncovering the period from January 2021 to present and listing the accounts the law firm \nchallenged. (AE O at 1-52) He also provided sample letters from the law firm to creditors \nasking for verification information from the creditors and disputing negative credit report \nentries. (AE O) For example, from January 2022 to July 2022, the law firm sent letters on \n19 different dates challenging 76 negative credit report account entries, including some \nthat were unrelated to the SOR debts. (AE O) The reason Applicant employed the law \nfirm was to improve his credit score. (Tr. 110-111) He provided sample letters from the \nlaw firm. (AE O) When a negative entry was removed from a credit report, the law firm \ndid not provide the reason for the deleted information. (AE M) The debt could be deleted \nfor a variety of reasons. (Id.) He also pays the law firm $129 monthly to dispute his \ndaughter\u2019s medical debts. (Tr. 112) When the law firm told him a debt owed to the SOR \ncreditor was successfully disputed, he contacted the SOR creditor, and the SOR creditor \nadvised him that he did not owe the debt. (Tr. 116) He did not know why the debts were \ndeleted except in the instances where he paid the debts. (AE M) \nIn 2010, a spider bit Applicant, and he had a MRSA infection. (Tr. 40) He was \nhospitalized for 30 days, and his bill was about $22,000; however, his insurance paid \nmost of the bill. (Tr. 41) He used up the funds in his accounts to pay his medical bills. (Tr. \n42-43) \nApplicant\u2019s October 28, 2015 credit report shows 36 accounts totaling $163,233, \nand all accounts are paid as agreed or with zero balances or both, except for eight medical \ndebts in collections totaling $1,721 for the following amounts: $492; $260; $249; $249; \n$150; $150; $121; and $50. (GE 3 at 11-13) None of the eight accounts in collection are \non his November 28, 2020 credit report or listed on the SOR. (HE 2; GE 4) \nFrom 2016 to 2018, Applicant received treatments for his diabetes and liver. (Tr. \n41-43) In 2018, he had surgery under general anesthesia. (Tr. 39) He lost his employment \nin 2019, at least in part because of his illnesses and an inability to travel. (Tr. 97-98) His \ncompany put him on disability status, and for about two months in late 2019, he was not \npaid. (Tr. 99-100) He used credit cards to live. (Tr. 100) After losing his job in 2019, his \nemployment was sporadic until he received his current employment.

(Tr. 65-66) \nApplicant provided six character statements from friends, coworkers, supervisors, \nand his spouse. (AE G) The general sense of their statements is that Applicant is honest, \nresponsible, diligent, trustworthy, helpful, generous, professional, and reliable. Their \nstatements support continuation of his security clearance. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.

It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).

See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances.

The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d The record evidence establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). \nThe mitigating section, infra, contains discussion of the disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 lists financial considerations mitigating conditions which may be applicable \nin this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, \n2013) concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nAG 20(a) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing \ncourse of conduct and are considered recent. See ISCR 17-03146 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 31, \n2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-08779 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2017)). \nApplicant presented some important mitigating information. He suffered serious \ndebilitating illnesses which adversely affected his finances. He was unable to travel and \nlost his employment. He used credit cards to support his family. His son is autistic, and \nhis son is unable to find employment. He provides financial support for his son, who is \nnow an adult. Applicant\u2019s credit reports reflect numerous paid debts or debts with a zero \nbalances or in paid as agreed status, except for about 32 medical debts ranging from $60 \nto about $3,000. His illnesses and resulting medical debts were largely due to \ncircumstances beyond his control. See ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n. 9 (App. Bd. Jan. \n12, 2007) (citations omitted)). Applicant showed his financial responsibility by maintaining \ncontact with his SOR creditor and attempting to negotiate partial payments to keep debts \ncurrent or establish payment plans for resolution of debts. \nApplicant challenged the veracity of his medical debts, which is a reasonable \napproach, because of the complexity of the medical billing system and corresponding \nmedical insurance. However, the record does not explain why the hospital decided to stop \npursuing about $10,000 in medical debt. Perhaps some of Applicant\u2019s debts should have \nbeen included in his surgical debt and presented to his insurance company for payment \nor presented more than once to his insurance company because of the possibility of \ninsurance payment errors. Perhaps three anesthesiology practitioners were not medically \nnecessary for one surgery, and the hospital realized billing for three anesthesiology \npractitioners was inappropriate. Perhaps the hospital went to the insurance company and \nreceived some additional payments. There are a myriad of possible reasons why some \nmedical bills were forgiven or dropped and other apparently similar medical debts are still \nbeing pursued for payment. The law firm\u2019s requests for verification documentation \nfollowed by removal of negative credit report entries do not establish valid disputes of \nnegative financial entries on Applicant\u2019s credit reports.  \n\u201c[I]t is an applicant\u2019s responsibility to present evidence sufficient to mitigate \nthe concerns raised in the SOR, and the applicant bears the ultimate burden \nof persuasion that he or she should be granted a clearance.

Applicant did not provide a copy \nof his medical insurance policy, and his correspondence with his insurance company, and \nhe did not meet his burden of showing why the hospital dropped some debts and \ncontinued to seek payment of others. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. \nApplicant provided proof that he paid six medical debts totaling $380 from May to \nJuly 2022. He owes the medical creditor about $13,321 for 20 debts. The medical creditor \nis satisfied with his progress in repaying his debts. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort \nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the\napplicant\u2019s debts.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) are established. \nFinancial considerations security concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n12 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 54-year-old information technology technical support problem solver, \nand he has been working for his current employer since September 2020. He has two \nmaster\u2019s degrees, and he is working on his Ph.D. in business administration. In 1990, he \nmarried, and his children were born in 1997 and 1999. His spouse is a special education \nteacher, and she does not get paid in the summer. \nThe vice president of the company where Applicant is employed described him as \nan exceptional employee who is diligent, trustworthy, responsible, competent, and \nhonest. He volunteers in his community, and he is passionate about caring for his family \nand doing good work for his company. The general sense of six character statements is \nthat Applicant is honest, responsible, diligent, trustworthy, helpful, generous, \nprofessional, and reliable. Their statements support continuation of his security clearance. \nSee ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020) (noting admissibility of \u201cgood \nsecurity record,\u201d but commenting that security concerns may nevertheless not be \nmitigated). \nApplicant acted responsibly under the circumstances, when he kept his eight credit \ncards and mortgage in current financial status. He paid his medical debts from 2015, and \nsix medical debts in the last two years. His only delinquent debts are medical, and there \nare currently 20 delinquent medical debts totaling $13,321. He understands that he needs \nto pay his debts, and the conduct required to retain his security clearance. \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating: \n. . . the concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and \nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the \nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6 E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past \n13 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments \non all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and \nconcomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a \ntime. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in \nfurtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.  \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and quotation \nmarks omitted). Applicant understands what he needs to do to establish and maintain his \nfinancial responsibility. His efforts at debt resolution have established a \u201cmeaningful track \nrecord\u201d of debt re-payment. I am confident he will maintain his financial responsibility. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, \nExec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the \nfacts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Applicant mitigated financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.ff:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interest of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n14 \n",

On March 8, 2022, the Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me. Items 1 through 6 are \nadmitted into evidence. \nFindings of Fact  \nIn his Response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations contained in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, and 1.f. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, and 1.d. His admissions are incorporated \ninto these findings of fact. \nApplicant is 32 years old. He earned a high school diploma in May 2009, and a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in September 2020. He served on active duty in the Army from July \n2010 to June 2016, when he received an Honorable medical discharge. He held a security \nclearance during his enlistment that lapsed after his discharge. He and his wife have a \nnine-year-old child. He was unemployed while attending college from February 2017 to \nSeptember 2020. During that time, the family was supported by his wife\u2019s earnings and \nhis disability payments from the Army, although she had to quit working for an unspecified \nperiod due to mental health issues. He is seeking to regain his national security eligibility \nin connection with the graphic design associate position that he obtained with a defense \ncontractor in November 2020. (Item 3; Item 4.) \nAs discussed below, Applicant admitted four of the six delinquent debts alleged in \nthe SOR, totaling $17,078. \nHe said during his December 2020 interview with an \ninvestigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) that he had been using a \ncredit monitoring service for the previous two years to help him monitor his debts and to \ndispute some accounts. He provided no other evidence of progress toward repayment or \nother resolution of those debts. The debts are listed in record credit reports dated August \n17, 2021; and November 18, 2020. (Item 2; Item 4; Item 5; Item 6.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: Applicant denied owing this $18,645 medical collection account, stating \nthat he had never incurred such a debt and suggesting that it might be the same as the \nSOR \u00b6 1.b debt, to which he admitted. Although reported by the collection agency as a \nmedical debt, I conclude that both of these allegations are based on the same underlying \n$12,862 deficiency that resulted from the automobile collateral repossession by a credit \nunion discussed below. The credit reports show this amount to be both the final balance \nowed to the credit union and the amount of the underlying debt, for which the collection \nagency subsequently claimed the interest/fee-inflated $18,645 debt. It is not resolved, but \nrepresents a collection agency\u2019s acquisition and subsequent reporting of the SOR \u00b6 1.b \ncredit union repossession deficiency. (Item 2; Item 4; Item 5; Item 6.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: Applicant and his wife purchased a car for $36,069 while he was in the \nArmy. They could no longer afford to make the required loan payments after his medical \ndischarge, while using available funds for other priorities.

Applicant admitted this debt, but offered no \nevidence of any effort to contact the creditor or otherwise resolve it, despite telling the \nOPM investigator in December 2020 that he would do so immediately. (Item 2; Item 3; \nItem 4; Item 5; Item 6.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: Applicant took out a personal loan from the Army Air Force Mutual Aid\nAssociation while he was still on active duty, but stopped making the $100 monthly \nrepayments when he was discharged in June 2016. The Association placed the unpaid \n$3,504 account balance for collection in September 2018. In December 2020, Applicant \nsaid to the OPM investigator that he would contact the collection agency immediately and \nbegin to repay this delinquency. He provided no evidence of any action since 2016 to \nresolve the debt. (Item 2; Item 3; Item 4; Item 5; Item 6.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: Applicant denied owing an $1,881 debt to a cell phone company that \nhe told the OPM investigator was incurred when he switched service providers in 2018. \nHowever, the relevant credit report entries show that this debt was assigned for collection \nin February 2014. Applicant provided no evidence supporting a reasonable basis for \ndisputing this debt, or showing other action to resolve it. (Item 2; Item 4; Item 5; Item 6.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: Applicant admitted owing the $568 credit card debt that was placed for \ncollection in June 2018. Applicant said he chose to stop paying it when he left the Army \nin June 2016, using his available funds for other purposes. He offered no evidence of any \naction to resolve this debt. (Item 2; Item 4; Item 5; Item 6.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: Applicant admitted that he owes the $144 delinquent debt to a pet\nhospital that was placed for collection in January 2017. He offered no evidence of any\naction to resolve this debt. (Item 2; Item 4; Item 5.) \n \n \nApplicant submitted no evidence concerning income from his current DoD \ncontractor position, or of his regular monthly living expenses, to demonstrate his current \nor foreseeable possibility of financial responsibility. There is no indication he has received \nlegitimate financial counseling or education. The credit bureaus also report that he has \napproximately $50,000 in student loan debt in good standing or deferred. \nThe record contains no evidence concerning Applicant\u2019s job performance, \ntrustworthiness, or character in a professional setting. It is also silent with respect to his \ntrack record in handling sensitive information and observation of security procedures.

In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201c[a]ny determination \nunder this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:  \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred five delinquent consumer debts totaling about $19,000 while \nattending college after his medical discharge from the Army. One of the debts is now held \nby a collection agency claiming an additional $5,783 in fees and interest. He \ndemonstrated no effort to repay any of these debts, despite telling the OPM investigator \nin 2020 that he would do so with the income from his employment with a DoD contractor. \nTwo of these debts involved only $568 and $144 but remain unresolved. These facts \nestablish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the \nburden to Applicant to mitigate the resulting security concerns. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline includes five conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s admitted financial delinquencies: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant failed to establish mitigation under any of these conditions. The multiple \ndelinquent debts of concern are ongoing. His post-Army unemployment was voluntary, \nwhile he attended college. During that time, his family lived off his wife\u2019s earnings, his \ndisability benefits, and around $50,000 worth of student loans that also remain \noutstanding. Applicant offered no evidence of responsible efforts to resolve these \ndelinquencies once he resumed employment in 2020. There are no indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or under control. He admitted incurring these debts, which are \nfully documented in the record credit reports. He offered no substantiated basis to dispute \nthe cellphone debt that he claimed was not legitimate. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \na security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature and \naccountable Army veteran who defaulted on $19,000 in consumer debt in order to use \nhis income for other priorities while he was voluntarily unemployed to attend college for \nseveral years. He demonstrated no attempt, or evident intention, to resolve those debts \nsince he regained employment two years ago. There remains significant potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress, which is most likely to continue. Applicant \nfailed to meet his burden to mitigate the security concerns arising under the Financial \nConsiderations guideline. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n(consolidated into one allegation)\nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c through 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for access to classified information.

Largely due to actions taken by his cohabitant \ngirlfriend, he filed his delinquent returns before they became an issue for his security \nclearance eligibility. He has satisfied his state income-tax delinquency, and has been \nrepaying his past-due federal income taxes since November 2021. Even so, some financial \nconsiderations security concerns persist. Clearance eligibility is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 10, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to \nApplicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR \nexplained why the DCSA CAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him.

On March 1, 2022, the Government indicated it was ready to \nproceed to a hearing. On March 18, 2022, the case was assigned to me to determine \nwhether it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for Applicant. I received the case assignment and file on March 28, \n2022. \nAfter some coordination with the parties, on May 12, 2022, I scheduled a hearing for \nJune 8, 2022. On May 19, 2022, counsel for Applicant entered his appearance. I convened \nthe hearing as scheduled on June 8, 2022. Three Government exhibits (GE 1-3) and one \nApplicant exhibit (AE A) were admitted in evidence. Applicant and a close friend of his \ntestified, as reflected in a hearing transcript (Tr.) received by DOHA on June 21, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file, as required, federal (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and \nstate (SOR \u00b6 1.b) income tax returns for tax years 2014 through 2019, and that, as of \nNovember 2021, he owed delinquent federal taxes of $24,294 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) and state taxes \nof $4,553 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) for tax years 2014 through 2020. When Applicant responded to the \nSOR, he admitted that he failed to file his tax returns by the tax deadlines and that he owed \ndelinquent federal income taxes. He denied that he had any outstanding state taxes as he \nhad satisfied his state tax debt. He indicated that he has taken full responsibility for the \nmistakes he made and that he is current on a monthly payment plan with the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS) for his federal taxes. \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact: \nApplicant is a 54-year-old self-employed master plumber.

(GE \n1; Tr. 45.) \nStruggling with the paperwork for his business and seeking a change, Applicant \napplied for employment with a defense contractor. (Tr. 15-18.)

He admitted owing \nsome federal and state income taxes totaling $1,752 (federal only) for tax year (TY) 2014; \n$13,585 (federal $11,791 and state $1,794) for TY 2015; $9,015 (federal $8,028 and state \n$987) for TY 2016; $13,943 ($11,826 federal and $2,117 state) for TY 2017; $9,877 \n($8,405 federal and $1,472 state) for TY 2018; and $11,052 ($9,462 federal and $1,590 \nstate) for 2019. He reported that he was on a payment plan with the state but still arranging \nfor repayment of his federal taxes with the IRS. (GE 1.) \nOn June 7, 2021, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). He explained that he was paying $748 per month \ntoward his outstanding state tax debts, currently totaling $7,030, but was in the process of \nsetting up a repayment plan with the IRS for $57,652 in outstanding federal income taxes. \nHe volunteered that he had not yet paid $6,388 in federal income taxes and $633 in state \nincome taxes for tax year 2020. He explained about his tax filing and tax delinquency \nissues that the computer that contained the financial information for his plumbing business \nhad a malfunction in 2014. When it came time to prepare the income tax returns for his \nself-employment as a plumber for TY 2014, he did not have the information needed to \ncomplete his federal and state income tax returns. He continued to neglect his tax filing \nand tax payment obligations for subsequent tax years. He denied any intention to evade \ntaxes and explained that he was in the process of refinancing his mortgage to pay his back \ntaxes with the equity on his home. (GE 2.) \nApplicant knew that he should rectify his tax issues, but he felt overwhelmed by all \nthe paperwork that would be required to file his delinquent returns and was \u201cscared of the \nramifications\u201d for not filing, so he \u201clet it go.\u201d The IRS never sent him any notices inquiring \nabout his unfiled returns, although he feared that he would receive a notice from the IRS. \n(Tr. 43.) He and his girlfriend discussed his failure to file, and eventually the pressure he \nfelt adversely affected his relationship with his cohabitant girlfriend to where she decided \non her own in November 2020 to take steps to address his tax issues. They restarted \nQuickBooks and re-enter all the information for the previous six years, and she took his \npaperwork to his accountant on her own. (Tr. 17-19, 30-32, 43-45.) Applicant had used this \naccountant to file his taxes for tax years prior to 2014. (Tr. 31.) During the six consecutive \nyears that he disregarded his known obligation to file returns, he did not set aside any \nmoney for taxes. (Tr. 38.) \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant indicated on September 29, 2021, \nthat he was currently working with the state and the IRS to satisfy his back taxes and \npenalties. He related that he submitted a large lump-sum payment to the IRS and was in \nrepayment plans with both the state and the IRS. (GE 2.) In response to a request from \nDOHA for details about his tax payments, Applicant explained that he obtained $38,000 \nfrom his mother and made lump-sum payments to the IRS of $21,045; $12,313; $3,195; \n$2,100; and $76.

For the state taxes, he submitted evidence of his $748 monthly \npayments between April 15, 2021, and September 7, 2021. He estimated that his state \ntaxes would be paid off within the next five months. (GE 3.) Applicant obtained the $38,000 \nfrom his mother because he had to make a large lump-sum payment to the IRS before he \ncould get on a repayment plan for his delinquent federal income taxes. His tax returns had \nbeen filed, but the IRS was threatening to file a lien on his house. (Tr. 21, 46.) \nA current payment record from the IRS shows that Applicant made a payment of \n$2,100 to the IRS on August 26, 2021, and monthly payments of $965 from November \n2021 through June 2022. All of these tax payments were applied to his tax liability for TY \n2016. Additionally, he made a $8,899 payment on April 30, 2022, with his return for TY \n2021. (AE A.) He obtained the funds for that payment from an old retirement account that \nhe had for about 20 years that he had not contributed to. (Tr. 37.) He testified that his state \ntax liability was settled on his final payment of approximately $2,500, which was a reduced \nbalance from the amount remaining. (Tr. 20, 35.) He estimates that he owes about $43,000 \nto $44,000 in federal income taxes as of June 2022. (Tr. 20-21.) \nApplicant understands that he made a \u201cpoor choice\u201d in failing to timely file his \nincome tax returns and pay his taxes. (Tr. 15, 29.) He is able to meet his current financial \nobligations, although he does not have any savings and has been taking on extra jobs to \nensure that he has the funds to make his federal income tax payments. He has checking \ndeposits totaling $5,000. (Tr. 39-41.) His cohabitant girlfriend contributes to the household \nincome. (Tr. 26.) Applicant\u2019s monthly expenses include $1,700 for his mortgage loan \n(balance $167,000); $250 for cable services; $500 for a van loan (balance $10,000); $100 \nfor electricity; and an average of $100 for heating. (Tr. 22-23.) His home is currently valued \nat $420,000. He intends to refinance the mortgage on his home or obtain a home-equity \nloan to give him the funds to pay off his federal income tax debts. (Tr. 23, 41.) He tried to \nrefinance last year but his income was not enough to qualify for the loan. (Tr. 39.) If \ngranted a security clearance, he will earn about $25.50 an hour with the defense \ncontractor. (Tr. 24.) In May 2022, Applicant learned that there are open positions for which \nhe may be qualified that do not require a security clearance. He has not pursued any of \nthose opportunities while a decision on his security clearance eligibility is pending. (Tr. 29.) \n Character Reference \nA close friend of Applicant\u2019s for about 30 years testified that Applicant is reputed \namong their community to be of strong character, a hard worker, and always willing to help \nothers. This friend, who works as a federal probation officer, became aware of Applicant\u2019s \ntax issues when Applicant applied to work for the defense contractor as he helped \nApplicant with his application for employment. They had discussed taxes previously over \nthe years, but primarily it was about the challenges Applicant had with managing his \nrecords as a small business owner. This friend does not consider Applicant a security risk \nas Applicant is working hard to rectify his tax situation.

Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nApplicant did not file his federal and state income tax returns when they were due \nfor TYs 2014 through 2019. Section 6012 of the United States Code requires the filing of \nan income tax return by the tax deadline if his or her gross income equals or exceeds the \nsum of the exemption amount plus the basis standard deduction applicable to him or her, \nwhether or not a tax refund is expected. While the record does not contain any details \nabout Applicant\u2019s income for the TYs at issue, it may be reasonably inferred from the \nevidence of his significant federal and state tax liabilities for the TYs that he was required \nto file tax returns. \nApplicant may not have intended to evade paying taxes, but the evidence shows \nthat for several consecutive tax years (2014 through 2020) he did not pay the taxes he was \nrequired to pay. He reported on his SF 86 that he owed past-due income taxes of $51,264 \nto the IRS and $7,854 to the state as of April 2021. Either he underestimated the extent of \nhis federal tax liability or his tax calculations did not include penalties and fees, as he \ntestified that his tax debt with the IRS is currently $43,000 to $44,000. This tax balance is \nafter he made lump-sum payments totaling more than $33,300 in July 2021, a $2,100 \npayment in August 2021, and eight payments of $965 each under a repayment plan from \nNovember 2021 through June 2022. Disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or \nfraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual \nfederal, state, or local income tax as required,\u201d clearly applies. Moreover, AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and \n19(c) are also established. Despite not setting aside any money for taxes over the years, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nhe had not managed to accumulate any significant savings. He had to withdraw money \nfrom an old retirement account to pay his taxes for 2021 and had to ask his mother for \n$38,000 to pay the sizeable lump-sum payments to the IRS so he could avoid a tax lien \nand repay his federal tax debts under an installment plan. \nApplicant has the burdens of production and persuasion in establishing sufficient \nmitigation to overcome the financial concerns raised by his noncompliance with such an \nimportant obligation as filing his tax returns and paying his taxes on time. One or more of \nthe following conditions under AG \u00b6 20 may apply in whole or in part: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) cannot reasonably apply, given Applicant\u2019s failure to comply with his \nincome tax-filing and tax-payment obligations for several consecutive years. Although he \nrectified his tax-filing issues before he applied for a security clearance in April 2021, his \nreform is incomplete as he still owes between $43,000 and $44,000 in delinquent federal \nincome taxes. An applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of \nconduct and are considered recent. See, e.g., ISCR 17-03146 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 31, \n2018), citing, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08779 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2017). \nAG \u00b6 20(b) requires that an individual act responsibly under his or her \ncircumstances, and Applicant\u2019s evidence falls considerably short in that regard. The \ncomputer malfunction that led to the loss of the data needed to timely file his returns \nmitigates at most a delay in filing his income tax returns for tax year 2014. Applicant admits \nthat the steps taken in November 2020 to rectify his tax filings \u2014 reinstalling QuickBooks \nand re-entering the information \u2014 could have been done years earlier. His fear of the \npossible repercussions for not filing returns for TY 2014 do not justify or excuse his \nnoncompliance with his tax-filing and tax-payment obligations for TYs 2015 through 2019. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHe admitted that, as the years went on and no action was taken by the IRS, he \u201cjust let it \ngo.\u201d \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), 20(d), and 20(g) have some applicability because Applicant filed his \ndelinquent tax returns and had a repayment plan established for his state taxes before they \nbecame an issue for his security clearance. Applicant made his first payment to the state \non April 15, 2021, a week after he completed his SF 86, and he made monthly payments \nconsistently thereafter until he paid $2,500 to settle the remaining balance. His state tax \ndebt was satisfied before he answered the SOR. Applicant has shown some good faith \nunder AG \u00b6 20(d) and a willingness to resolve his tax debts under AG \u00b6 20(g) by complying \nwith his installment agreement with the IRS. As of June 1, 2022, he had made nine \npayments of $965 each. \nAt the same time, Applicant\u2019s case in mitigation is undermined in one significant \naspect in that his cohabitant girlfriend initiated the action to rectify his tax issues. Applicant \nwas not motivated for years to address his tax issues, and there is no indication that he \nwould have acted to correct his tax situation before it became an issue for his security \nclearance, and perhaps not even then. The difficulty that Applicant had in managing the \nbooks for his business notwithstanding, he had used an accountant previously to file his \ntaxes. His had no reasonable explanation for not seeking professional assistance to correct \nhis tax issues in a timely fashion. While he is not required to fully satisfy his tax debts to be \ngranted security clearance eligibility, under his current repayment plan it will take more than \nthree years to repay some $43,000 to $44,000 in past-due federal taxes. His persistent \ndisregard of his income tax filing and payment obligations is inconsistent with the good \njudgment, trustworthiness, and reliability that is required to hold a security clearance. The \nfinancial considerations security concerns are not fully mitigated at this time. \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Those factors are: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nThe analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some \nof the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nThe Appeal Board has made clear that voluntary compliance with such rules and \nsystems as those pertaining to filing returns and paying taxes is essential for protecting \nclassified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016). It \nis well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). Based on the \nevidence of record, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant \nor continue security clearance eligibility for Applicant at this time. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant attributed his financial problems to his wife losing her job, his son\u2019s medical problems, and helping his family members financially. He also admitted that the financial issues were due to his \u201cbeing a young irresponsible adult at the time, putting off monthly bills just to buy the latest shoe or device that came out.\u201d He did not have enough taxes withheld from his pay, so he owed taxes when it came time to file his tax returns.

The SOR alleges six delinquent debts totaling about \n$53,800 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f), and that Applicant did not file his federal (SOR \u00b6 1.g) and \nstate (SOR \u00b6 1.h) income tax returns when they were due for tax years 2018 and 2019.1 \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his wife losing her job, his son\u2019s \nmedical problems, and helping his family members financially. He also admitted that the \nfinancial issues were due to his \u201cbeing a young irresponsible adult at the time, putting \noff monthly bills just to buy the latest shoe or device that came out.\u201d He did not have \nenough taxes withheld from his pay, so he owed taxes when it came time to file his tax \nreturns. (Item 3, 4; AE A, B) \nApplicant reported his tax issues and financial problems on a Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions (SF 86) that he submitted in March 2020. He discussed the \nsame issues during a background interview in April 2020. He stated that he started \nworking with a debt consolidation service in March 2020. He stated that he was paying \n$200 to $225 per month, and his delinquent debts were being handled by the service. \n(Items 3, 4) \nApplicant retained a tax expert. While he did not submit direct proof that the old \nreturns were filed, he submitted proof that he entered into an installment agreement with \nthe IRS in October 2021 to address taxes owed from 2012 and 2016 through 2019. He \nagreed to pay $150 per month, starting in November 2021, to increase to $365 per \nmonth in November 2022. Applicant stated that the current balance owed to the IRS is \n$25,865. He did not submit any documents about his state taxes. (AE A, B, D) \n1  The SOR did not allege that Applicant owed back taxes. Any matter that was not alleged in the SOR will \nnot be used for disqualification purposes.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including delinquent debts and \nunfiled federal and state income tax returns. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) are \napplicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his wife losing her job, his son\u2019s \nmedical problems, and helping his family members financially. He also admitted that the \nfinancial issues were due to his \u201cbeing a young irresponsible adult at the time, putting \noff monthly bills just to buy the latest shoe or device that came out.\u201d \nWhile he did not submit direct proof that the old income tax returns were filed, he \nsubmitted proof that he entered into an installment agreement with the IRS in October \n2021 to pay $150 per month, starting in November 2021, to increase to $365 per month \nin November 2022 for tax years 2012 and 2016 through 2019. The current balance is \n$25,865. I accept that the federal returns were filed. The state returns were likely also \nfiled. The status of how much if anything is owed to the state is unknown. AG \u00b6 20(g) is \napplicable to the filed income federal income tax returns. I am also extending it to the \nstate income tax returns. However, that does not end the discussion. \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018). This is true even when the returns are eventually filed. \nThe unidentified medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f is mitigated. Applicant admitted owing \nall of the other debts, but later disputed some of them. I did not see sufficient evidence \nto conclude that he is not responsible for the debts. The fact that a debt is not listed on \nthe most recent credit report provides little mitigation. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-\n03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 15, 2015). Applicant provided no documentation that he \nactually paid or is paying any of the SOR debts. The Appeal Board has held that \u201cit is \nreasonable for a Judge to expect applicants to present documentation about the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsatisfaction of specific debts.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 09-07091 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 11, \n2010) (quoting ISCR Case No. 04-10671 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2006)). He indicated that \nhe is working to settle two debts. However, intentions to resolve financial problems in \nthe future are not a substitute for a track record of debt repayment or other responsible \napproaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his \ndebts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Security concerns about \nApplicant\u2019s finances are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nFor Applicant \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant denied all the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 44 years old. She earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2007, a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2010, and a master\u2019s degree in 2012. She served in the military from 1997 until her honorable discharge in 2003. She then served in the Army National Guard Active Reserve from November 2003 until she was honorably discharged in June 2005. She married in 2013 and has two stepchildren, ages 22 and 18. (Item 3) The SOR alleges four delinquent debts (\u00b6 1.a - $21,000; \u00b6 1.b - $16,574; \u00b6 1.c - $11,173; and \u00b6 1.d - $2,500) totaling approximately $51,247. The debts are supported by Applicant\u2019s admissions made in her answer to the SOR and during her January 2019 background interview with a government investigator, a civil judgment filed in August 2021, and credit reports from May 2022 and April 2021.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 1, 2021, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued to Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \nIn an undated answer to the SOR, Applicant elected to have her case decided on \nthe written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s \nfile of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on June 2, 2022.

The Government\u2019s evidence is \nidentified as Items 2 through 8. (Item 1 is the SOR.) Applicant did not provide a response \nto the FORM or object to the Government\u2019s evidence. Items 2 through 8 are admitted into \nevidence. The case was assigned to me on September 15, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant denied all the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 44 years old. She earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2007, a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in 2010, and a master\u2019s degree in 2012. She served in the military from 1997 until \nher honorable discharge in 2003. She then served in the Army National Guard Active \nReserve from November 2003 until she was honorably discharged in June 2005. She \nmarried in 2013 and has two stepchildren, ages 22 and 18. (Item 3) \nThe SOR alleges four delinquent debts (\u00b6 1.a - $21,000; \u00b6 1.b - $16,574; \u00b6 1.c - \n$11,173; and \u00b6 1.d - $2,500) totaling approximately $51,247. The debts are supported by \nApplicant\u2019s admissions made in her answer to the SOR and during her January 2019 \nbackground interview with a government investigator, a civil judgment filed in August \n2021, and credit reports from May 2022 and April 2021. (Items 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8) \nIn Applicant\u2019s January 2019 security clearance application (SCA), she reported \ndelinquent student loans for $37,911; $17,387; and $20,770 and said she was working \nwith the creditor to make monthly payment arrangements. (Item 3) \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in January 2019 and \nattributed her financial difficulties to her husband\u2019s unemployment for 15 months \nbeginning in January 2015, and that they used credit cards for their living expenses and \ngot behind on them and her student loans. At some point, she enrolled in a debt-relief \nprogram (DRP) to settle her outstanding credit card balances. She said she had paid \nsome of the debts on a monthly basis and negotiations were ongoing for one credit card. \n(Item 7) \nApplicant did not dispute the debts that she was confronted with by the investigator \nthat were later alleged in the SOR. She stated that they were being paid through the DRP. \nShe was asked specifically about student loans she reported as delinquent in her SCA \nand confirmed each loan was being repaid through her DRP. In her SOR answer, she \nacknowledged the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a, but disputed the amount she owed. She said she \nreceived a letter from collection attorneys requesting payment for the student loan \nbalance, and she disputed the amount. She is waiting for the attorneys to explain why \nshe owes so much money on the account. Her April 2021 and May 2022 credit reports \nshow the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a is charged off, disputed, and that the resolution process was \nconcluded. Applicant did not provide a response to the FORM updating the status of this \ndebt and it remains unresolved.

She stated that she \nsettled the account in SOR \u00b6 1.b for less than the full amount and had paid down \napproximately half of the debt. She provided payment records that show in March 2021, \nshe agreed to settle the debt for $15,231 on a current balance at the time of $23,432,, \nand was required to make 18 monthly payments of $846. Her payment record shows she \nmade payments from March through November 2021. As noted above, Applicant received \nthe FORM in June 2022 and had an opportunity to provide additional information, but she \ndid not respond and did not provide an updated status of her payments. I am unable to \ndetermine if she continued to make the required monthly payments to resolve the debt. \n(Item 2) \nApplicant affirmed in her answer to the SOR that she is responsible for the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c for a judgment for a student loan. She provided an unsigned copy \nof a consent judgment in her sister\u2019s name, but the civil judgment recorded in August \n2021 in the district court is in Applicant\u2019s name for $23,432. Applicant agreed to settle the \naccount for $14,000. It is unknown why her sister\u2019s name is on the consent judgment. The \ncivil judgment is binding. She stated that she has an installment agreement to pay $800 \na month. She provided documents to show she made payments from April 2021 to \nNovember 2021. She did not provide a response to the FORM updating the status of the \ndebt. I am unable to determine if she continued to make the required monthly payments \nto resolve the debt. (Items 2, 8) \nApplicant stated in her SOR answer that in June 2018 she reached a settlement \nagreement of $851 with the creditor for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d. In January 2020, she \nclosed her account with DRP and took over paying her remaining debts. She said she \npaid this debt, but the creditor did not clear her account. Her most recent credit report \nfrom May 2022 reports the debt as charged off. She did not provide documentation to \nshow the debt has been resolved. (Items 2, 5) \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR answer, she stated that she works a total of 20 hours Monday \nthrough Friday and another 15 to 20 hours on Saturday and Sunday making food \ndeliveries. She said she has an additional $500 at the end of the month after making the \npayments on the debts noted above. (Item 2) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.

According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had four delinquent debts totaling approximately $51,247 that she was \nunable to pay. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the\nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit\ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control;  \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant attributed her financial problems to her husband\u2019s 15 months of \nunemployment beginning in approximately January 2015, more than seven years ago. \nThis condition was beyond her control. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant \nmust have acted responsibly under the circumstances. She had numerous delinquent \ndebts that she disclosed on her SCA and resolved some of them through her agreement \nwith DRP. The SOR alleged those that were not resolved. Applicant stated in her answer \nto the SOR that she had payment agreements for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c and \nprovided proof of her payments. The Government\u2019s FORM put Applicant on notice that \nfurther documentation was required. She did not provide evidence that she continued to \nmake the required payments. I have considered that she has made some payments, but \nwithout additional evidence, I cannot conclude that she has adhered to a good-faith effort \nto repay the creditor. I find AG \u00b6 20(b) has some application. I find AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to \nthe extent that Applicant made some payments on the debts. Although there is some \nmitigation, without additional evidence, these debts are unmitigated. \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d is reported as charged-off on Applicant\u2019s April 2021 and \nMay 2022 credit reports. There is no documentary evidence to support it was paid. There \nis no evidence that Applicant has participated in financial counseling. AG \u00b6 20(c) does \nnot apply. \nApplicant had numerous delinquent student loans and it appears she paid some \nof them. The collection attorneys for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a noted that the debt is a \ndelinquent student loan. Applicant stated that she is waiting for the collection attorneys to \nexplain why the balance of the loan is so high. Her dispute is reported on her credit report \nand says that the resolution process is concluded. Without additional evidence on what \naction she has taken to resolve the issue, I am unable to apply the mitigating condition \nunder AG \u00b6 20(e) to this debt. Applicant did not provide an update as to the status of her \ndispute beyond what she stated in her answer to the SOR. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline, F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has not met her burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He has worked for \nhis current employer since December 2020. He is applying for a security clearance for \nthe first time. He has an associate degree and additional college credits, but no \nbachelor\u2019s degree. He is single without children. (Items 2, 3) \nApplicant has a history of substance abuse. He started using marijuana in about \n2006. He was issued citations for possession of marijuana in 2006 and 2010.

(Items 1-3) \nApplicant was prescribed opioid medication for the pain. After consulting with his \npain-management doctor, he decided that marijuana was a better alternative than \nopioids. In March 2020, he resumed using marijuana, but only for medicinal purposes. \nHe purchased the marijuana about once a month. (Items 1-3) \nApplicant reported his alcohol issues and his marijuana use on a Questionnaire \nfor National Security Positions (SF 86) he submitted in January 2021. He stated that he \nintended to use marijuana in the future with the comment: \u201cI use this for medical \nreasons. As suggested by my Doctors. It provides a level of relief that could only be \nachieved by heavy narcotic and opioid medication.\u201d (Item 2) \nApplicant provided similar information when he was interviewed for his \nbackground investigation in March 2021 and in his response to interrogatories in \nOctober 2021, in which he wrote: \nMy use of medical cannabis/marijuana has been a vital tool in my journey \nof recovery and has helped me become the best me I have ever been. In \naddition to the fact that it helped me stop taking heavy doses of opioids \nalmost immediately, its use helps me with pain relief, gastric \nstress/problems relief, sleep issues, and it works in conjunction with my \nanxiety medication for anxiety relief. If permitted, I would like to continue to \nuse medical cannabis.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nApplicant admittedly was a heavy drinker up through October 2019. He was \narrested for DWI in 2012. The above disqualifying conditions are applicable. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c allege Applicant\u2019s hospitalization \u201cfor medial issues due, at \nleast in part, to [his] excessive alcohol consumption.\u201d SOR \u00b6 2.b also alleges that he \ncontinued to drink excessively after the hospitalization. The gravamen of these \nallegations is not the hospitalizations, it is the excessive drinking before and after the \nhospitalizations. The excessive drinking is already alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a. When the \nsame conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one or more of the \nduplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03\u00ad\n04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005). SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c are concluded for Applicant. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant has not had a drink since October 2019, and his health prevents him \nfrom drinking. I find evidence of successful rehabilitation, and that alcohol consumption \ndoes not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAlcohol consumption security concerns are mitigated. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant possessed and used marijuana from 2006 to 2010. He resumed using \nmarijuana for pain-management purposes in March 2020. Marijuana, including medical \nmarijuana, remains a controlled substance and illegal under federal law. He stated \nmultiple times that he intended to use marijuana for medicinal purposes in the future. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(g) are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use from 2006 to 2010 is mitigated. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e \nare concluded for Applicant. \nApplicant wrote that he would continue to use medical marijuana, \u201cas it is legal in \n[his] state to do so.\u201d Applicant did not violate any state law when he possessed and \nused marijuana for medicinal purposes. I believe Applicant has been completely truthful \nand forthcoming, and his position has become increasingly common and accepted. \nHowever, marijuana possession is still a federal crime, and inconsistent with holding a \nsecurity clearance. None of the mitigating conditions are applicable, and Applicant\u2019s \nillegal drug use is not mitigated. Additionally, as an unlawful user of a controlled \nsubstance, he is precluded from holding a security clearance by the Bond Amendment.1 \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n1 IRTPA of 2004 \u00a7 3002, 50 USC \u00a7 3343; and Appendix B of the adjudicative guidelines (Bond \nAmendment Guidance). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines G and H in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the Guideline G (alcohol consumption) security concerns, but he did not \nmitigate the security concerns under Guideline H (drug involvement and substance \nmisuse). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.e: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 59-year-old employee of a government contractor. He has worked for his current employer or a subcontractor thereof since about 2017. He was awarded a high school diploma in 1981, and has taken some online college courses without earning an additional degree. He was married from 1983 until a divorce in 1996.

He has worked \nfor his current employer or a subcontractor thereof since about 2017. He was awarded a \nhigh school diploma in 1981, and has taken some online college courses without \nearning an additional degree. He was married from 1983 until a divorce in 1996. He \nremarried his ex-spouse in 2019. He has two adult children. He served in the U.S. Army \nfrom 1981 until 2001, when he received an honorable discharge. He has been working \nfor government contractors since he retired from the military. (Tr. 18, 21-24; GE 1, 3; AE \nA) \nIn March 2014, Applicant was arrested and charged with operating a vehicle \nwhile intoxicated (OVWI). On the night of his arrest, he claimed that he was in a hotel as \nhe was traveling for work. He claimed that he had taken NyQuil because he wasn\u2019t \nfeeling well. He claimed that his co-workers had gone to a bar and needed to be picked \nup, so he drove from the hotel to a bar to pick them up. He claimed that he could not \nfind his friends at the bar, so he drove back to the hotel where he was staying. As he \npulled into the hotel, he was stopped by a police officer who told him he had been \nswerving while driving. He claimed that he explained to the police officer that he had \ntaken cold medicine and had not been drinking, but the police officer arrested him on \nsuspicion of OVWI because he had been swerving and because the police officer \nsmelled alcohol on his breath. At the police station, Applicant was administered a \nbreathalyzer that indicated (at least) the presence of alcohol. Based upon the totality of \nthe evidence, including an analysis of Applicant\u2019s credibility, Applicant was driving while \nimpaired by alcohol. (Tr. 24-32, 34-39; Answer; GE 3, 5) \nApplicant failed to appear in court for his hearing regarding his 2014 OVWI. He \nclaimed that, prior to his hearing date, he contacted the court to let them know that he \nwould be out of the country for work on his hearing date, and that he provided the court \nthe information they requested to justify his absence. Regardless, in February 2015, the \ncourt found that he failed to appear and issued a warrant for his arrest. Applicant \nclaimed that when he got back from being out of the country for work, he contacted the \ncourt and the court told him that he did not need to take any further action regarding his \n2014 OVWI arrest or his failure to appear. He claimed that he has e-mails to this effect \nbut he did not present them as evidence. (Tr. 20, 46-47; Answer; GE 3, 5) \nIn 2017, Applicant learned from two different sources that he still had a warrant \nout for his arrest for failure to appear on his 2014 OVWI. One source was the \ngovernment contractor that conducted his November 2017 security interview. The other \nsource was a security police officer at a military base who pulled Applicant over for \nexpired tags. During his November 2017 security interview, he told the government \ncontractor that he would resolve the outstanding warrant. He claimed that he contacted \nthe court via telephone, paid a fine, and believed that he had resolved the failure to \nappear. He provided no documentary evidence to corroborate any resolution of his \nfailure to appear in 2017. He also claimed in his testimony and Answer that he did not \nfind out about his failure to appear until 2020 or 2021. When asked about the \ndiscrepancies in his Answer and testimony, he was evasive.

His \nevasiveness and inconsistent representations regarding his discovery of his failure to \nappear undermine his credibility. (Tr. 20, 46-52; GE 3, 5) \nIn 2020, Applicant claimed that, during another security interview, he learned that \nthe warrant for his failure to appear was still outstanding. He hired an attorney. On July \n13, 2021, he entered a plea agreement whereby he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor of \noperating a vehicle with a blood alcohol content of .08 or greater. Pursuant to his plea \nagreement, he was sentenced to time served (2 days) and ordered to pay court costs \nand fees. He was not placed on probation and his license was not suspended. This plea \nagreement resolved the issue of his failure to appear. While technically breaking the \nlaw, given his efforts to resolve his failure to appear, he was not knowingly engaging in \ncriminal behavior while this charge was outstanding. (Tr. 20, 47-50; Answer; GE 3, 5) \nApplicant was arrested in 1996 for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) \nwhile operating a vehicle on a military base. He failed a field sobriety test and, after \ntaking a breathalyzer test, his blood alcohol content was over the legal limit. In 1997, he \npleaded guilty in federal district court to a lesser charge of negligent driving in the first \ndegree. (Tr. 22, 35; GE 3, 4) \nState A entered a tax lien against Applicant in 2011 for $912 for unpaid taxes. \nApplicant claimed that he paid this tax lien in 2018, but he did not provide \ndocumentation to corroborate that this lien has been satisfied. During his 2017 security \ninterview, he denied the existence of this lien, but admitted it in his Answer. He claimed \nthat he fell behind on his taxes to State A because he was not making enough money to \nmake ends meet and he was not paying attention. He was also not having enough \nmoney in taxes withheld from his income. (Tr. 19-20, 37-39, 42; Answer; GE 3, 6) \nApplicant failed to timely pay his federal taxes for the 2008, 2009, 2013, 2015, \nand 2016 tax years. He claimed that he made a payment arrangement with the IRS in \n2017 to pay $600 per month towards his $7,600 federal tax debt. He provided \ndocuments from the IRS corroborating that he made $600 monthly payments from June \n2017 until April 2018, and a $3,423 payment in May 2018. He paid these delinquent \nfederal taxes in full in May 2018. Applicant claimed that his federal taxes were \ndelinquent because he was not paying attention and was not withholding enough money \nin taxes from his income. He claimed that he has changed his withholdings so that he \ndoes not owe taxes at the end of the tax year. Applicant did not timely file his 2012, \n2013, and 2015 federal income tax returns. He filed his delinquent federal income tax \nreturns in May 2017. Any adverse information not alleged in the SOR, such as \nApplicant\u2019s failure to timely file federal income tax returns and his 1996 DUI, cannot be \nused for disqualification purposes. It may be considered when assessing the application \nof mitigating conditions and for the whole-person analysis. (Tr. 19-20, 37-38, 43-44; \nAnswer; GE 3, 7) \nDespite being required to do so, Applicant failed to report his 2014 arrest for \nOVWI on the Questionnaire for National Security Positions he submitted in May 2017 \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(2017 SF 86) and April 2020 (2020 SF 86). His failure to report the OVWI in the 2020 \nSF 86 came after a DOD investigator confronted him with the arrest during his 2017 \nclearance interview. He also lied to a DOD investigator during his 2020 security \ninterview when he claimed that he had not been arrested in 2014 on an alcohol charge. \nDuring his April 2021 security interview, he lied to a DOD investigator when he denied \never having been arrested on any other alcohol-related charges despite having also \nbeen arrested in 1996. His explanations for why he failed to report the relevant arrests \non his 2017 and 2020 SF 86 and during his 2020 and 2021 security interviews were \nvaried and inconsistent. Applicant\u2019s explanations included forgetting about the arrests, \nnot understanding the question as provided in the clearance applications, being \nconfused, and claiming that it was actually his cousin with a similar name and Social \nSecurity number who had been arrested. These inconsistent representations undermine \nApplicant\u2019s credibility and strain credulity. (Tr. 23-24, 28-32, 34-39; Answer; GE 1-3) \nDespite being required to do so, Applicant failed to report his state and federal \ntax delinquencies on his 2017 SF 86 and 2020 SF 86. He claimed that he made a \nmistake when he failed to report these tax delinquencies on his 2017 SF 86. He claimed \nthat he did not report these tax delinquencies on his 2020 SF 86 because he thought he \ndid not have to because he had paid his delinquent taxes. (Tr. 32-34; Answer; GE 1-3, \n6, 7) \nApplicant has filled out approximately 10 security clearance applications \nthroughout his career, so he is not new to the process. Given his lack of credibility \nbased upon his evasiveness and inconsistent and unbelievable explanations, as well as \nhis failure to divulge the required information, he deliberately failed to disclose his 2014 \nOVWI arrest on his 2017 SF 86 and his 2020 SF 86. He also lied to a DOD investigator \nregarding this arrest and his 1996 DUI arrest. For the foregoing reasons, he also \ndeliberately failed to disclose his state and federal tax delinquencies on his 2017 SF 86 \nand his 2020 SF 86. He did admit his federal and state tax delinquencies during his \n2017 security interviews before being confronted. (Tr. 32-34, 45-52; Answer; GE 1-7) \nApplicant provided character reference letters from two of his supervisors. Both \nclaim that Applicant needs his security clearance to perform his job and recommend \nthat he be awarded one. They note that he is a hard worker and has not had any \nsecurity related incidents. (AE A, B) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying.

The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment;  \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nIt has been eight years since Applicant last drove while impaired by alcohol. \nWhile his failure to appear on his 2014 OVWI was not fully resolved until 2021, I give \nApplicant some credit for his unsuccessful efforts to resolve it prior to then. I also \nacknowledge that he believed the failure to appear had been resolved on multiple \noccasions. I therefore do not believe that he knowingly engaged in criminal behavior \nwith respect to his failure to appear. The significant amount of time that has elapsed \nsince he has knowingly engaged in criminal behavior is persuasive evidence of \nsuccessful rehabilitation, that the criminal behavior is unlikely to recur, and that it no \nlonger casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. The criminal \nconduct security concern is mitigated. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to pay his federal and state taxes. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise the above disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant became delinquent on federal and State A taxes because he was not \npaying attention and did not withhold sufficient taxes from his income. These conditions \nwere within his control. Failure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a \nproblem with abiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with rules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd.

A person who fails \nrepeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying \ntaxes when due, does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability \nrequired of those granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-\n01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018).  \nApplicant has provided sufficient evidence that he paid his delinquent federal \ntaxes prior to the issuance of the SOR. However, he has not provided sufficient \nevidence that he satisfied the State A tax lien or made arrangements with the tax \nauthority for State A to do so. He claimed that he paid this tax lien, but he provided no \ndocumentary corroboration that he has done so. It is reasonable to expect Applicant to \npresent documentation about the resolution of specific debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2016). \nWhile AG \u00b6 20(g) is applicable to Applicant\u2019s delinquent federal taxes, none of \nthe mitigating factors are applicable with respect to Applicant\u2019s tax lien with State A. The \nfinancial considerations security concern is not mitigated. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative; and \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThe Government cross-alleged Applicant\u2019s OVWI, his failure to appear, and his \nguilty plea under Guideline E. As it was mitigated, this behavior was insufficient for an \nadverse determination under Guideline J. However, that behavior may support a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of \ncandor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics \nindicating that the individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 16(c). \nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose his 2014 alcohol-related arrest on \nmultiple security clearance applications despite being required to do so. He lied to a \nDOD investigator about this arrest. He lied to a DOD investigator about his 1996 \nalcohol-related arrest. He also deliberately failed to disclose his delinquent tax debts on \nmultiple security clearance applications despite being required to do so. He has filled \nout about 10 security clearance applications in the past, so his claims of being confused \nor misunderstanding the questions ring hollow. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n16(a) and 16(b). \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply in Applicant\u2019s case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) applies to Applicant\u2019s OVWI, his failure to appear, and his guilty plea \nthat the Government cross-alleged, because of the passage of time without recurrence \nas indicated in the analysis of AG \u00b6 32(a) under Guideline J. I find in favor of Applicant \nwith respect to SOR \u00b6 3(a). \nAG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply to Applicant\u2019s intentional failure to disclose his \nalcohol-related arrests on his security clearance applications or his lies about these \narrests to DOD investigators. Applicant did not volunteer this information until he was \nconfronted and lied about his actions after being confronted. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) applies to Applicant\u2019s intentional failure to disclose his tax \ndelinquencies on his 2017 SCA because he volunteered that information to the DOD \ninvestigator during his 2017 security interview prior to being confronted with those facts. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply to Applicant\u2019s intentional failure to disclose his tax \ndelinquencies on his 2020 SCA because there is insufficient evidence to show that he \nvolunteered this information prior to being confronted. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply to Applicant\u2019s intentional security clearance \napplication falsifications or his lies to DOD investigators. Falsification of an SF 86 is not \n\u201cminor\u201d because it \u201cstrikes at the heart of the security clearance process.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 09-01652 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2011). Applicant has repeatedly failed to divulge \nrequired information and lied to DOD investigators. At the hearing, Applicant was \nevasive and inconsistent in his testimony. His dishonesty and lack of candor are \nfrequent and are not unlikely to recur. His behavior leaves me with serious concerns \nabout his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Personal conduct security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have considered \nApplicant\u2019s military service and his character references, and I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines J, F, and E in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F: \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 3.b-3.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 3.e-3.f: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

She is married and has three children; an adult child; and two minor children from the marriage.

At this point, there is no record \nevidence of further activity or action by the tax-relief firm on behalf of Applicant and her \nspouse. The back taxes of approximately $146,733, and the associated federal tax \nliens, are unresolved. \nIn addition to the back taxes, the SOR alleged an unpaid judgment for $3,632, \nwhich was filed against Applicant in 2020. She admitted the unpaid judgment in her \nanswer to the SOR. In addition to her admission, the unpaid judgment is established by \ncredit reports and court records. (Exhibits 6, 7, and 8) The judgment stems from a credit \ncard account that went into collection. She explained during the background \ninvestigation that she stopped paying the credit card account because she felt that she \ncould not make progress in reducing the balance due to a high interest rate. (Exhibit 5) \nShe also expressed an intention to settle the account with the judgment creditor. At this \npoint, this is no record evidence that the account was settled or otherwise resolved. \nThe SOR also alleged four charged-off student loans in the total amount of \napproximately $86,000. She admitted the four charged-off student loans in her answer \nto the SOR. In addition to her admissions, the loans are established by credit reports. \n(Exhibits 6 and 7) She explained during the background investigation she cosigned the \nloans for her eldest daughter. (Exhibit 5) The loans became delinquent when her \ndaughter stopped making the required payments, and Applicant did not wish to make \nthe loan payments. She further stated she intends to satisfy the student loans via a \npayment plan that had yet to be established and estimated completion of the plan by \n2028. She did not provide documentation to establish a repayment plan for the loans. \nIn summary, Applicant did not provide documentary proof that she has made \narrangements with the IRS to pay the substantial amount owed and is in compliance \nwith those arrangements. Likewise, she did not provide documentary proof that the \nunpaid judgment and four charged-off student loans were paid, settled, in a repayment \nagreement, disputed, cancelled, forgiven, or otherwise resolved. \nLaw and Policies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v.

In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s \nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.4 Substantial \nevidence means \u201cevidence that a reasonable mind could accept as adequate to support \na conclusion; evidence beyond a scintilla.\u201d5 Substantial evidence is a lesser burden than \nboth clear and convincing evidence and preponderance of the evidence, the latter of \nwhich is the standard applied in most civil trials. It is also a far lesser burden than \nevidence beyond a reasonable doubt, the norm for criminal trials. \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.6 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.7 \nDiscussion \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . .. \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd.

It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) an inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \nAG \u00b6 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income \ntax as required; \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The disqualifying \nconditions noted above apply here. \nIn addressing the main issue of this case, I note that an applicant\u2019s failure to \ntimely file tax returns or pay tax when due (or both) bears close examination and is a \nmatter of serious concern to the federal government. The DOHA Appeal Board has \nmade it clear that an applicant who fails repeatedly to fulfill their legal obligations, such \nas filing tax returns or paying tax when due, does not demonstrate the high degree of \ngood judgment and reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee ISCR Case No. 15-06707 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 15, 2017). \nTo her credit, Applicant disclosed her income-tax problems in her security \nclearance application, and she provided information during the background \ninvestigation. But the evidence does not support a conclusion that she has engaged in \nsufficient remedial efforts. The documentary evidence (Exhibit A) shows she and her \nspouse have merely taken the initial first step toward rehabilitation, but they have miles \nto go before they reach the destination of compliance with the IRS. The other delinquent \ndebts are also unresolved, and there are not realistic plans in place to resolve them. \nNearly $150,000 in back taxes owed to the IRS is a serious matter. The other \ndelinquent debts are considered to be evidence in aggravation. Based on the evidence, \nthe mitigating conditions noted above do not apply here. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns\nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that she \nhas not met her ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.n:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

On November 5, 2021, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to \nApplicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse). (Item 1.) The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, effective within the Department of \nDefense on June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on November 23, 2021, and \nrequested his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. (Item 1.) In his \nAnswer Applicant admitted both allegations in the SOR. On January 18, 2022, \nDepartment Counsel submitted the Department\u2019s written case. A complete copy of the \nfile of relevant material (FORM), consisting of Items 1 to 3, was provided to Applicant, \nwho received the file on January 28, 2022. \nApplicant was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant elected not to submit any \nadditional information. \nDepartment Counsel submitted three Items in support of the SOR \nallegations. Item 3 is inadmissible. It will not be considered or cited as evidence against \nApplicant\u2019s interests in this case. It is the summary of an unsworn interview of Applicant \nconducted by an interviewer from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on March \n8, 2021. Applicant did not adopt it as his own statement, or otherwise certify it to be \naccurate. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20, this Report of Investigation summary is \ninadmissible against Applicant\u2019s interests in the absence of an authenticating witness. \nSee Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 5. In light of Applicant\u2019s admissions, Item 3 is also \ncumulative. I therefor reviewed it for any potentially mitigating information that Applicant \nmight have thought would be considered. No mitigating information was found in Item 3 \nthat was not available from other sources in the record, and which was accordingly \nconsidered. \nThe case was assigned to me on April 6, 2022. Based upon a review of the \npleadings and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor, where he works as a \nsenior customer operations engineer. He has a Bachelor\u2019s degree. Applicant is not \nmarried and has no children. He is seeking to obtain national security eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance in connection with his employment in the Defense industry. \n(Government Exhibit 1 at Sections12, 13A, and 17.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \ndue to his use of illegal drugs.

(Item 3.) There is no information in the record, including Item \n3, to show that Applicant has stopped all marijuana use. \nApplicant stated in Section 23 of the e-QIP in answer to a question about the \nnature, frequency and number of times he used marijuana (Item 2): \nUsage has been for the purposes of mitigating health issue impacting \nquality of life such as insomnia, loss of appetite, anxiety, as well as for use \nrecreationally. Use has also assisted with side effects of medication \n(vyvanse) used for treating ADHD. \nA different part of Section 23 asked Applicant to explain why he intended, or did \nnot intend, to use marijuana in the future: \nMy plan is to use the remaining portion of the year [2020] to substitute the \nbenefits for holistic options such as tea, yoga, meditation, proper eating \nhabits, and exercise. The goal is to ensure quality of life, mental health, and \nmaintain appetite while reducing stress. I select \u2018Yes\u2019 because I intend to \nsubmit this form before the end of November 2020. \nFinally, Applicant was asked in a different part of Section 23 if he intended to \nengage in marijuana use in the future. Applicant stated, \u201cNo.\u201d As stated, Applicant \ncontinued to use marijuana until March 2021, if not later. \n1.b. Applicant admitted on his e-QIP that he purchased marijuana for consumption \nabout every 3 to 4 months. He stated that he engaged in this activity because, \u201cUse of \nsubstance provides a higher quality of life and address the widest range of stressors.\u201d \n(Item 2 at Section 23.)  \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept.

AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe security concern relating to Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse is set \nforth in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted \nin this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nI have examined the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 and especially \nconsidered the following: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant has a history of using illegal drugs. He has used marijuana on a regular \nbasis since 2005 through at least March 2021, after stating in his November 2020 e-QIP \nthat he intended to stop. Applicant stated that he intended to continue to use marijuana \nsince its use had helped him manage stress and anxiety. He had also purchased \nmarijuana many times over the years. All three of the disqualifying conditions apply, \nthereby transferring the burden to Applicant to mitigate them. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 have also been considered: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug-involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant admitted his long-term use of marijuana, his repeated purchases of \nmarijuana, and his intent to continue its use until some unknown time in the future.

Applicant has not met his burden of \npersuasion to mitigate the security concerns arising from his lengthy history of drug \ninvolvement at this time. This allegation is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns resulting from his long-term drug involvement. Overall, the record \nevidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national \nsecurity eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

The guidelines cited in the SOR were among the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) issued by the Director of National Intelligence on December \n10, 2016, to be effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) on November 10, 2021, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. I received the case on April 8, 2022, \nand convened a hearing on June 28, 2022. The parties appeared as scheduled, and I \nreceived a transcript of the hearing on July 8, 2022. \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel proffered Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 5. \nAdditionally, a copy of a discovery letter dated January 13, 2020, and a list of the \nGovernment\u2019s exhibits are included in the record as Hearing Exhibits (HX) 1 and 2, \nrespectively.

Without \nobjection from Applicant, I excluded AX K, a copy of Applicant\u2019s signed receipt of the \nNotice of Hearing, which had no substantive bearing on his case. I admitted all of both \nparties\u2019 remaining exhibits without objection. (Tr. 15 \u2013 31) \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $17,234 for six \ndelinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.f). SOR 1.f alleges a $16,264 debt (or about \n94 percent of the total debt at issue) for the delinquent remainder after resale from a \nvehicle repossession.

He estimates that at one point, he owed \nbetween $250,000 and $300,000 in unpaid debts. His first application for a security \nclearance was denied in July 2011, because of security concerns about his finances \nalleged in a Letter of Intent to Deny Security Clearance and an enclosed SOR, dated \nJune 1, 2009. However, he stated in his e-QIP that in October 2011, he received a \nclearance after reconsideration of the decision to deny his application. Applicant was able \nto resolve some of the debts listed in that SOR, but he acknowledges many of them simply \naged off his credit history. None of those debts appears on either of the credit reports \nsubmitted by the Government in this case and the SOR did not allege any of these debts. \n(GX 1 \u2013 GX 5; Tr. 33, 44 \u2013 46) \nApplicant asserts that the delinquent debts he carried when he joined the Army \nwere the result of his wife\u2019s inability to work when she became ill in 2002. In 2009, his \nwife\u2019s cancer returned and she again could not work. This caused further financial \ndifficulties as they tried to resolve the debts alleged in the 2009 SOR and still make ends \nmeet on a junior enlisted salary. The debts listed in the 2009 SOR consisted of 26 unpaid \nmedical debts presumably associated with his wife\u2019s cancer treatment in 2002. Those \ndebts totaled about $7,844, and one of them was the subject of a civil judgment against \nhim. At the time of his wife\u2019s 2002 cancer diagnosis, he had medical insurance through \nhis construction job that covered about two-thirds of his wife\u2019s medical expenses. In the \nArmy, he and his family also had medical insurance that would have covered most of her \ncancer treatment. The 2009 SOR also listed other non-medical debts, including a $10,000 \ntax lien, two car repossessions, two civil judgments against him, and 12 other delinquent \ndebts, all of which totaled about $34,850. (Answer; GX 2; GX 5; AX G \u2013 I; Tr. 42, 46 \u2013 49) \nIn March 2018, Applicant\u2019s wife was diagnosed a third time with the same type of \ncancer. This time, she underwent a procedure that her physicians previously had chosen \nnot to perform. The procedure in 2018, according to Applicant, resulted in a successful \neradication of her cancer. He and his wife are optimistic that the cancer will not return. \nAgain, Applicant had medical insurance for his family provided as part of his military \nservice. Because of this latest bout with cancer, Applicant\u2019s wife again was unemployed, \nthis time for about nine months. She returned to work in early 2019; however, later that \nyear, Applicant was medically retired from the Army and found himself unemployed. They \nlived on his wife\u2019s net monthly income of about $2,000 and Applicant\u2019s VA disability of \nabout $2,800 a month until he started his current job in September 2020. At that time, he \nearned an annual salary of about $72,000. After a pay raise in April 2022, he now makes \nabout $92,500 and his total household income is about $150,000 before taxes and other \ndeductions.

In response to the SOR, he \nprovided information showing that, ten days after the date of the SOR, he paid or \notherwise resolved the debts at SOR 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c. At hearing, he testified that the \nstatement that he was unaware of his debts until he received the SOR was the result of \nhelp he received from a fellow employee in drafting his Answer. However, he \nacknowledged that he was, indeed, aware of his debts as early as December 2020. \n(Answer; GX 1 \u2013 4; AX A \u2013 C; AX F; Tr. 33) \nThe $16,264 debt at SOR 1.d is still unpaid. It represents the remainder after resale \nof a pickup truck Applicant purchased for $37,948 in October 2017. Starting in January \n2018, he was two months behind on his loan payments. By September 2018, he was five \nmonths behind on his $700-a-month payments and decided to have the truck voluntarily \nrepossessed. Applicant attributed his difficulty in staying current on that loan to the fact \nthat his wife again developed cancer in early 2018 and they did not have her income while \nshe underwent treatment. After resale of the vehicle, he still owed the amount alleged at \nSOR 1.d. During his December 2020 PSI, Applicant stated that he was in negotiations \nwith the creditor to repay that amount over four years. In response to the SOR, he stated \nthat in November 2021, the creditor offered to settle this debt for $9,546 over 12 months, \nor $795 each month. At hearing, he testified the creditor offered to settle the debt for 12 \nmonthly payments of $940, which would total of $11,280. His position at hearing was that \nhe could not afford to pay that amount. This debt remains unresolved. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 \n4; AX G \u2013 I; Tr.) \nApplicant did not provide any corroborating documentation about the SOR 1.d \ncreditor\u2019s settlement offer to resolve the apparent discrepancy between the settlement \nterms described in his Answer and those described at hearing. He also did not provide \nany detailed information about his current finances, such as a monthly budget or other \npersonal financial statement that might shed better light on his ability to pay this debt. \nFurther, he did not present any information about what, if any, adjustments he and his \nwife made to their expenses during her periods of unemployment or after his medical \nretirement. Applicant has not sought or obtained any professional financial counseling or \nassistance in resolving his remaining debt or improving the way he and his wife manage \ntheir finances. \nIn June 2020, while he was still unemployed, Applicant purchased a motorcycle \nfor $10,273. He sold it in early 2022 for a price that enabled him to satisfy the remaining \n$9,269 due on the loan as well as realize about $1,500 in profit. In November 2020, after \nhe began his current job, he purchased a new pickup truck for $69,500 to replace a used \nvehicle he had been driving. Not long thereafter, he was in an accident and, in May 2021, \nhe purchased another vehicle for $46,797. He did so with an understanding from the \ndealer that in six months, he could trade that vehicle for the same model pickup truck as \nhe bought in November 2020, but on better terms. In November 2021, he tried to avail \nhimself of the dealer\u2019s offer. Instead, he claims he could not obtain a loan on a less \nexpensive truck and wound up buying a new model pickup truck for $66,141. His high \nmonthly payment includes the balance due on the May 2021 vehicle.

He subsequently resolved the debt through four payments made in \nNovember and December 2021. The record is unclear as to the origin of this debt. \nApplicant claims the bills for this debt went to his mother\u2019s house, which was his military \nhome of record, even though Applicant has not lived there since he and his wife got \nmarried in 2002. As to his overall knowledge of his various debts, he testified that he \nchecked his credit report when he completed his e-QIP in September 2020. According to \nthe October 2020 credit report introduced by the Government, SOR 1.d had been \ndelinquent since October 2017. I did not find his explanation about his awareness of this \ndebt to be credible and I find as fact that he knew about this debt well before he received \nthe SOR. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 4; AX F \u2013 I; Tr. 36) \nAt hearing, Applicant provided a character reference from his supervisor of the \npast two years. According to the author, Applicant has performed exceptionally well \nduring his tenure with the company. He is well-regarded in the workplace, and he is \nknowledgeable, reliable and professional in the performance of his duties. (AX J) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Government presented sufficient information to support the SOR allegations \nthat Applicant accrued significant past-due or delinquent debt, the single largest of which \nconstituted about 94 percent of the debt at issue and was still outstanding as of the \nhearing. This information reasonably raises a security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances \nthat is articulated at AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAvailable information also requires consideration of the following pertinent AG \u00b6 \n20 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s financial problems are recent and \nmultiple. His debt from a 2018 repossession is still not resolved. His other debts arose \nwithin the past four or five years, and he only resolved them after receiving the SOR. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply because Applicant did not present any information to \nshow he sought or obtained any professional assistance in resolving his debts or \nimproving the way he manages his personal finances. As to the latter, he did not present \nany information reflecting how he and his wife manage their income and expenses that \nmight support a conclusion that his financial problems are under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) also does not apply. Even though Applicant has resolved the debts \nlisted at SOR 1.a \u2013 1.c, he did not act in a timely manner to resolve them. He knew about \nthose debts either when he filled out his e-QIP in September 2020 or at the time of his \nDecember 2020 PSI. Nonetheless, he did not take any action until after he received the \nSOR in November 2021 despite the fact that both he and his wife had found regained \nemployment and had in excess of $100,000 annual household income. As to his \nrepossession debt at SOR 1.d, Applicant stated in response to the SOR that he was \naware of that debt when it arose in September 2018. Although he tried to negotiate a \nrepayment plan, he provided conflicting information about the terms the creditor \nproposed. In one version, he described an offer that would have him pay $9,546 (about \n58 percent of the actual debt) over 12 months, which comes to about $795 a month, as \nopposed to the $700 monthly payment he was required to pay before defaulting on the \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nloan. In another version, he described an offer that would have him pay off the debt at a \nmonthly rate of $940 for 12 months. This would equate to a settlement payment of about \n$11,280 (almost 70 percent of the original debt). This, of course, would be a significant \nincrease in monthly payments over the original loan, but Applicant did not present \npersonal financial information in sufficient detail to explain why he could not afford either \nof these pay-off scenarios. For example, if the settlement terms outlined in his Answer \napplied, the $795 payment would have been only somewhat higher than the $700 monthly \nrequired in the original purchase loan. Applicant\u2019s argument that the creditor\u2019s offer in \nsettlement was unaffordable may be viable; however, without more information to \ncorroborate the creditor\u2019s settlement offer, and better information about Applicant\u2019s \nmonthly finances, I cannot conclude that Applicant engaged in good-faith efforts to \nresolve this debt. \nAs to AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant claims his financial problems are rooted in \ncircumstances beyond his control; namely, the loss of his wife\u2019s income in 2002, 2008, \nand 2018 when she was battling cancer. Such events fall squarely within the meaning of \nuncontrollable circumstances; however, to receive the benefit of AG \u00b6 20(b), it also was \nincumbent upon Applicant to show that he acted responsibly in the face of those \ncircumstances. I conclude he did not meet that burden. Between 2018 and 2020, \nApplicant knew he owed the debts alleged in the SOR, yet he did not address SOR 1.a \u2013 \n1.c, which totaled $970, until after he received the SOR in late 2021. From what financial \ninformation he did provide, it is reasonable to conclude that he could have paid those \ndebts in a timelier manner. This information, combined with his purchase of a $60,000 \nvehicle at a time he could have been addressing his any of his past-due debts, raises \ndoubts about Applicant\u2019s judgment when it comes to his finances, and, by extension, other \nareas where his decision-making may be important. On balance, I conclude he did not \nestablish that he acted reasonably or responsibly in the face of whatever financial impacts \nmay have resulted from his wife\u2019s repeated struggles with cancer. \nIn analyzing the record before me, I have considered the information about the \n2011 denial of Applicant\u2019s security clearance because of financial problems that began \nbefore he entered the Army. The SOR in the present case did not allege that information. \nNonetheless, in ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board \nlisted five purposes for which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered. One of \nthose \u2013 to evaluate evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances \u2013 is \napplicable here. In the earlier denial, despite the availability of health insurance when his \nwife first became ill, the number and varying types of debts incurred suggests Applicant \nwas not managing his money responsibly, and that he already was overextended \nfinancially when his wife became unable to work. More recently, after his wife overcame \nher last cancer diagnosis and returned to work in 2019, and after Applicant himself \nreturned to work in 2020, available information shows he did not attend to his financial \nproblems in a responsible way until confronted with the possibility he would not receive a \nsecurity clearance. Applicant bought a motorcycle he did not need while he was still \nunemployed. He bought a $60,000 truck with $700 monthly payments as soon as he \nfound work. After starting his job, he was inattentive to his debts until he received the \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \n \nSOR. Combined with a lack of information about his current finances that would generate \nconfidence in his financial judgment, all of the foregoing sustains the doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s judgment regarding his finances that have been raised by the record evidence \nas a whole. On balance, available information is not sufficient to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised by the Government under this guideline. \nI also have evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed \nat AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered Applicant\u2019s military service, the difficulties Applicant and \nhis wife went through after her three cancer diagnoses, and the positive recommendation \nfrom his supervisor of the past two years. However, it was Applicant\u2019s burden to provide \nsufficient information to establish that he acted responsibly in the wake of uncontrolled \ncircumstances and that his financial problems will not recur. The record evidence as a \nwhole does not show that he met his burden of persuasion. Available information does \nnot resolve the doubts raised by Applicant\u2019s financial history. Because protection of the \nnational interest is the principal focus of these adjudications, any remaining doubts must \nbe resolved against the individual\u2019s request for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, age 38, is divorced and has one daughter. He graduated from high school in May 2003. He has been employed with his current employer since October 2016. Applicant reported no unemployment. He works full time as a quality control inspector. He reported no military service. This is his first request for a security clearance. (Item 3). The Statement of Reasons (SOR) sets forth security concerns under Guidelines F and E. The SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a through 2.j under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) lists ten delinquent accounts totaling approximately $18,000.

He received the FORM on April 21, 2022, but he \ndid not provide additional information after receiving the FORM. The case was assigned \nto me on July 29, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 38, is divorced and has one daughter. He graduated from high \nschool in May 2003. He has been employed with his current employer since October \n2016. Applicant reported no unemployment. He works full time as a quality control \ninspector. He reported no military service. This is his first request for a security clearance. \n(Item 3). \nThe Statement of Reasons (SOR) sets forth security concerns under Guidelines F \nand E. The SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a through 2.j under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) lists ten \ndelinquent accounts totaling approximately $18,000. (Items 5, 6, and 7) Under Guideline \nE, the SOR alleges under SOR 1.a, that Applicant falsified his September 9, 2020 SCA \nby not disclosing his financial delinquencies in response to Section 26 of the SCA. \nFinancial \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted to all of the allegations under \nGuideline F and Guideline E. He provided no explanations in that answer except that \u201che \nmade a mistake on the form.\u201d (Item 2) His 2020 and 2021 credit reports support the \nGuideline F allegations. (Items 5, and 6) The delinquent debts included consumer loans, \nstudent loans, vehicle repossessions, and other collection accounts. \nIn his 2020 subject interview, Applicant responded to questioning concerning his \nfinancial delinquencies. (Item 4) He related information about his four education loans in \ncollection from 2010 0R 2011. Applicant stated that he could not make the minimum \nmonthly payments required after the expiration of his deferment and forbearance periods \nHis financial hardship was due to lack of sufficient income to meet his family\u2019s living \nexpenses. He added that one year ago he applied for student loan forgiveness, but \nreceived no response. Applicant stated that he is arranging monthly payments of $150, \nbut provided no documentation or further information regarding the student loans (Item \n4). \nApplicant explained that his two vehicle repossessions stem from purchases of a \n2015 truck bought in 2017. The truck was repossessed in 2019 after Applicant became \n60 days delinquent on his $439 monthly payment, and on the purchase of a used vehicle \nwhich was repossessed in 2016. He could no longer make the monthly payment of $450. \nApplicant explained that he could not make these vehicle payments due to many medical \nbills resulting from his daughter\u2019s eye surgeries. Applicant explained that the hospital and \nthe surgeon required a substantial sum upfront because his medical insurance did not \ncover the entire cost of the procedures and follow-up care. (Item 4) \nAs for the remaining delinquent debts from a personal loan and a credit card \nopened in 2016 or 2017, Applicant attributed the delinquencies to the ongoing and \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nsubstantial medical debts incurred from his daughter\u2019s eye surgeries. He stated that he \nhad been making some monthly payments but could not continue. Also, when he divorced \nin 2017 he was required to make child support payments of $700 a month. The medical \nbills coupled with the child support payments prevented any payments to his loan and \ncredit card debts. (Item 4) \nApplicant disputed one debt due to identity theft (SOR 1.e.) but there has been no \nresolution. This is reflected in the credit bureau report. He has not received any \ninformation concerning a resolution. (Item 5) His credit bureau report (Item 6) showed \nmultiple accounts that Applicant pays as agreed. \nThere is no information in the record concerning Applicant\u2019s annual income or \nbudget. It does not appear that he has sought financial counseling. He had circumstances \nbeyond his control with the 2017 divorce, child support payments and the many eye \nsurgeries for his child. However, he did not provide any documentation or evidence \nrelating to those events or any payments or payment arrangements that he has made. \nHe has had steady employment since 2012, but did not produce evidence of any small \npayments that he has made for the debts. \nApplicant was asked after his subject interview to provide documentation or \nstatements from creditors, receipts, or agreements. However, he did not provide any of \nthe requested information. He told the investigator that many of his arrangements with \ncreditors was \u201cverbal.\u201d (Item 4) He considers his student loans a priority and wants to \naddress all his debts. He estimates that he could accomplish this in a seven-year period. \nApplicant told the investigator that he did not include any of the delinquent debts on his \nSCA because he was unable to obtain a credit report to provide the required information. \nApplicant stated that he was not attempting to hide any information as he was aware of \nhis financial issues, but he did not have specific details available. (Item 4) \nPersonal Conduct \nAs to SOR 1.a, it was alleged that Applicant falsified material facts on his \nSeptember 2020 SCA by not responding to Section 26-Financial Record Delinquency that \nhe had delinquent bills in the last seven years or had failed to pay as agreed. Applicant \nanswered \u201cNo\u201d to both questions. (Item 3) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process.

The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO \n10865, \u201cAny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.

It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and, \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d) . \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant has unresolved delinquents that are not \npaid. The debts are recent. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. While Applicant\u2019s divorce, child support \npayments and payment for the many medical bills for his daughter\u2019s eye surgeries are \ncircumstances beyond his control, he did not provide any documentation or evidence of \nthe bills. He has been steadily employed since 2012, and did not produce any receipts or \npayment arrangements to judge whether he has acted responsibly to address the \nresulting debts.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are not established. Applicant did not provide any \ndocumentation of obtaining financial counseling or evidence of any good-faith efforts to \nshow what he has done to address the debts. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden to mitigate the financial concerns set out in the \nSOR for lack of sufficient evidence and documentation. For these reasons, I find he has \nnot fully mitigated the security concerns under the financial considerations guideline. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose his financial issues on his SCA although \nhe knew specific details at his subject interview, it is not plausible that he would check \n\u201cNo\u201d to Section 26 because he did not have his credit report available. He intentionally \nomitted the information and falsified material information which raises the following: \nAG \u00b6 16 (a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant admitted and stated that he made a mistake on the SCA but in the \nsubject interview when questioned he knew and was very aware of his current financial \nissues. The investigator confronted Applicant, and then Applicant immediately without \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhelp provided detailed explanations of each issue. He elected not to provide any \nexplanation of his financial condition on the SCA. In doing so, he provided false \ninformation. \nIn this instance, it is clear from Applicant\u2019s comments that therefore, AG \u00b6 16(b) is \nestablished. \nThe personal conduct security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by \nany of the following potentially applicable factors in AG \u00b6 17: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations. \nAfter considering the mitigating conditions outlined above, none of them apply in \nthis case.

She is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with her employment. Guideline F - Financial Considerations The Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because she made financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about her reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. The SOR alleges that Applicant has incurred significant delinquent debt, consisting of twenty delinquent accounts totaling in excess of $159,596. These debts include a vehicle repossession, student loan debt, and other miscellaneous consumer debts. Applicant also failed to file Federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2017 through 2019. Applicant admits all of the allegations, listed in the SOR, except 1.p.

The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865 (EO), Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \nAccess to Classified Information, effective within the DoD after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR (Answer) on March 11, 2022.

As of the date of the Statement of Reasons, the balance is unpaid.\u201d  In \nreference to 1.v., the Government adds that, \u201cApplicant owes a past due balance of \napproximately $1,000.

Applicant\u2019s Federal \ntaxes remain owing \n1.v. Applicant failed to timely file state income tax return for tax years 2017 through \n2019. She owes a past-due balance in the approximate amount of $1,000. Applicant \nfiled these returns in December 2021, however there is no evidence to show that she \nhas paid her delinquent state taxes. (Government Exhibit 4.) Applicant\u2019s state taxes \nremain owing. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;    \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n    \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant incurred significant delinquent debt totaling approximately $159,596. \nShe also failed to file her Federal and state income tax returns in a timely fashion, and \nowes past-due taxes to both tax authorities. The evidence is sufficient to raise the \nabove disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20; \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;     \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant attributes her significant delinquent debt to her divorce in June 2016. It \nhas been six years since her divorce, and she has done nothing to resolve this debt. \nShe states that she plans to contact a debt consolidation agency, but there is nothing \nmore in the record. Applicant failed to respond to the FORM. There is no evidence of \nany payment plans, monthly payments, receipts, or any meaningful attempt or effort on \nher part to otherwise resolve her debts. The debts remain owing. \nIn regard to her income tax returns, there is evidence in the record that she filed \nboth her Federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2017 through 2019 in \nDecember 2021, just eight months ago. The lateness of these filings, however, show \nirresponsibility. It appears that only when she was faced with the threat of not obtaining \nher security clearance did she decide to file the returns in question. Applicant still owes \nback taxes to the Federal and state authorities. Overall, Applicant demonstrates a \npattern of unreliability and untrustworthiness. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \nAccordingly, this guideline is found against the Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.v. \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

(Tr. 27, 41, 45-46) For example, when he was \nmarried the first time from 1990 to 1991, he \u201cnever took a sober breath.\u201d (Tr. 52) He drank \nat least one beer every other day, and he believed it takes 48 hours for a beer to get out \nof his system. (Tr. 52) He attended some Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings during \nhis first marriage and he stopped drinking during his first marriage; however, his first wife \ncontinued to consume alcohol. (Tr. 53) \nDuring the years when Applicant was consuming alcohol, he continued to do so \neven though he attended some AA meetings. (Tr. 53) Some of his periods of sobriety \nwere for a few days, sometimes he was sober for several weeks or for several months. \n(Tr. 53) He told himself \u201cI\u2019m going to quit drinking and then [he] would like forget and [he] \nwould start drinking again. [He] would forget that [he] quit.\u201d (Tr. 53) He would resume \ndrinking, and then go through the same process of quitting and restarting. He was \u201cin and \nout through a revolving door\u201d for several years. (Tr. 53) \nApplicant said he resumed alcohol consumption after 20 years of abstinence in \n2018, because he stopped attending AA meetings; he was divorced; and he was in \nrecovery from surgery for a deviated septum. (Tr. 20, 55) After his surgery, he received a \npain medication which reduced his inhibition against drinking alcohol. (Tr. 21, 55) His \nmother passed away. (Tr. 55) In 2018, he gradually increased the frequency of his alcohol \nconsumption until he was drinking on a daily basis. (Tr. 56) At his worst, he was drinking \n10 drinks a day on weekends. (Tr. 57) \nDuring a May 6, 2020 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) interview, Applicant \ndisclosed he was drinking one to six drinks per day, five or six days a week. (Tr. 58; GE \n4 at 4) He told the OPM investigator that he did not believe he had a drinking problem. Id. \nHe drank to intoxication about once a week. (Tr. 73) He did not drink during the work day; \nhowever, sometimes he worked into the evenings and drank alcohol during a break, and \nthen he resumed working. (Tr. 74-75) It did not occur to Applicant that his alcohol \nconsumption was a security issue. (Tr. 58) He had some alcohol-related blackouts in the \nlate 1980s and the 1990s. (Tr. 59) On June 30, 2021, he was thinking about his security \nclearance on the eve of his psychological evaluation, and he \u201cgot really drunk.\u201d (Tr. 59) \nThe next day, he concluded he definitely needed to abstain from alcohol consumption. \n(Tr. 59) His most recent alcohol-related blackout was on June 30, 2021. (Tr. 77) In July \n2021, he resumed attendance at AA meetings. (Tr. 59) He started working with a sponsor \nand the 12-step AA program. (Tr. 60) At the time of his hearing, he attended one to three \nAA meetings a week. (Tr. 66) \nApplicant does not see a medical or mental-health person to address his alcohol \nconsumption. (Tr. 67) He has been taking a prescription drug for depression for 15 years. \n(Tr. 68-69) His general practitioner renews his prescription for depression.

Recurrent alcohol use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations \nat work, school, or home. \n6. Continued alcohol use despite having persistent or recurrent social or \ninterpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of alcohol. \n7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or \nreduced because of alcohol use. \n8. Recurrent alcohol use in situations in which it is physically hazardous. \n9. Alcohol use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or \nrecurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been \ncaused or exacerbated by alcohol. \n10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: \na. A need for markedly increased amounts of alcohol to achieve \nintoxication or desired effect. \nb. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same \namount of alcohol. \n11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following: \na.

Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro.

Additional discussion is \nin the mitigation section, infra. \nAG \u00b6 23 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b).   \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply; however, Applicant provided some \nimportant mitigating information. He voluntarily and credibly disclosed his history of \nalcohol consumption during his OPM interview, during his July 2021 mental-health \nevaluation, and at his hearing. He attended and completed counseling while he was in the \nAir Force. He attended numerous AA meetings. He was abstinent from alcohol \nconsumption for several relatively brief periods and completely abstinent for 20 years \n(1998 to 2018). He was abstinent from alcohol consumption from July 1, 2021 to his \nhearing on April 29, 2022. He has never been arrested or convicted of any alcohol-related \noffense. There is no evidence of security violations or abuse of illegal drugs. \nDSM-5 at 491 defines early and sustained remission as follows: \nIn early remission: After full criteria for alcohol use disorder were previously \nmet, none of the criteria for alcohol use disorder have been met for at least \n3 months but for less than 12 months (with the exception that Criterion A4, \n\u201cCraving, or a strong desire or urge to use alcohol,\u201d may be met). \nIn sustained remission: After full criteria for alcohol use disorder were \npreviously met, none of the criteria for alcohol use disorder have been met \nat any time during a period of 12 months or longer (with the exception that \nCriterion A4, \u201cCraving, or a strong desire or urge to use alcohol,\u201d may be \nmet).                    \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has met the criteria for early remission under DSM-5 as he has not had \nany employment, legal, familial, or relationship difficulties (DSM-5 criteria) for more than \n10 months. He currently has control of his alcohol consumption, and it has a limited role \nin his life. I found Applicant to be sincere, credible, and candid. However, his satisfaction \nof the DSM-5 criteria for early remission or even sustained remission does not necessarily \nestablish mitigation for security clearance requirements. \nThe evidence against mitigation is more persuasive at this time. Applicant had \nseveral instances of alcohol-related memory loss or an alcohol blackout with his most \nrecent blackout occurring on June 30, 2021. The memory loss was due to binge-alcohol \nconsumption. In an alcohol blackout, a person: \nis still fully conscious. They\u2019re moving around, acting, engaging, talking, \ndancing, driving, engaging in all kinds of behavior, but because of alcohol\u2019s \ninhibition of the transfer of information from short-term memory to long-term \nmemory, they simply will be unable to remember those decisions or actions \nthey made while in the blackout. \nIn United States v. Pease, 74 M.J. 763, 769 (N-M. Ct. Crim. App. 2015), an expert \non the effects of alcohol intoxication, Dr. Kim Fromme, Ph.D., described the levels of \nalcohol intoxication and the impact on human behavior, cognitive abilities, and memory. \nSee also United States v. Collins, No. 201000020, 2011 CCA LEXIS 22 at *4-*8. (N-M. \nCt. Crim. App. 2011) (unpub.) (testimony of prosecution toxicology expert, Jon \nJemiomek). \nA person who is in a blacked-out state may still \u201cengage in voluntary behavior and \nthought processes. \u2018They might make decisions, for example, to drive home from a bar, \nor [engage in other] . . . activities which require complex cognitive abilities, but the \nindividual might not remember the next day and might, in fact, might regret it.\u2019\u201d Pease, 74 \nM.J. at 769. See also United States v. Clark, NMCCA 201400232 at *13-*17, *22-*23. \n(NMCCCA Jul. 14, 2015) (statements of Dr. Stafford Henry, M.D. and Dr. Thomas \nGrieger, M.D.). A person who consumes alcohol to a blacked-out state may not remember \nhow much alcohol they consumed, or they may violate national security and have no \nrecollection of their conduct.  \nOn July 26, 2021, Dr. Graves, Psy.D., diagnosed Applicant with Alcohol Use \nDisorder Severe despite almost one month of sobriety before the evaluation, and a \nprevious 20-year period of sobriety. In 2018, Applicant resumed his alcohol consumption \nbecause of stress in his life. He chose to stop attending AA meetings; he was divorced, \nand he was in recovery from surgery for a deviated septum. After his surgery, he received \na pain medication which reduced his inhibition against drinking alcohol. His mother \npassed away. He engaged in binge-alcohol consumption shortly before Dr. Graves\u2019 \nevaluation because of stress. He may have stressful situations in the future and resume \nalcohol consumption. \nApplicant\u2019s history of alcohol consumption and the possibility of renewed alcohol \nconsumption cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment.

A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nAG \u00b6 28 provides one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, \u201c(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional \nthat the individual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness.\u201d AG \u00b6 28(b) is established.  Additional discussion of this disqualifying \ncondition will be included in the mitigation section, infra. \nFive mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nOn July 26, 2021, Dr. Graves diagnosed Applicant with Alcohol Use Disorder \nSevere. She concluded his history of alcohol consumption \u201clikely impairs his judgment, \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to safeguard classified information.\u201d (GE 3 at 6) As \ndiscussed in the previous section, his alcohol consumption raises serious security \nconcerns. Not enough time without alcohol consumption has elapsed. I have lingering \nconcerns that Applicant will again be under stress, will again resume alcohol \nconsumption, and then he may make poor security-related decisions in the future. \nPsychological conditions security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines G and \nI are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 53-year-old ISSO who has worked for a DOD contractor for the \nprevious eight years. In 1999, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree, and in 2003, he received \na master\u2019s degree in information systems management. He has about eight security or \ninformation technology certifications. He served in the Air Force from 1987 to 2011, and \nhe honorably retired as a master sergeant. He has held a security clearance continuously \nsince he was age 18. There is no evidence of criminal offenses, drug abuse, or security \nviolations. \nThe evidence against grant of Applicant\u2019s access to classified information is more \npersuasive. Applicant has a history of binge-alcohol consumption and several alcohol \nblackouts, including a blackout on June 30, 2021, shortly before his mental-health \nevaluation. In July 2021, Dr. Graves diagnosed him with Alcohol Use Disorder Severe \nand commented that his history of alcohol consumption \u201clikely impairs his judgment, \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to safeguard classified information.\u201d (GE 3 at 6) In \n2018, despite a history including completion of Air Force alcohol-related counseling and \nattendance at AA meetings, he resumed consumption of alcohol.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 34 years old and twice divorced, with two minor children. He is employed by a defense contractor as a Driver. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. Guideline F - Financial Considerations The Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he made financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. The SOR alleges that the Applicant is indebted to eleven delinquent accounts totaling in excess of $37,000. Applicant admits all of the debts listed in the SOR. Credit reports of the Applicant dated March 21, 2020; and August 26, 2026, confirm the indebtedness. (Government Exhibits 5 and 6.)

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant is indebted to a number of creditors for delinquent accounts totaling at \nin excess of at least $37,000 that have been placed for collection or have been charged \noff. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20; \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nand    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant is delinquently indebted to all but one of the creditors set forth in the \nSOR. He has failed to provide sufficient evidence in mitigation. This shows poor \njudgment and unreliability. Accordingly, Applicant does not meet the requirements to \naccess classified information. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nWhile Applicant claims that he has entered into payment agreements, and has \nbeen making payments toward his debts, with the exception of one account, he has \nsubmitted no documentary evidence to support these claims. \nI considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all relevant facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nFinancial Considerations security concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.: through 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i.  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j and I.k. \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

On April 11, 2022, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing \nfor June 7, 2022.

(HE 1C) On June 9, 2022, DOHA issued \nthe third notice of hearing which scheduled the hearing for July 7, 2022. (HE 1D) The \nhearing was held as scheduled on July 7, 2022. \nDepartment Counsel offered three exhibits into evidence, and Applicant did not \noffer any exhibits into evidence at his hearing; however, he provided four documents as \nattachments to the SOR. (Transcript (Tr.) 16-17, 22-26; GE 1-GE 3) There were no \nobjections, and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. (Tr. 23-26) On July 25, \n2022, DOHA received a transcript of the hearing. After the hearing, Applicant provided \ntwo exhibits. (Applicant Exhibit (AE) A (111 pages) and AE B (53 pages)) Department \nCounsel objected to admission of AE B because it was not timely. (AE B at 1) I overruled \nthe objection and admitted AE B.

C) \nAlcohol Consumption, Criminal Conduct, and Personal Conduct  \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant consumed alcohol, at times to the point of intoxication, \nfrom about 1998 to at least September 2020. In his SOR response, he admitted this \nallegation. His April 7, 2021, Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject \ninterview (PSI) indicates that during the period from 2008 to 2015, he consumed alcohol \non a near daily basis, and he drank to intoxication three to four times a week. (GE 3 at 1) \nWhen he drank to intoxication, he consumed four or more beers or a bottle and a half of \nwine. (Id.) \nIn his SOR response, Applicant said he reduced his alcohol consumption in 2016. \nAt his hearing, he said he did not consume alcohol during the week. (Tr. 29) He generally \nlimited his alcohol consumption to a drink or two with dinner. (Tr. 29) He has not \nexcessively consumed alcohol since December 15, 2021. (Tr. 30; SOR response) He \nconsumed alcohol excessively as a coping mechanism. (Tr. 32) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges in about March 2003, Applicant was arrested and charged with\ndriving while alcohol impaired (DWI) and careless driving. He admitted this allegation. (Tr. \n31) He said his blood alcohol content (BAC) was close to .08; however, he did not \nremember the specific BAC.

Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfacts.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c) provide: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as \nan alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; and \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c) are established. The SOR alleges five alcohol-related \nincidents involving the police and courts. Applicant was arrested or charged in 2003, \n2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 (probation violation due to 2016 DUI) for alcohol-related \noffenses. His OPM PSI indicates he has a history of drinking to intoxication and having \nalcohol-related blackouts. His denial of having alcohol-related blackouts is not credible. \nAlthough the term \u201cbinge\u201d drinking is not defined in the Directive, his alcohol-related \nblackouts are an indication of alcohol consumption at a high enough level to establish \nApplicant engaged in binge-alcohol consumption to the extent of impaired judgment. \nFour alcohol consumption mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a)-23(d) are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, and \nis making satisfactory progress; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization \nand has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical \nprofessional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a \nrecognized alcohol treatment program. \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nApplicant reduced his alcohol consumption in 2016. He does not consume alcohol \nduring the week. He generally limits his alcohol consumption to a drink or two with dinner. \nHe has not excessively consumed alcohol since December 15, 2021. He has not been \narrested for an alcohol-related offense since 2016. His first probation violation related to \nhis most recent DUI in 2016. His alcohol-related criminal offenses are not recent. He \ncompleted an alcohol-related class. He acknowledged his issues of alcohol abuse, \nprovided evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and established a pattern \nof responsible alcohol use. \nApplicant currently consumes alcohol responsibly. Because of his reduced levels \nof alcohol consumption, his alcohol offenses are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and 23(b) are \nestablished.

By its very \nnature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 31 lists three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n(d) violation or revocation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a \ncourt-mandated rehabilitation program. \nFrom 2003 to 2017, Applicant had five arrests or criminal charges. He admitted \nthat he engaged in criminal conduct. He served a six-day jail term and received a fine for \nprobation violations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), 31(b), and 31(d) are established. \nAG \u00b6 32 describes four conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant presented some important mitigating information. He received job \ntraining and counseling; he obtained higher education; he successfully served nine years \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nin the Marine Corps and completed two combat tours in Iraq. His resume indicates he has \nachieved substantial professional development. His alcohol-related offenses ended in \n2016, and they are not recent. He reduced his level of alcohol consumption in 2016. His \ncurrent level of alcohol consumption is at a responsible level.  \nApplicant\u2019s arrests and convictions from 2003 to 2016 remain relevant as they \nshow a pattern of disregarding laws and legal requirements. He has known about \nwarrants for his arrest for the violations of the protective order for more than one year, \nand he has not reported to the court to resolve the matter. He has not provided a specific \ndate within the next calendar year when he intends to report to the court. The offenses \nshow a serious lapse of judgment. \nIn addition, Applicant submitted an inaccurate resume about his education as part \nof his SOR response. His SCA minimized his history of alcohol-related offenses. These \nlapses raise questions about his creditability and rehabilitation. See ISCR Case No. 20-\n01577 at 3 (App. Bd. June 6, 2022) (citing ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. \n26, 2006) (listing the purposes for which non-alleged conduct can be considered)).   \nThere is insufficient proof of rehabilitation. The totality of circumstances continues \nto cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Criminal \nconduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe SOR alleges three disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6 16 that are relevant in this \ncase. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), 16(d)(3), and 16(e)(1) provide: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information;  \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may \nnot properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This includes but \nis not limited to consideration of:  . . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule \nviolations; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing . . . . \nThe conduct described under Guideline J is sufficient for an adverse security \ndetermination. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d) are not established. Security officials and law \nenforcement officials are aware of Applicant\u2019s history of criminal activity. AG \u00b6 16(e) is \nnot established. Personal conduct security concerns are duplications of security concerns \naddressed under other guidelines, and they are refuted. \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be\ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other\nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental\nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to\nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n12 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 includes one disqualifying condition that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, \nstate, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required.\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6 19(f). Further discussion of this \ndisqualifying condition and the applicability of mitigating conditions is contained in the \nmitigation section, infra.  \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority\nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those\narrangements.  \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for TYs 2016, \n2017, 2018, and 2019. He filed these income tax returns in early 2021. \nA willful failure to timely make (means complete and file with the IRS) a federal \nincome tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal offense. Title 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203, \nwillful failure to file return or supply information, reads: \nAny person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority \nthereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who \n13 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwillfully fails to . . .  make such return, keep such records, or supply such \ninformation, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in \naddition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor . . . . \nA willful failure to make return, keep records, or supply information when required, \nis a misdemeanor without regard to the existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United \nStates, 317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States v. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th  Cir. 1973); United \nStates v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th  Cir. 1969); O\u2019Brien v. United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th  \nCir. 1931). For purposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant\u2019s failure to timely \nfile his federal income tax returns against him as a crime. In regard to the failure to timely \nfile federal and state income tax returns, the DOHA Appeal Board has commented: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis in original). See ISCR \nCase No. 15-01031 at 4 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (citations omitted); ISCR Case No. 14-\n05476 at 5 (App. Bd.

The Appeal Board \nclarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [his or her] \nfederal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated to prevent such \nproblems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant\u2019s security \nworthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility\u201d \nincluding a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 \nat 3 & n.3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d approach to an \napplicant\u2019s course of conduct and employing an \u201call\u2019s well that ends well\u201d analysis as \ninadequate to support approval of access to classified information with focus on timing of \nfiling of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-01031 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board explained \nthat in some situations, even if no taxes are owed when tax returns are not timely filed, \ngrant of access to classified information may be inappropriate. In ISCR Case No. 15-1031 \n(App. Bd. June 15, 2016) the applicant filed his 2011 federal income tax return in \nDecember 2013, his 2012 federal tax return in September 2014, and his 2013 federal tax \nreturn in October 2015. He received federal tax refunds of at least $1,000 for each year. \n14 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nNevertheless, the Appeal Board reversed the administrative judge\u2019s decision to grant \naccess to classified information. \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal Board \nreversed the grant of a security clearance, discussed how AG \u00b6 20(g) applied, and noted: \nThe timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who \nbegins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that \nhis clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat \nto his own interests. In this case, applicant\u2019s filing of his Federal income tax \nreturns for 2009-2014 after submitting his SCA, undergoing his background \ninterview, or receiving the SOR undercuts the weight such remedial action \nmight otherwise merit. \nApplicant filed his federal and state income tax returns for TYs 2016, 2017, 2018, \nand 2019 in early 2021, after he completed his December 16, 2020 SCA. Under all the \ncircumstances including careful consideration of the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence, I \nconclude Applicant failed to establish mitigation of financial considerations security \nconcerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines G, J, E, \nand F are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 41-year-old senior field engineer who concentrates on test \nengineering and systems integration. In 2008, he received a certification in aviation \n15 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \nmaintenance, which is equivalent to an associate\u2019s degree. He needs to complete one \ncourse to receive his bachelor\u2019s degree in aeronautics. \nApplicant served five years on active duty in the Marine Corps, and four years in \nthe Marine Corps Reserve. He served in Iraq from March to November 2004, and from \nMay to October 2005. His Marine Corps evaluations in 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011 \nindicated \u201cOne of the many highly qualified professionals who form the majority of this \ngrade.\u201d (AE A at 87, 92, 97, 102, 107) He was a sergeant when he was discharged, and \nhe received an honorable discharge. His two deployments show his significant sacrifices \non his nation\u2019s behalf. His resume describes his important contributions to the nation as \na government contractor. Applicant received multiple Marine Corps awards. In November \n2020, he received a certificate of achievement from his employer. \nApplicant\u2019s arrests, charges, and convictions from 2003 to 2017 show a pattern of \ndisregarding laws and legal requirements. He has known about warrants for his arrest for \nthe violations of the protective order for more than one year, and he has not reported to \nthe court to resolve the matter. He did not provide a specific date within the next calendar \nyear when he intends to report to the court. Waiting up to a year to address an arrest \nwarrant shows a lack of judgment and trustworthiness. He did not timely file his federal \nand state income tax returns for TYs 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. His filing of the overdue \ntax returns in early 2021 occurred after he submitted his December 16, 2020 SCA, and \nthe untimely filing of these tax returns is too late to fully mitigate this violation of IRS \nregulations. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more effort towards establishing a track record of behavior consistent with his \nobligations, he may well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security \nclearance worthiness. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on November 17, 2020. \nOn December 17, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging security concerns under Guideline F. The CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on a date not indicated in the record (Answer), and \nrequested a decision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On March 8, 2022, \nthe Government sent Applicant a file of relevant material (FORM), including evidentiary \ndocuments identified as Items 1 through 5. He was given an opportunity to submit a \ndocumentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or \nexplanation to the Government\u2019s evidence.

Applicant\u2019s Answer included documents that are admitted into evidence as \nApplicant Exhibit (AE) A. Although Item 4 was not authenticated as required by Directive \n\u00b6 E3.1.20, I conclude that Applicant waived any objection to Item 4. The Government \nincluded in the FORM a prominent notice advising Applicant of his right to object to the \nadmissibility of Item 4 on the ground that it was not authenticated. Applicant was also \nnotified that if he did not raise an objection to Item 4 in his response to the FORM, or if \nhe did not respond to the FORM, he could be considered to have waived any such \nobjection, and that Item 4 could be considered as evidence in his case. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 54, is married with two adult children. He received his high school \ndiploma in 1987. He attended an online college from 2006 through 2008, without earning \na degree. He honorably served the U.S. Air Force from 1990 through 1999. He has been \nemployed as a technical services analyst by a defense contractor since 2019. He \npreviously maintained a security clearance during his military service. (Item 3; Item 4 at \n8; Item 5 at 13) \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for tax years (TY) 2014, \n2015, and 2016 (as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a) and also for TY 2017 through 2019. I will \nconsider the unalleged TY only to evaluate mitigation and the whole person. He did not \nrequest a filing extension in any of those TY. He filed his 2014, 2015, and 2017 returns \non May 1, 2020; his 2018 and 2019 returns on October 20, 2020; and his 2016 return on \nJune 15, 2021. He made a $2,285 payment with his 2014 return; and a $1,683 payment \nwith his 2017 return. The IRS returned the 2016 return to Applicant on September 28, \n2021 because it was missing a signature. He returned the signed 2016 return to the IRS \non a date not indicated in the record sometime before he submitted the Answer. (AE A at \n1, 3, 4, 6, and 7; Item 2; Item 5 at 22-24) \nApplicant failed to timely pay his federal income taxes for TY 2017 through 2019 \n(as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b) and also for TY 2014. He owed $1,826 for TY 2014 as of \nJanuary 2022. He owed a total of $3,312 for TY 2017 through 2019 as of April 2021. I will \nconsider the 2014 debt only to evaluate mitigation and the whole person. A January 2022 \nIRS account transcript reflected that an installment agreement to repay the 2014 debt \nwas established by the IRS in November 2021. The terms of that agreement were not \nindicated in the transcript. In the Answer, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6 1.b and stated: \u201cI \nadmit that I am in debt to the Federal Government and the balance, in full, has yet to be \npaid.\u201d He also asserted that he was paying his federal tax debt pursuant to an installment \nagreement approved by the IRS via $200 monthly payments on the 15th  of each month. \nBecause the 2014 debt was not alleged, it was unclear whether his reference to Federal \nGovernment \u201cdebt\u201d included that TY.

Applicant did not proffer documents \ncorroborating any payments made pursuant to IRS besides those he submitted with his \nreturns. (AE A at 1-2, 4; Item 5 at 22-24) \nApplicant also failed to timely file his state income tax returns and to pay his state \nincome taxes for TY 2014 through 2019. As of April 2021, he owed a total of $13,879 for \nTY 2014 through 2019, which the state agreed he could pay via $1,164 monthly payments \nto begin April 8, 2021. Although the filing dates were not equivocally stated in the record, \nhe apparently filed his TY 2014 through 2019 state returns sometime between May 2020 \nand April 2021. Because the SOR alleged only the state tax debt owed (SOR \u00b6 1.c), I will \nconsider his failure to timely file state returns only to evaluate mitigation and the whole \nperson. In a personal financial statement Applicant completed in June 2021, he \nreferenced a $268 monthly payment for state taxes, but did not provide any proof of those \npayments. In the Answer, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6 1.c and asserted that he was paying \nhis state tax debt pursuant to an installment agreement approved by the state. The \ndocument he provided with the Answer to corroborate that agreement reflected that he \nmade one $320 payment on November 19, 2021, but did not reference any tax years or \nthe terms of the agreement. Applicant did not proffer documents corroborating any other \npayments made pursuant to the agreement. (Item 3 at 39-41; Item 4 at 2-3; Item 5 at 15, \n20-21) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s April 2020 subject interview (SI), he attributed his delay in filing \nTY 2014 through 2017 returns to traveling so frequently for work and what he described \nas miscommunication with his wife. He explained that he never explicitly asked his wife \nwhether the tax returns had been filed, but just assumed that they had. He maintained \nthat he simply forgot to file his TY 2018 returns and had not yet filed his TY 2019 returns \ndue to COVID-19. I took administrative notice of the fact that the IRS extended the \ndeadline for TY 2019 returns to July 15, 2020. (Item 4 at 2-3, 8) \nDuring the SI, Applicant acknowledged that he was not good at filing and \nmaintaining paperwork and had never made his finances, including taxes, a priority in his \nlife. He claimed that he was not aware that his wife had not filed their TY 2014 through \n2017 returns until sometime in 2018, when he was going through years of unopened mail \nand noticed a bunch of employee withholding (W-4) forms. He explained that piles and \npiles of unopened mail had accumulated at his home while he was travelling for work \nbetween 2015 and 2018. Although his wife did check the mail during that time, she never \nopened any mail addressed to Applicant or any mail involving taxes or employee \nwithholding forms. (Item 4 at 3-4) \nDuring the SI, Applicant acknowledged that he could have been more proactive in \ndealing with his mail and other important information since he only traveled for work two \nweeks of every month. He decided to finally go through his mail in 2018 because he \nrealized that he was getting older and wanted to get his financial life in order in preparation \nfor retirement. He planned to avoid future filing delays by asking his son-in-law (who had \nrecently earned a finance degree) to handle his tax filings every year. He expressed his \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nregret for assuming that his taxes were taken care of by his wife and promised to work \nhard to avoid that miscommunication in the future. (Item 4 at 4-5) \nIn Applicant\u2019s November 2020 SCA, he provided the following explanation for why \nhe failed to timely file his federal and state returns for TY 2014 through 2017: \u201cworking as \n[sic] contractor moving from contract to contract, I thought my wife had filed them and she \nthought I filed them.\u201d He did not provide a reason for TY 2018 and 2019. The information \nhe provided in the SCA about the status of his return filings and tax payments was \nconfusing, which suggested that he apparently either partially filled out or completed \nanother SCA prior to November 2020 that was not included in the record (particularly \nsince he was interviewed in April 2020). Nevertheless, Applicant clearly articulated that \nhe had been working with the state tax authority to resolve his state tax issues and sought \nout professional financial and legal advice to help him resolve his federal tax issues. He \nindicated that his delinquent state and federal tax returns had either been filed or were in \nthe process of being filed, and that he intended to remediate any associated delinquent \ntaxes or penalties. (Item 3 at 39-41) \nIn Applicant\u2019s June 2021 response to interrogatories propounded by the CAF, he \nattributed the miscommunication with his wife about their TY 2014 through 2017 taxes to \nthe fact that she worked at night so they did not talk much. He declared that the \u201cUSA is \n[his] beloved home,\u201d and that he was trying to correct his mistakes and doing his best to \nfix the concerns identified by the CAF. (Item 5 at 13-14) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. (ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 20, 2016)). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe general concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18, as follows: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)) \nThe record evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations); and AG \u00b6 19(f) \n(failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or \nfailure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required). \nHaving considered all of the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the \nconcern under this guideline, I find the following relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant failed to proffer a justifiable excuse for failing to file his returns over such \nan extended period. While his travel schedule, miscommunication with his wife, and \nCOVID-19 contributed to the filing \ndelays, the record suggests that procrastination and avoidance surrounding his tax \nobligations played a more significant role. He is credited with eventually filing his TY 2014 \nthrough 2019 returns and making arrangements to resolve his tax debts before the SOR \nwas issued. However, he failed to establish a meaningful track record of regular and \ntimely payments to the IRS and the state pursuant to those payment arrangements. \nMoreover, he demonstrated poor judgment and a willingness to place his own self-interest \nabove his legal obligations, which casts doubt as to whether he may also act similarly in \nthe context of his security obligations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (b), (d), and (g) are not established. \nAccordingly, I cannot conclude that Applicant has mitigated the Guideline F concerns at \nthis time. He may be able to overcome these security concerns at some future date should \nhe establish a sufficient pattern of compliance with his tax obligations. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Formal Findings \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised \nby his delinquent tax debts and failure to timely file his income tax returns. Accordingly, \nApplicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant or continue Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

The DCSA CAF explained in the SOR why it \nwas unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for him. The DCSA CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective June 8, 2017, applicable to all \nadjudications for national security eligibility or eligibility to hold a sensitive position. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nOn January 10, 2022, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a \ndecision on the written record in lieu of a hearing before a Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) administrative judge. The Government submitted a File of Relevant \nMaterial (FORM) on March 21, 2022, consisting of a statement of its position and ten \nexhibits pre-marked as Items 1 through 10, which included the SOR (Item 1) and Answer to \nthe SOR (Item 2). DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant on March 22, 2022, \nand instructed him that any response was due within 30 days of receipt. Applicant received \nthe FORM on April 1, 2022. No response was received by the May 1, 2022 deadline. \nOn June 15, 2022, the case was assigned to me to determine whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance \nfor Applicant. I received the case file on June 20, 2022. \nEvidentiary Rulings \nDepartment Counsel submitted as Item 5 in the FORM a summary report of a \npersonal subject interview (PSI) of Applicant conducted on February 25, 2010, by an \nauthorized investigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The summary \nreport of the PSI was included in a DOD report of investigation (ROI) in Applicant\u2019s case. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the Directive, a DOD personal background ROI may be received in \nevidence and considered with an authenticating witness, provided it is otherwise admissible \nunder the Federal Rules of Evidence. The summary report did not bear the authentication \nrequired for admissibility under \u00b6 E3.1.20. \nIn ISCR Case No. 16-03126 decided on January 24, 2018, the DOHA Appeal Board \nheld that it was not error for an administrative judge to admit and consider a summary of a \nPSI where the applicant was placed on notice of his or her opportunity to object to \nconsideration of the summary; the applicant filed no objection to it; and there is no \nindication that the summary contained inaccurate information. In this case, Applicant was \nprovided a copy of the FORM and advised of his opportunity to submit objections or \nmaterial that he wanted the administrative judge to consider. In the FORM, Applicant\u2019s \nattention was directed to the following notice regarding Item 5: \nIMPORTANT NOTICE TO APPLICANT: The attached summary of your \nPersonal Subject Interview (PSI) (Item 5) is being provided to the \nAdministrative Judge for consideration as part of the record evidence \nin this case. In your response to this [FORM], you can comment on \nwhether the PSI summary accurately reflects the information you \nprovided to the authorized OPM investigator(s) and you can make any \ncorrections, additions, deletions, and updates necessary to make the \nsummary clear and accurate.

Pro se \napplicants are not expected to act like lawyers, but they are expected to take timely and \nreasonable steps to protect their rights under the Directive. See ISCR Case No. 12-10810 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2016). See also ADP Case No. 17-03252 (App. Bd. Aug. 13, 2018) \n(holding that it was reasonable for the administrative judge to conclude that any objection \nhad been waived by an applicant\u2019s failure to object after being notified of the right to \nobject). \nApplicant was advised in \u00b6 E3.1.4 of the Directive that he may request a hearing. In \n\u00b6 E3.1.15, he was advised that he is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, \nor mitigate facts admitted by him or proven by Department Counsel and that he has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision. While the \nDirective does not specifically provide for a waiver of the authentication requirement, \nApplicant was placed on sufficient notice of his opportunity to object to the admissibility of \nthe interview summary report, to comment on the interview summary, and to make any \ncorrections, deletions, or updates to the information in the report. Applicant did not respond \nto the FORM. \nGovernment officials are entitled to a presumption of regularity in the discharge of \ntheir official responsibilities. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-07539 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, 2018). \nApplicant can reasonably be held to have read the PSI summary in Item 5, and there is no \nevidence that he failed to understand his obligation to file any objections to the summary if \nhe did not want the administrative judge to consider it. Accordingly, I find that Applicant \nwaived any objections to the PSI summary. Items 1 through 10 are accepted as evidence \nfor my consideration subject to issues of relevance and materiality in light of the entire \nrecord. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline H, and cross-references under Guideline E (SOR \n\u00b6 2.a) that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about 2008 to at least \nNovember 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that he was arrested for possession of a controlled \nsubstance in February 1992 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), possession of marijuana in January 1996 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.c), and felony possession of a controlled substance, possession of marijuana, and \npossession of drug paraphernalia in November 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.e); and that he tested \npositive for marijuana in a March 2009 urinalysis test (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Additionally, under \nGuideline E, Applicant is alleged to have falsified his October 13, 2020 Electronic \nQuestionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) by responding negatively to an inquiry \ninto whether he had ever been charged for an offense involving alcohol or drugs and \ndeliberately concealing the drug charges in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.e.

He asserted that he knew he \ncould not hide public information from the DOD. (Item 2.) \nAfter considering Items 1 through 10 in the FORM, I make the following findings of \nfact. \nApplicant is a 54-year-old high school graduate. He served on active duty in the \nUnited States Air Force from October 1986 until April 1990, when he was granted a general \ndischarge under honorable conditions. The circumstances that led to his discharge are not \nin evidence. Applicant has been married since May 2000 and has two daughters, now in \ntheir early 30s, from previous relationships. He has worked as an aircraft maintenance \ntechnician for a defense contractor most recently since December 2009. He previously \nworked for the company as a flight operations mechanic from November 1998 until March \n2000, when he was laid off. (Items 3-5.) \nApplicant was employed outside of the defense industry from March 2000 to \nDecember 2009. (Items 3-5.) With his return to work for the defense contractor contingent \non him obtaining an interim clearance, Applicant completed and certified as accurate an e-\nQIP on December 9, 2009. He responded negatively to the e-QIP\u2019s police record inquiries, \nincluding whether he had ever been charged with any offenses related to alcohol or drugs. \nHe answered \u201cYes\u201d to a question concerning any illegal drug use in the last seven years \nand indicated that he smoked marijuana once on vacation in February 2009. He responded \nnegatively to an inquiry into any counseling or treatment in the last seven years because of \nhis use of illegal drugs. (Item 3.) \nA Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) records check on December 18, 2009, \nrevealed that he had been arrested in May 1990 for assault and battery; in January 1996 \nfor possession of marijuana; and in April 2001 for violation of an ex parte order. (Item 6.) \nOn February 25, 2010, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOPM. He explained about his January 1996 marijuana arrest that he was visiting a person, \nwhom he later learned was a drug dealer, when police raided the residence. He was \narrested for having a small amount of marijuana on his person and spent a night in jail \nbefore being released. The charge was subsequently dismissed. As for his reported use of \nmarijuana, he was on vacation with some friends for his wife\u2019s birthday, and they all \nsmoked marijuana. After he returned from the vacation, he was selected for a random drug \nscreen by his then employer in March 2009, and he tested positive for marijuana. He was \nrequired by his then employer to attend a drug and alcohol awareness program, which he \nsaid consisted of one session a week for one month.

(Item 10.) \nOn June 24, 2020, the DOD Continuous Evaluation Program developed unreported \ninformation (validated on July 2, 2020) that Applicant had been arrested on November 21, \n2017, and charged with felony possession of a controlled substance except 35 grams or \nless of marijuana/ synthetic cannabinoid; possession of marijuana/synthetic cannabinoid of \n11-35 grams; and unlawful possession of drug paraphernalia. (Items 9, 10.) The police \nrecords show that Applicant had been involved in an accident with another vehicle. The \nresponding officers detected the odor of burnt marijuana about Applicant, whose vehicle \nwas then searched. A small bag of marijuana was in plain view on the floorboard in the \nbackseat of the car. Additionally, the police seized a metal grinder containing marijuana \nand, from the center console, a small bag containing suspected crack cocaine. During a \nsearch of Applicant\u2019s person incident to his arrest, the police found a small metal pipe \ncontaining burnt residue in his back pocket. Laboratory tests revealed that approximately \n2.2 grams of marijuana and 1.3 grams of cocaine had been seized from Applicant\u2019s \nvehicle. On March 13, 2018, the county prosecutor notified the police that the case would \nnot be prosecuted. (Item 8.) The reason for the declination of prosecution is not in \nevidence.  \nOn October 13, 2020, Applicant completed and certified as accurate an e-QIP on \nwhich he responded negatively to the police record inquiries, including the following: \nIn the last seven (7) years have you been arrested by any police officer, \nsheriff, marshal or other type of law enforcement official?; \nHave you EVER been charged with any felony offense? (Include those under \nthe Uniform Code of Military Justice and non-military/civilian felony offenses); \nand \nHave you EVER been charged with an offense involving alcohol or drugs? \nApplicant also responded negatively to e-QIP inquiries concerning any illegal use of \na drug or controlled substance in the last seven years and any illegal use or illegal \ninvolvement with a drug or controlled substance while possessing a security clearance. In \nresponse to a question about whether he had ever been ordered to seek treatment \nbecause of illegal drug use, Applicant responded that he had failed a drug test in 2008 [sic] \nand attended a program from March 2009 to November 2009 after testing positive for \nmarijuana. Applicant reported no alcohol-related incidents, counseling, or treatment on his \ne-QIP. He answered negatively to the following question: \nIn the last seven (7) years has your use of alcohol had a negative impact on \nyour work performance, your professional or personal relationships, your \nfinances, or resulted in intervention by law enforcement/public safety \npersonnel?

When asked whether he had been \narrested or detained in the last seven years, Applicant responded that he was detained for \na short time in the Fall of 2017 but added that he thought only arrests had to be disclosed. \nHe explained that he had been rear-ended by another vehicle and for some reason the \npolice felt he was intoxicated even though he passed a breathalyzer test. He denied that he \nhad been charged with other offenses, even after he was confronted with the drug charges. \nHe asserted that he had not used marijuana since his treatment in 2008 and would not use \nany drugs in the future; that his brother had sometimes used his name and been in legal \ntrouble; and that he had reported this to the police. He stated that he had never been \nnotified of a drug arrest; was unaware of it; and it did not happen. (Item 7.) \nApplicant is the only listed suspect on the police records of the November 2017 \nincident. The personally identifying information (PII) for Applicant on the police report, \nincluding the home address, date of birth, age, social security number, height and weight \n(within five pounds), matches his PII on his October 2020 e-QIP. (Items 4, 9.) The police \nreport also contains a driver\u2019s license number for Applicant. (Item 9.) The brother named by \nApplicant as having used his name on occasion is five years younger than Applicant, and \nhe has a different address. (Item 4.) \nOn November 3, 2021, Applicant completed interrogatories from DOHA. In response \nto an inquiry into whether he had ever illegally used any drugs or controlled substances, \nApplicant responded that he had used \u201cPot\u201d one time, in 2009, and he did not intend to use \nthe drug in the future. (Item 7.) \nWhen Applicant responded to the SOR on January 10, 2022, he admitted he had \nbeen arrested in November 2017 after his car was rear-ended on the highway, but then \nstated: \nWhile getting checked out in the ambulance, the officer mistakenly thought \nthat I was impaired, though I was not. He took me into the station for a \nsobriety check which I passed and was released because I was not impaired. \nWhen the investigator reached out to me about this incident, it had verbiage \nabout a marijuana possession that I was unaware of. I currently have a \nlawyer looking into this incident. \n6 \n \nAs to why he did not list the incident on his October 2020 e-QIP, Applicant stated \nthat he \u201cadmitted and reported\u201d that he was suspected of DUI on the date in question but \nthat he took a sobriety test and was released. He reiterated that he knew nothing of a \nmarijuana charge at the time. About his failure to disclose his 1992 and 1996 drug arrests \non his e-QIP, Applicant stated that he was unaware that he had \u201cto repeat a topic already \naddressed that fell outside of the 10yr range of the current investigation.\u201d (Item 2). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concerns about drug involvement and substance misuse are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 24: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above. \nIn addition to the above matters, I note that marijuana is a Schedule I controlled \nsubstance under federal law pursuant to Title 21, Section 812 of the United States Code. \nSchedule I drugs are those which have a high potential for abuse; have no currently \naccepted medical use in treatment in the United States; and lack accepted safety for use of \nthe drug under medical supervision. Section 844 under Title 21 of the United States Code \nmakes it unlawful for any person to knowingly or intentionally possess a controlled \nsubstance not obtained pursuant to a valid prescription. \nApplicant admitted on his December 2009 e-QIP and during his February 2010 PSI \nthat he used marijuana in February 2009 while on vacation with his spouse and some \nfriends. He recently claimed in his November 2021 response to interrogatories that he had \nused marijuana only one time, in 2009. With respect to his drug-related arrests in 1992, \n1996, and 2017 that implicate him in the illegal possession if not also the use of controlled \ndrugs on those occasions, Applicant admitted in his January 2022 Answer to the SOR that \nhe used marijuana \u201cup until 2009.\u201d He denies any involvement with marijuana since he \nfailed a urinalysis test in 2009 and completed counseling. \nWith respect to his November 2017 arrest, Applicant has not successfully rebutted \nthe evidence showing that the police seized a metal grinder and illegal drugs (about 2.2 \ngrams of marijuana and 1.3 grams of cocaine) from his vehicle or that he had a smoking \npipe with burnt marijuana residue in his back pocket. The police are presumed to have \nacted in good-faith in reporting what they discovered during their searches. Applicant did \nnot present any evidence that would lead me to question the legitimacy or validity of the \npolice report. Prosecution of the drug charges was not pursued, but it is unclear why, and I \ncannot speculate in that regard. Applicant did not provide any evidence to overcome the \nreasonable inference that he, and not his brother, was involved in the incident. Applicant is \nidentified as the suspect with PII details that match his e-QIP. \nAt the same time, there is no evidence of any involvement by Applicant with illegal \ndrugs after his failed urinalysis around March 2009 until his arrest in November 2017, and \nthere is no evidence of drug involvement by him since November 2017. Even on those \nfacts, the following three disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 apply: \n(a) any substance misuse; \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nAG \u00b6 25(f), \u201cany illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position,\u201d warrants some discussion because of the observations of the \npolice who arrested Applicant in November 2017. The police reported smelling \u201cthe odor of \nburnt marijuana emitting from [Applicant\u2019s] person.\u201d When coupled with the fact that \nApplicant had a marijuana pipe in his rear pocket, the logical inference is that he used \nmarijuana if not immediately before his arrest, then around that time. Whether or not AG \u00b6 \n25(f) is established with respect to use, there is sufficient evidence of illegal drug \npossession while he held a DOD secret clearance to raise the security concerns underlying \nAG \u00b6 25(f) in that persons holding security clearance are expected to comply with the \nfederal drug laws and DOD policy prohibiting illegal drug involvement. \nApplicant bears the burden of establishing that matters in mitigation apply. AG \u00b6 26 \nprovides for mitigation of illegal drug involvement and substance misuse as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non an individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \nillegal drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging \nthat any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness during \nwhich these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including, \nbut not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without \nrecurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical \nprofessional. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) applies in that Applicant\u2019s drug involvement is not recent. His claim that \nhe did not know drugs were involved in his November 2017 arrest lacks credibility. He lied \nwhen he responded to DOHA interrogatories and claimed he used marijuana only in 2009 \nand only one time. His lack of candor about the extent of his drug involvement has serious \nGuideline E implications in this case, but it is not a substitute for record evidence of drug \nuse. In that regard, there is no evidence of any illegal drug use or possession since \nNovember 2017. \nApplicant\u2019s inconsistent representations about his drug involvement also extend to \nhis reported counseling. He denied on his December 2009 e-QIP that he had ever \nattended counseling or been ordered, advised, or asked to attend counseling or treatment \nas a result of his drug use. He subsequently told an OPM investigator in February 2010 \nthat, after he tested positive for marijuana in a random drug screen, his then-employer \nrequired him to attend a drug and alcohol awareness program one day a week for one \nmonth. On his October 2020 e-QIP, Applicant admitted that he had been ordered, advised, \nor asked to seek counseling as a result of his drug use, but he indicated that he attended a \nprogram from March 2009 to November 2009. His illegal possession of drugs and drug \nparaphernalia, if not also use of marijuana in 2017, while he held a security clearance \nundermines the rehabilitative effect of that program, whether it lasted one week or eight \nmonths. He provided no evidence that would satisfy AG \u00b6 26(b)(1), \u201cdisassociation from \ndrug-using associates and contacts.\u201d \nThe Appeal Board recently reiterated that an applicant who uses illegal drugs after \nhaving completed a security clearance application or after otherwise being placed on notice \nof the incompatibility of drug abuse and clearance eligibility raises questions about his \njudgment, reliability, and willingness to comply with rules and regulations. See ISCR Case \nNo. 19-02499 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 7, 2021) citing, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04198 at 2 (App. \nBd. Jan. 15, 2019). Applicant\u2019s possession of marijuana and cocaine in November 2017 \nreflects an unwillingness to comply with laws and regulations. His burden of persuasion \nwith respect to mitigating the Guideline H security concerns is not met by him suggesting \nthat his brother may have been the person involved in the November 2017 drug incident, or \nadmitting that he was detained but not arrested for suspected driving under the influence of \nalcohol. I am concerned that the DOD does not know the full extent of Applicant\u2019s drug \ninvolvement. The drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns are not \nmitigated. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe security concerns about personal conduct are set forth in AG \u00b6 15, which \nprovides: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or \nadjudicative processes. \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use, failed drug test, and drug-related arrests establish the \nsecurity concerns under AG \u00b6 15 and support \u201ca whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment.\u201d The November 2017 incident involving illegal possession of marijuana, cocaine, \nand drug paraphernalia is of particular concern because it occurred while he held a DOD \nsecret clearance. Moreover, the evidence reflects that Applicant omitted the arrests from \nhis October 2020 e-QIP. He denies intentional concealment, claiming with respect to the \nFebruary 1992 and January 1996 charges that he did not realize that he had to list arrest \ninformation reported during his prior investigation that was outside the ten-year scope of \nthe e-QIP, and, with respect to the November 2017 charges, that he \u201cadmitted and \nreported that [he] was suspected of DUI on the date in question.\u201d \nThe Appeal Board has repeatedly held that, to establish a falsification, it is not \nenough merely to demonstrate that an applicant\u2019s answers were not true or accurate. To \nraises security concerns under Guideline E, the responses must be deliberately false. In \nanalyzing an applicant\u2019s intent, the administrative judge must consider an applicant\u2019s \nanswers in light of the record evidence as a whole. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-05005 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 15, 2017). Applicant is alleged to have deliberately falsified the question \ninto whether he had ever been charged with an offense involving alcohol or drugs. Unlike \nsome of the e-QIP inquiries, the question does not have a seven-year scope. Furthermore, \nthere is nothing in the inquiry that informs the applicant that he or she does not have to list \ninformation that occurred before a previous background investigation. While Applicant\u2019s \nexplanation for not listing his 1992 and 1996 charges is plausible, it is difficult to find that \nhe acted in good faith. His claim that he reported the November 2017 incident as a DUI is \nnot substantiated by the documentary evidence. He did not indicate anywhere on his \nOctober 2020 e-QIP that he had been arrested in November 2017. The information about \nhis arrest was developed in the continuous evaluation process. His lack of candor about his \nreason for omitting that offense makes it difficult to accept that his omission of the earlier \noffenses was due to a lack of understanding as to what was required to be reported. AG \u00b6 \n16(a) applies. It provides: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, of award fiduciary responsibilities. \nMoreover, when considered together, Applicant\u2019s arrest record and his efforts at \nconcealment trigger the security concerns set out in AG \u00b6 16(c): \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but \nwhich, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of \nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics \nindicating that the individual may not properly safeguard classified or \nsensitive information. \nThree mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 warrant some discussion. They are: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or \nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur. \nApplicant\u2019s consistent employment with a defense contractor since December 2009 \nweighs in his favor. His 1992 and 1996 arrests occurred more than 25 years ago. While so \nmuch time has passed since those incidents, his arrest in November 2017 precludes \napplication of AG \u00b6 17(c). His denial of any drug-related involvement in the November 2017 \nincident reflects a lack of reform. His e-QIP falsification is not mitigated by either AG \u00b6 \n17(a) nor AG \u00b6 17(d) when he continues to misrepresent his involvement on November \n2017 and falsely claims he reported that he was detained for DUI. The personal conduct \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept  \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \nThe Government must be assured that those persons granted access to classified \ninformation can be counted on to fulfill their responsibilities consistent with laws, \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________ \nregulations, and policies, including federal drug laws and security clearance requirements. \nApplicant raised considerable doubts in that regard by possessing marijuana and cocaine \nin November 2017 and falsely denying that involvement. It is well settled that once a \nconcern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong \npresumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, \n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th  Cir. 1990). For the reasons previously discussed, doubts persist \nas to whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant eligibility for a security clearance for Applicant. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n13 \n",

The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on October 11, 2022. \nThe case was heard on November 3, 2022. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the \nhearing on November 10, 2022. \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were \nadmitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. I marked as Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AE) A and B the two documents Applicant attached to his Answer, and I marked \nas AE C an additional document his attorney submitted during the hearing. (Tr. at 9-13, \n61,) \nProcedural Rulings \nThe Government requested I take administrative notice of certain facts relating to \nthe Republic of Korea (South Korea). Department Counsel provided a five-page summary \nof those facts, supported by nine U.S. Government documents pertaining to South Korea, \nidentified as Administrative Notice - I (AN - I). The documents provide elaboration and \ncontext for the factual summary. I take administrative notice of the facts included in the \nGovernment reports. These facts are limited to matters of general knowledge, not subject \nto reasonable dispute. They are set out in the Findings of Fact. (Tr. at 11.) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 59 years old and was born in South Korea. He was adopted by \nrelatives in the United States when he was four years old and became a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen at age eight. His adoptive father was a member of the U.S. Army, and Applicant \nmoved with his family to various locations around the world.

He and his wife plan to retire in Texas \nas well. He is also considering moving to Texas earlier and working at his current job \nremotely from Texas. (Answer at 3; Tr. at 17-23, 43-44; GE 1 at 1-2, 17-20, 21-25, 43; \nGE 2 at 9, 16; GE 3 at 8-10.) \nApplicant first received a Secret security clearance in 1984 in connection with his \nmilitary service. His most recent reinvestigation was in 2011. He has worked in South \nKorea for two U.S. defense contractors since his discharge from the Army (2006-2017 \nand 2017 to present). He is currently working as a manager. He seeks to receive eligibility \nfor a Top Secret security clearance in connection with his employment. He has resided in \nSouth Korea since at least 2006. (Tr. at 29-31; GE 1 at 12-13; GE 2 at 10-11; GE 3 at 8-\n9.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline B, Foreign Influence) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has foreign connections that may create a security concern. The SOR alleges \nin three subparagraphs that Applicant\u2019s wife and her parents are citizens and residents \nof South Korea. In his Answer Applicant admitted these factual allegations, denied that \nthe facts raise security concerns, and provided detailed explanations. \nApplicant\u2019s wife was born in South Korea in 1975. Her father and mother were born \nin South Korea in 1945. Her father served in the South Korean Army for 25 years and \nretired with the rank of lieutenant colonel. He then worked for the Korean Institute for \nDefense Analysis, or KIDA, for about ten years until his retirement in 2006. Applicant \ndescribed the KIDA as a think tank for the South Korean Army. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law \nis presently 77 years old. His mother-in-law is a retired nurse. For a period during the \nVietnam War, she served as a nurse in the South Korean Army and was deployed to \nVietnam. She later worked as a nurse in a civilian hospital in South Korea. Applicant has \nregular contact with his wife\u2019s parents over the phone, and his family visits his in-laws \nevery couple of months and during Korean holidays. His parents-in-law live about three \nhours from Applicant\u2019s residence in South Korea. (Answer at 6; Tr. at 23-29, 58-59; GE 3 \nat 11.) \nApplicant owns no property in South Korea and has no expectation that his wife \nwill inherit anything from her parents. Applicant\u2019s sole sources of income are his salary \nfrom his U.S. DOD contractor, his U.S. military retirement payments, and his Veteran\u2019s \nAdministration disability benefits. He is financially secure. His parents-in-law are \nfinancially independent. He provides no financial support to them.

Accordingly, it is appropriate to look at \nthe current conditions in that country. South Korea is a constitutional democracy; whose \nauthorities generally respect the human rights of its citizens. Human rights concerns exist, \nparticularly in the areas of restrictions of freedom of expression and the government\u2019s \nresponses to violence against women. Civilian authorities maintain effective control over \nthe country\u2019s security forces, and the government utilizes effective mechanisms to \ninvestigate and punish any abuses of power. South Korea and companies in South Korea \nare active collectors of U.S. industrial information and engage in industrial espionage, as \nshown by the administrative notice documents in the record. However, the record does \nnot demonstrate that the South Korean government seeks to exert pressure on U.S. \ncitizens to collect sensitive information. Finally, a U.S. Government website describes the \nclose and continuing relationship between the U.S. military and South Korea and its \nmilitary. Large numbers of U.S. ground, air, sea, and special operations forces cooperate \njointly with the South Korean military under a common command to protect the security \nof South Korea. (AN-I; www.usfk.mil.) \nParagraph 2 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file his Federal income tax returns for tax \nyears (TY) 2017, 2018, and 2019, as required. In his Answer Applicant denies the \nallegations though he admits that he failed to request extensions of time to file. He \nprovided IRS tax account transcripts for the three years in dispute. The evidence reflects \nthat Applicant filed his TY 2017 tax return on April 22, 2019, over one year late. The \nGovernment issued a refund of $4,200 to Applicant. In October 2020 the IRS prepared a \nsubstitute tax return due to Applicant\u2019s failure to file his TY 2018 return on time. He \nultimately filed a return in about February 2021. Applicant had a negative balance of \n$1,416 for this tax year, indicating that he owed no additional taxes. Applicant also filed \nhis TY 2019 tax return late. The account transcript reflects a filing date of June 2021. The \nIRS issued a refund to Applicant for that tax year in the amount of $2,468. (AE A through \nAE C.) \nAt the hearing Applicant blamed his untimely filing of his Federal tax returns on his \nignorance and neglect. He also said that he experienced difficulties receiving the requisite \npaperwork from his employer after he changed employers in 2017 and with his wife\u2019s tax \nidentification number (TIN), which had expired. The renewal of her TIN required \ndocumentation and he had difficulty communicating with the IRS. Also, his job change \nrequired that he relocate his family within South Korea, and he had to withdraw funds \nfrom his 401k account to finance the relocation. That withdrawal further complicated his \ntax returns and delayed his preparation of the returns. Based upon his past experience \nwith his taxes, he knew that he did not owe the IRS any additional taxes, so he did not \nbelieve a delay in filing would be a problem. He admitted that he was ignorant of the legal \nrequirements relating to the timely filing of tax returns. He had no intention not to file his \nreturns, and in fact, he did file his returns.

As of the close of the record, Applicant had filed all the required \nFederal income tax returns and did not owe any Federal taxes. (Tr. at 49-57, 59-60.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information.\nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under\nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest\nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d\nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline B, Foreign Influence) \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in AG \n\u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Three are arguably applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant lives with his wife in South Korea. His wife\u2019s parents are also citizens \nand residents of South Korea. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law served as an officer in the South \nKorean Army and worked for a South Korean national security institute thereafter until his \nretirement in 2006. Applicant has daily contact with his wife and regular contact with his \nwife\u2019s parents. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nSouth Korea and South Korean companies are active collectors of U.S. \ntechnology. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s family connections in that country have the potential \nto generate a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, \nor coercion under AG \u00b6 7(a). The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a \nforeign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if \nonly one relative lives in a foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, \nthis factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could \npotentially result in the compromise of classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8, including: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nApplicant is a U.S. citizen who was raised by U.S. parents following his adoption \nas a young child. His three children are also American citizens. His oldest child resides \nand works in the United States. Applicant intends to have his two younger children attend \ncollege in the U.S. Applicant and his wife also intend to retire in the United States. \nApplicant served in the Army for about 22 years and has worked for DOD contractors \nsince his discharge from the military in 2006. He has successfully held a security \nclearance since 1984. AG \u00b6 8(c) is not established because Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts \nare frequent and are not casual. On the other hand, Applicant\u2019s personal, professional, \nand family connections in the United States strongly outweigh his connections to South \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKorea. There is no conflict of interest. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and (b) apply and fully mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised by the facts of this case. Paragraph 1 is found for Applicant. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set out in \nAG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nApplicant failed to file his Federal income tax returns, as required, for TYs 2017 \nthrough 2019. These facts establish the foregoing disqualifying conditions and shift the \nburden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes two conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file tax returns: \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s delay in filing his TY 2017 through 2019 tax returns was caused by his \nlack of understanding of his legal obligations. He believed that he had overpaid his taxes \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand was due refunds in each year, which proved to be correct. He also encountered some \npractical difficulties in receiving the necessary documentation and the renewal of his \nwife\u2019s TIN. He has received counseling for the problem from his attorney, a legitimate and \ncredible source. Applicant has filed all his Federal income tax returns and owed no \nFederal taxes through TY 2021. There are clear indications that Applicant will timely file \nhis tax returns in the future. The above Guideline F mitigating conditions fully apply. \nParagraph 2 is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s potential for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has mitigated the \nconcerns raised by his wife\u2019s citizenship and residency in South Korea as well as the \ncitizenship and residency of her parents in that country. Applicant\u2019s lifelong commitment \nto and experiences with the U.S. military, even as a child living overseas as an Army \ndependent, demonstrate his strong ties and interests in the United States. Also, he has \nlearned that his casual attitude about complying with the Federal tax-filing requirements \nwas inappropriate and will not be repeated. Overall, the record evidence does not create \nany questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national security eligibility \nand a security clearance. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance.

Based on the \nresults of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA \nCAF) could not, as required by Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Section E.4, \nand by DOD Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive), Section 4.2, make an affirmative \ndetermination that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security for \nApplicant to continue to have access to classified information. \nOn November 15, 2021, the DCSA CAF issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts and security concerns addressed under Guideline F (Financial \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConsiderations). The adjudicative guideline (AG) cited in the SOR was one of the \nguidelines issued by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) on December 10, 2016, to \nbe effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a decision without \na hearing. On December 20, 2021, as provided for by paragraph E3.1.7 of the Directive, \nDepartment Counsel for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM) that was received by Applicant on September 22, 2021. \nThe FORM contained six exhibits (Items 1 \u2013 6) on which the Government relies to support \nthe SOR allegations. \nApplicant received the FORM on February 4, 2022, and was informed he had 30 \ndays from receipt of the FORM to submit additional information. He did not submit \nanything further and the record closed on March 6, 2022. I received the case for decision \non April 12, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant owes $31,428 for six past-due \nor delinquent debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.f). In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the \nGuideline F allegations. (FORM, Items 1 and 3) In addition to the facts established by \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 31 years old and is sponsored for a security clearance by his employer, \na federal contractor. In his most recent e-QIP, he disclosed that he owed $35,171 for six \ndelinquent or past-due debts. A credit report obtained by government investigators in \nMarch 2021 documented those and other delinquencies about which Applicant was \ninterviewed by a government investigator on June 3, 2021. During the interview, Applicant \nattributed his financial problems to his employer\u2019s decision to stop allowing overtime, on \nwhich Applicant relied to make an extra $5 hourly. When he was able to earn that extra \nincome, he could make at least the minimum payments on the commercial credit accounts \nlisted in the SOR. He did not otherwise explain why or how he incurred numerous credit \naccounts with high balances. Based on my review of all of the available information, I \nconclude that Applicant was living beyond his means when his access to overtime pay \nended. (FORM, Items 4 \u2013 6) \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant asserted that he had resolved one account and \nwas paying off another debt that was not one of those alleged in the SOR. (FORM, Item \n3) He has not provided any information in response to the SOR or the FORM that would \nsupport that claim. Applicant also did not provide any information about his current \nfinances or about any efforts to resolve the debts documented by the Government\u2019s \ninformation.  \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those \nfactors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988)) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAvailable information shows that Applicant owes more than $31,000 for six \ndelinquent debts that he has not yet addressed or resolved. His debts became delinquent \nbecause he was living beyond his means. This information reasonably raises the security \nconcerns articulated, in relevant part, at AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \nMore specifically, the Government\u2019s information requires application of the \nfollowing AG \u00b6 19 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(e) consistent spending beyond one's means or frivolous or irresponsible \nspending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other \nnegative financial indicators. \nI also have considered the following pertinent AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nThe Government\u2019s information presented a prima facie case for disqualification. \nAccordingly, it was incumbent on Applicant to present sufficient reliable information on \nwhich application of available mitigating conditions could be based. He did not do so. The \nrecord does not support any of the cited mitigating conditions. Applicant did not meet his \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n \n \n \nburden of persuasion to overcome the Government\u2019s case for disqualification from access \nto classified information. \nIn addition to my evaluation of the facts and application of the appropriate \nadjudicative factors under Guideline F, I have reviewed the record before me in the \ncontext of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). The record evidence as a whole \npresents unresolved doubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified \ninformation. His ongoing financial problems leave him at risk of engaging in unacceptable \nconduct to resolve his debts. Further, his apparent lack of action in addressing his \nfinancial problems reflects adversely on his judgment and reliability. Because protection \nof the national interest is the principal focus in these adjudications, any remaining doubts \nmust be resolved against allowing access to sensitive information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all available information, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request \nfor security clearance eligibility is denied. \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n5 \n",

As \ndiscussed Applicant and her husband filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2011. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a \u2013 1.p) Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations in her November 15, 2021 SOR \nAnswer.  \nFollowing their 2011 Chapter 7 bankruptcy, Applicant and her husband were able \nto remain current on their bills until her husband\u2019s 2016 stroke. It took \u201calmost two \nyears\u201d before the Social Security Administration (SSA) approved her husband\u2019s \ndisability claim. He receives $2,083 in monthly disability payments. Applicant\u2019s annual \nsalary is \u201c[a]bout $70,000.\u201d (Tr. 20, 22-23) \nDepartment Counsel and I reviewed each of Applicant\u2019s SOR debts with her. \nApplicant has not made any effort to contact, pay, or set up a payment plan with any of \nher creditors. (Tr. 24-44) Applicant explained that given her current income and the \nneed to continue helping her middle daughter in drug rehabilitation, she simply does not \nhave the money to pay any of her creditors. Added to that, Applicant\u2019s father passed \naway in 2013 and her mother moved in with her shortly after. Applicant has found her \nsituation so overwhelming that she has not looked into debt consolidation or bankruptcy. \nShe has not had any financial counseling since her 2011 Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Apart \nfrom her SOR debts, Applicant is current on her living expenses. (Tr. 44-45, 59) \nApplicant\u2019s take-home pay is $1,500 every two weeks, for a total of $3,000 a \nmonth. With her husband\u2019s $2,083 SSA disability pay, that brings their monthly net total \nto $5,083. She and her husband own a single-family four-bedroom home with a monthly \nmortgage is $3,585. After paying her mortgage she has a balance of $1,498 to pay all of \nher other living expenses such as her husband\u2019s $750 monthly truck payment, utilities, \ngroceries, gasoline, and helping out her middle daughter. Applicant stated, \u201cThat\u2019s why \nit just felt overwhelming to me.\u201d Applicant has no money left over at the end of the \nmonth and has no savings. She has a small 401k that she contributes to from her \npaycheck. Her husband has no other source of income other than his monthly disability \npayments. (Tr. 46-51) \nApplicant stated that she considered various options to regain financial stability \nsuch as liquidating her 401k and consulting a credit counselor.

SIL \ndescribed Applicant overall as a \u201cgreat person.\u201d SIL is familiar with all of the challenges \nthat Applicant has faced over the past ten years to include her husband\u2019s stroke, her \nmother passing, and her middle daughter\u2019s drug addiction. SIL stated that she would \ndiscuss options with Applicant to regain financial responsibility. (Tr. 53-57, 62) \nApplicant submitted work performance reviews from 2018 to 2021. It is clear from \nthe reviews that Applicant is a highly regarded and valued employee. (AE A \u2013 AE D) \nShe submitted six work-related reference letters. Her supervisors and co-workers have \na very high opinion of her and describe her as hard working with a strong work ethic, \nhonest, dependable, trustworthy, and helpful. All of these individuals recommend that \nApplicant be allowed to keep her clearance. (AE E \u2013 AE J) Her employer also gave her \na Spotlight Award in September 2021 and a Mission Excellence Award in April 2021. \n(AE K, AE L) \nConclusion \nAt the end of Applicant\u2019s hearing, I discussed keeping the record open to afford \nher the opportunity to submit additional mitigating evidence. Her SIL stated she would \nassist her in evaluating and pursuing her options. (Tr. 60-65) Post-hearing, Applicant \nforwarded an email to me thanking me for keeping the record open. She informed me \nthat she looked into various options to regain financial responsibility and none of those \noptions were feasible for her at this time. She concluded saying that she is a very \nhonest and trustworthy person and would never jeopardize her job that she has worked \nvery hard to obtain and maintain for the last 14 years.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2, describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a clearance favorable \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \n5 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the \nburden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not \nresponsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \nId. (internal citation omitted). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d The record established the disqualifying conditions in \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \nmitigating conditions. Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the \nmitigation section, infra.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists seven potential mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nIn summary, no mitigating conditions fully apply. In addition to evaluating the \nfacts and applying the appropriate adjudicative factors under Guideline F, I have \nreviewed the record before me in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 \n2(d). Applicant has been gainfully employed for the majority of her adult life, and she is \npresumed to be a mature, responsible citizen. Nonetheless, without other information \nsuggesting her long-standing financial problems are being addressed, doubts remain \nabout her suitability for access to classified information. Protection of the national \ninterest is the principal focus of these adjudications. According, those doubts must be \nresolved against Applicant. \nWhile the debts alleged in the SOR arguably resulted in large part from \ncircumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control due to her husband\u2019s stroke and disability, \nher middle daughter\u2019s rehabilitation costs, and her mother moving into her home, that is \nonly half of the analysis and Applicant\u2019s response to her financial problems must be the \nsecond consideration. Applicant was unable to submit sufficient evidence to supplement \nthe record with relevant and material evidence to mitigate the financial security \nconcerns. There is no evidence that she maintained contact with her creditors after her \n15 accounts when she was unable to make her payments. She did not pursue financial \ncounseling or other avenues of regaining financial responsibility. By failing to provide \nsuch information, financial considerations security concerns remain. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot \nor will not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the \nfuture. Applicant is a hard-working and intelligent individual. With more effort towards \ndocumented resolution of her past-due debts, and a better track record of behavior \nconsistent with her obligations, she may well be able to demonstrate persuasive \nevidence of her security clearance worthiness. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.p: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Since then, he has held several positions with the federal contractor while holding \na clearance. \nApplicant took a $20,000 home improvement loan in 2011, and defaulted on the \nloan in 2017. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) He failed to explain what circumstances, if any, prevented him \nfrom making the loan payments. On October 26, 2021, Applicant contacted the lender \nand established a new payment schedule of $77 per month, and made one payment that \nmonth. He established this payment agreement after his June 2020 interview with an \nOPM investigator, but before the SOR was issued on November 5, 2021. His payment \nhistory shows that he made a $154 payment on November 2, 2021, and consecutive \nmonthly payments of $77 from December 2021 until July 21, 2022. (See HE 1) \nConcerning the defaulted education loan (SOR \u00b6 1.b), Applicant explained he co\u00ad\nsigned the loan for his stepdaughter and she defaulted. After the creditor asked him to \nrepay the loan, he settled the account for less, and paid it. The creditor provided him with \na document indicating he was \u201cfully released\u201d from any further obligation as of May 2017. \n(See documents attached to SOR answer.) \nIn Section 26 (Financial Record) of his 2020 SCA, Applicant failed to disclose the \ntwo accounts alleged in the SOR. He answered \u201cNo\u201d to the financial questions asking \nwhether in the last seven years he had an account turned over to a collection agency, \nhad been over 120 days delinquent on any debt, or was currently over 120 days \ndelinquent on any debt. Because of the two delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR, \nApplicant should have answered \u201cYes\u201d to all three questions with respect to the home \nimprovement loan, and \u201cYes\u201d to the first two questions concerning the defaulted student \nloan. If he resolved the education loan in 2017, then the education loan was not 120 days \ndelinquent when he completed the SCA. \nDuring his June 2020 background interview, Applicant volunteered that his \nstepdaughter defaulted on the student loan. He did not disclose his defaulted home \nimprovement loan until the investigator confronted him about it. \nIn his answer to the SOR, and in his response to the FORM, Applicant stated that \nhis failure to list the two debts was an oversight and not an attempt to deceive or withhold \ninformation. In his defense and in mitigation, Applicant highlighted his over 20 years of \nmilitary service on active duty in the Air Force, his honorable discharge, and his over eight \nyears of service for a large federal contractor supporting the U.S. military. He believes his \nrecord demonstrates he is a man of integrity, honor, and of strong moral fiber. He claimed \nhis military and civilian records reflect no blemishes or negative entries, and demonstrate \nhe has been successful. Since he was hired in 2014, Applicant was promoted twice and \ncurrently holds a managerial position. \nApplicant presented no evidence to show he has participated in financial \ncounseling or has a working budget. He did not present evidence of his current financial \nsituation (gross monthly income, deductions, monthly expenses, and monthly net \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nremainder). Without any documentary evidence of his current financial situation, it is not \npossible for me to assess whether he is financially overextended. \nThe only glimpse at Applicant\u2019s current financial situation arises from a review of \nhis 2021 credit bureau report (CBR). (Item 4) Except for the two accounts alleged in the \nSOR, he has no other delinquent accounts. The CBR shows 20 accounts (trades) with \n\u201c0\u201d balance; three student loans totaling $28,357; and 13 open accounts with an \naggregate balance of about $535,415, which include nine credit-card or revolving-charge \naccounts, two mortgages, three auto loans, and two unsecured loans. \nApplicant did not report any adverse information under the SCA financial \nquestions. He denied he deliberately falsified or withheld information from his 2020 SCA \nabout his finances. After considering all of the evidence, including Applicant\u2019s age, \neducation, experience, honorable military service, and service for a federal contractor, I \nfind he did not intentionally provide false information or conceal his finances on the SF \n86. \nPolicies \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017. \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The \nU.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in \nregulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno one \nhas a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 \n(1988). \nThe AGs list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition \nis not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AGs should be followed where a case can be \nmeasured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to classified \ninformation. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration \nof the whole person and the factors listed in Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) \n4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and 2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and \npresent, favorable and unfavorable, must be considered. [First time SEAD used] \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling \ninterest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. The \u201cclearly \nconsistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt \nabout an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. \nat 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance decisions are not \na determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are merely an indication \nthat the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the Government has established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . ..  \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are documented in the record. He had two \ndelinquent debts that were charged off. AG \u00b6 19 provides disqualifying conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy \ndebts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d The record established \nthese disqualifying conditions, requiring additional inquiry about the applicability of \nmitigating conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nApplicant apparently resolved the delinquent student loan in 2017, before the SOR \nwas issued in November 2021. He established a payment plan in October 2021 to resolve \nthe charged-off loan, and made nine consecutive payments in accordance with his \nagreement. \nOn balance, when considered in light of the record as a whole, I find that the \nevidence is insufficient to establish that Applicant was financially responsible under the \ncircumstances. He took the home improvement loan in 2011 and defaulted on it in 2017. \nHe failed to present any evidence to explain what caused him to default on the loan, or \nwhat actions he took to resolve the loan between 2017 and October 2021, when he \nestablished his payment agreement. He presented no evidence of efforts to contact the \ncreditor, to establish a payment plan, or of any payments made between 2017 and \nOctober 2021. \nThe record evidence leaves me with doubts and concerns about Applicant\u2019s \ncurrent financial situation. He presented no evidence to show he has participated in \nfinancial counseling or has a working budget. He did not present evidence of his current \nfinancial situation (gross monthly income, deductions, monthly expenses, and monthly \nnet remainder). Without any documentary evidence of his current financial situation, it is \nnot possible for me to assess whether he is financially overextended. \nApplicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to establish mitigation of the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. It does not establish that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances, or that he made a good-faith effort to resolve his financial problems. \nThis is not his first clearance application. He knew or should have known that he is \nrequired to establish and maintain financial responsibility to be eligible for a clearance. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant did not report any adverse information under the financial questions on \nhis April 2020 SF 86. After considering all of the evidence, including Applicant\u2019s age, \neducation, experience, honorable military service, and service for a federal contractor, I \nfind he did not intentionally falsify the SF 86. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not applicable. Personal \nconduct security concerns are concluded for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person concept. \nSEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). Under AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of \nwhether to grant a security clearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My \ncomments under Guideline F and E are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some \nof the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline but some warrant \nadditional comment. \nApplicant, 49, receives favorable credit for his honorable, active duty service in the \nAir Force, and for his good work as a federal contractor. He also receives favorable credit \nfor resolving one of the accounts alleged in the SOR. Notwithstanding, the limited \nevidence he presented in the FORM is insufficient to erase all doubts about his financial \nsituation and to establish that his finances are under control. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. This decision should not be construed as a \ndetermination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for \naward of a security clearance in the future. If Applicant satisfactory explains his current \nfinancial situation, a security clearance eligibility could be in his future. Financial \nconsiderations security concerns are not mitigated at this time. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a : \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant or \ncontinue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with extensive comments, the factual allegations pertaining to drug involvement and substance misuse (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.c.). Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: Background Applicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a project manager with his current employer since February 2007. A 1996 high school graduate, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2000. He has never served with the U.S. military. He has never been married. He has never been granted a security clearance. Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse Applicant was a recreational multi-substance abuser whose substances of choice during a 25-year period were tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), known as marijuana [used with varying frequency from about March 1997 to at least December 2020, and apparently until the present time; and psilocybin mushrooms, called magic mushrooms, [used from about August 1997 to at least December 2002] \u2013 both Schedule I Controlled Substances; and alprazolam (the prescription medication Xanax\u00ae which was not prescribed for him) [used from about January 2018 to at least May 2021 \u2013 a Schedule IV Controlled Substance.

Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 15, 2020, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). On an unspecified date, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued him a set of interrogatories, and \nalso asked him to verify the accuracy of an investigator\u2019s summary of an interview. He \nresponded to those interrogatories and verified the summary on October 15, 2021. On \nDecember 13, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \nand modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG), effective June 8, \n2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline H (drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse) and detailed reasons why the DCSA CAF adjudicators were unable \nto find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nIn a sworn statement, dated January 4, 2022, Applicant responded to the SOR and \nelected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete \ncopy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by \nDOHA on February 18, 2022, and he was afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 \ndays, to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In \naddition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the \nAdjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received the FORM on March \n11, 2022. His response was due on April 10, 2022. Applicant chose not to respond to the \nFORM, for as of April 26, 2022, no response had been received. The case was assigned \nto me on May 13, 2022. The record closed on April 10, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with extensive comments, the \nfactual allegations pertaining to drug involvement and substance misuse (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \nthrough 1.c.). Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration \nof same, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a project manager with his current employer since February 2007. A 1996 high school \ngraduate, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2000. He has never served with the U.S. \nmilitary. He has never been married. He has never been granted a security clearance. \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nApplicant was a recreational multi-substance abuser whose substances of choice \nduring a 25-year period were tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), known as marijuana [used with \nvarying frequency from about March 1997 to at least December 2020, and apparently \nuntil the present time; and psilocybin mushrooms, called magic mushrooms, [used from \nabout August 1997 to at least December 2002] \u2013 both Schedule I Controlled Substances; \nand alprazolam (the prescription medication Xanax\u00ae which was not prescribed for him) \n[used from about January 2018 to at least May 2021 \u2013 a Schedule IV Controlled \nSubstance. (Item 2; Item 3; Item 4; (https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/; 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 812 (c)) He purchased the marijuana he used from a legal dispensary licensed \nby the state since 2019, and before that, he obtained it from illegal sources. (Item 3 at 26; \nItem 4, at 8) His purchase and use of magic mushrooms was not alleged in the SOR. \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn his SF 86, Applicant reported that he had smoked marijuana on a daily basis \nrecreationally, as well as to fend off panic attacks, anxiety, and stress. (Item 3 at 24-25) \nHe used magic mushrooms, without reporting either a frequency or a reason for such use. \n(Item 3 at 25) He also used Xanax\u00ae during extremely stressful circumstances, but failed \nto identify such circumstances or report the frequency for such use. (Item 3 at 25) \nApplicant expanded on his history of drug involvement and substance misuse \nduring an interview with an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management \n(OPM) on December 1, 2020. During that interview, he reported smoking one or two bowls \nof marijuana on a daily basis, either with friends whom he refused to identify, or by himself \nat home. He also refused to identify the individual(s) from whom he illegally purchased \nthe marijuana before 2019. (Item 4 at 8) He reported that he \u201cexperimented\u201d with magic \nmushrooms on eight occasions during concerts and social gatherings, essentially to be \nsocial. He refused to identify those friends as well as the individual(s) from whom he \nillegally purchased the magic mushrooms. (Item 4 at 9) He also reported that he used \none 50 mg. of Xanax\u00ae about twelve times a year to deal with panic attacks. The drug was \nnot prescribed for him, but was provided by a friend whom he refused to identify. (Item 4 \nat 9-10) \nApplicant\u2019s future intentions regarding his use of certain identified drugs or \ncontrolled substances differs depending on the substance. With respect to marijuana and \nthe Xanax\u00ae, in his SF 86, he admitted that he intended to use both substances in the \nfuture. (Item 3 at 24-25) He claimed to have no intention of using magic mushroom in the \nfuture. (Item 3 at 25) During his OPM interview, he essentially repeated those future \nintentions with one caveat: if his future use of Xanax\u00ae became an issue, he would seek \nassistance from a healthcare provider to obtain it legally. (Item 4 at 10) In his Answer to \nthe SOR, he repeated those intentions. He argued that his candor and honesty in \nrevealing his intent to continue using marijuana should be proof of his trustworthiness. He \nadded that marijuana use is legal where he uses it. (Item 2) Applicant has never received \ndrug-counseling or treatment. (Item 4 at 8-9) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)).  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994).) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and Substance \nAbuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nFurthermore, on October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) \nissued Memorandum ES 2014-00674, Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana \nUse, which states: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (Reference H and I). An individual's disregard of federal law \npertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations. As always, \nadjudicative authorities are expected to evaluate claimed or developed use \nof, or involvement with, marijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. \nThe adjudicative authority must determine if the use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana raises questions about the individual's judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and willingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, \nincluding federal laws, when making eligibility decisions of persons \nproposed for, or occupying, sensitive national security positions. \nIn addition, on December 21, 2021, the DNI issued Memorandum ES 2021-01529, \nSecurity Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies \nConducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, which states in part: \n. . . disregard of federal law pertaining to marijuana remains relevant, but \nnot determinative, to adjudications of eligibility for access to classified \ninformation or eligibility to hold a sensitive position. . . . \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, in light of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting \nillegal drug use while occupying a sensitive position or holding a security \nclearance, agencies are encouraged to advise prospective national security \nworkforce employees that they should refrain from any future marijuana use \nupon initiation of the national security vetting process, which commences \nonce the individual signs the certification contained in the Standard Form \n86 . . ., Questionnaire for National Security Positions. \nAs discussed by the DOHA Appeal Board, conduct not alleged in an SOR (in this \ncase, his purchase and use of magic mushrooms) may be considered: (a) to assess an \napplicant's credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant's evidence of extenuation, mitigation, \nor changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated \nsuccessful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative \nGuidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis under \nDirective \u00a7 6.3. (See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006); (citing ISCR \nCase No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. \nOct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. April 6, 2016) (citing \nISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). Applicant\u2019s purchase and use of magic mushrooms will be \nconsidered only for the five purposes listed above. \nThe guideline notes some conditions under AG \u00b6 25 that could raise security \nconcerns in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including. . . purchase. . . ;  \nand \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant was admittedly a recreational multi-substance abuser of two Schedule I \nand Schedule IV Controlled Substances. He frequently purchased marijuana and \ncontinues to use it on a daily basis as he has for the last 25 years; and used the \nprescription medication Xanax\u00ae, which was not prescribed for him, for three and one-half \nyears, ending in May 2021. He intends to continue using marijuana, but indicated that in \norder to continue using Xanax\u00ae, he would seek a prescription for it. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), \nand 25(g) have been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 26 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. After approximately 25 years of regular \nmulti-substance drug involvement and substance misuse, and despite knowing that there \nare serious security clearance eligibility concerns regarding such drug involvement, \nApplicant intends to continue using marijuana in the future. It is significant that he was \ncandid about his use of illegal substances when he completed his SF 86 and during his \nOPM interview, and for that candor, he is given some credit. While he has acknowledged \nhis drug involvement, he has refused to identify those from whom he purchased his illegal \ndrug(s), or those with whom he used the illegal drugs. He has never undergone drug \ntreatment and therapy or changed or avoided the environment where the drugs were \nused. Because he refused to identify certain individuals involved in his drug involvement, \nhe has precluded evidence that he has disassociated from drug-using associates and \ncontacts. The above factors continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006)) \nThere is some evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 43-year-old \nemployee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a project manager with his \ncurrent employer since February 2007. A 1996 high school graduate, he received a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2000. When completing his SF 86, he was candid in acknowledging \nthat he had used a variety of illegal substances. When questioned by an OPM \ninvestigator, he was again candid regarding his illegal drug involvement and substance \nmisuse. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant was admittedly a recreational multi-substance abuser of two Schedule I and \nSchedule IV Controlled Substances. He frequently purchased marijuana and continues \nto use it on a daily basis as he has for the past 25 years; and used the prescription \nmedication Xanax\u00ae, which was not prescribed for him, for three and one-half years, \nending in May 2021. He also \u201cexperimented\u201d using magic mushrooms on eight occasions \nduring concerts and social gatherings, essentially to be social. He intends to continue \nusing marijuana. His refusal to furnish full information regarding the sources of his drug \npurchases or the identity of his drug-using friends; the absence of any drug-counseling \nor treatment; his apparent refusal to disassociate himself from his drug-using associates \nby failing to identify them; and his intentions regarding future marijuana use, continue to \ncast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his drug \ninvolvement and substance abuse. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) (1) through AG 2(d) (9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                    \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He is 52 years old. \nHe married in 1995, divorced in 2000, and remarried in 2004. He has three children, two \nadults and a minor. A fourth child is deceased. Applicant obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree \nin 1991 and a master\u2019s degree in 1999. He took pre-med classes from 2000 to 2003, in \nanticipation of attending medical school. As of his July 2020 security clearance \napplication (SCA), he had worked as a senior software engineer for his employer since \nJuly 2017. He also worked part time as a self-employed senior software engineer for his \nown company since October 2009. He was granted a security clearance in 2017. He \nhas owned his home since June 2014. (Items 1, 2, 5) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file his federal and state income tax \nreturns, as required, for tax years (TY) 2013 through 2017, and that his federal and \nstate income tax returns for TY 2013 through 2015 remained unfiled as of the date of \nthe SOR. In addition to his admissions in his Answer, Applicant disclosed and discussed \nhis failure to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for TY 2013 through \n2017 on his SCA and during his August 2020 background interview, and this information \nis also reported in IRS and state tax account transcripts from August 2021. (Items 1-5) \nApplicant attributed his failure to file his relevant federal and state income tax \nreturns to the advice he received from his certified public accountant (CPA), in 2018, \nthat it was unnecessary for him to file his federal and state income tax returns for TY \n2013 and 2014, because he would have been due a refund had he timely filed, and he \nforfeited his refunds since three years had lapsed. He also cited to his mother\u2019s illness \nand passing in early 2018 as factors that contributed to his delay in filing his relevant \nincome tax returns. He also acknowledged that he delayed and procrastinated providing \nnecessary tax documentation to his CPA, so that his CPA could file his relevant federal \nand state income tax returns. (Items 1, 2, 5; AE A) \nIRS and state tax account transcripts reflect that Applicant: (1) had not filed his \nfederal and state income tax returns for TY 2013, 2014, and 2015 as of August 2021; \n(2) filed his federal income tax returns for TY 2016 and 2017 in May 2019, and he had a \nzero account balance for those tax years; and (3) filed his state income tax returns for \nTY 2016, 2017, and 2018 in April 2019, and no further action was required on his part. \nThe IRS tax account transcripts also reflect that Applicant was given an extension, until \nOctober 2017, to file his federal income tax return for TY 2016, and he did not request \nan extension to file his federal income tax return for TY 2017.

He would have been due federal refunds of \n$3,426, $6,460, and $2,587, and state refunds of $958, $1,154, and $1,069, for TY \n2013, 2014, and 2015, respectively. (Items 1-4; AE A) \nApplicant described his financial status as \u201cgood\u201d during his background \ninterview. He indicated that his failure to timely file his relevant income tax returns did \nnot contribute to other financial problems. He indicated that he intended to timely file his \nincome tax returns in the future and that he learned his lesson, became more \norganized, and was more attentive to the deadline for filing his income tax returns. (Item \n5) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Section 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. AG \u00b6 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or \nlocal income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired\u201d applies. Applicant failed to file, as required, his federal and state income tax \nreturns for TY 2013 through 2017. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 and find the \nfollowing relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and, \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant acknowledged that he delayed and procrastinated in providing \nnecessary tax documentation to his CPA so that his CPA could timely file his relevant \nfederal and state income tax returns. His reliance on his CPA\u2019s advice did not occur \nuntil 2018, when he was already delinquent in filing his federal and state income tax \nreturns for TY 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016. While Applicant indicated that his mother\u2019s \nillness and passing in early 2018 affected his ability to timely file his federal and state \nincome tax returns for TY 2016 and 2017, the IRS gave him an extension, until \nOctober 2017, to file his federal income tax returns for TY 2016, and he did not request \nan extension to file his federal income tax returns for TY 2017. He did not file his \nfederal and state income tax returns for TY 2016 and 2017 until 2019, and he did not \nfile his federal and state income tax returns for TY 2013, 2014, and 2015 until February \n2022, several months after the SOR. I find that Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file his \nfederal and state income tax returns for TY 2013 through 2017 continues to cast doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), \n20(c), and 20(g) are not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

The case was assigned to me on March 8, 2022, and the \nhearing was scheduled for April 28, 2022. I convened the hearing as scheduled. On May \n2, 2022, I notified Department Counsel that I intended to issue a summary disposition in \nApplicant\u2019s favor, and he did not object. \nApplicant was born in Afghanistan. He was employed in the U.S. Embassy in Kabul \nfrom September 2009 to July 2014 and was highly regarded by senior members of the \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nembassy staff. He has been employed by a federal contractor since November 2020. He \nhas been offered a position by a contractor supporting a U.S. government agency, \ncontingent on obtaining a security clearance. \nApplicant and his wife came to the United States in September 2014 on special \nimmigrant visas. They purchased a home in 2018. They both became U.S. citizens in \nJune 2020. Applicant\u2019s parents and daughter live with him in the United States. \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens and residents of \nAfghanistan. They are farmers.

On January 26, 2022, Department Counsel indicated that the Government was \nready to proceed to a hearing. On February 24, 2022, the case was assigned to me to \ndetermine whether it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or \ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant. I received the case file and assignment on \nMarch 1, 2022. After some coordination with the parties, on June 13, 2022, I scheduled a \nvideo teleconference hearing for June 28, 2022. \nAt the hearing convened as scheduled, four Government exhibits (GEs 1-4) and \nnine Applicant exhibits (AEs A-I) were admitted into the record without objection. A January \n26, 2022 letter forwarding copies of the GEs was marked as a hearing exhibit (HE 1) for \nthe record.

On July 1, 2022, Applicant submitted three exhibits, which were accepted in the \nrecord without objection as AEs J through L. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges that, as of November 15, 2021, Applicant owed $19,045 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a) and $2,105 (SOR \u00b6 1.g) on loans for repossessed vehicles; $614 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), $300 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c), and $437 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) in credit-card balances in collections; $25 (SOR \u00b6 1.e) \nin medical collection debt; $55 (SOR \u00b6 1.f) on a charged-off utility account; and $3,956 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.h) in collection debt placed by a former landlord. When Applicant responded to \nthe SOR, he admitted that he incurred the debts but stated that he had repayment \narrangements for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.g, and 1.h; had settled the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b-1.d for less than their full balances; and had satisfied in full the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e \nand 1.f. He provided documents confirming payments, which were accepted into the record \nas exhibits at his hearing. \nI accept Applicant\u2019s admissions to having owed the delinquent balances and \nincorporate them as factual findings. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and \ntranscript, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 32-year-old high school graduate. He and his spouse married in \nFebruary 2014. (GE 1.) They have an infant daughter, who was born in February 2022. (Tr. \n20.) Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor as a Class A machinist since \nMarch 2020. (Tr. 24.) \n2 \n\n \n \n \nApplicant worked as a setup operator for a company in his home state after high \nschool. After some five years there, he was making only $15 an hour, so in April 2013, he \nand his future spouse relocated for a new job paying him $22 an hour in a state with a \nlower cost of living. (GE 1; Tr. 37-38.) The job was in a rural area with limited job prospects \nin the manufacturing sector. (Tr. 37.) A year into his new job, it became apparent that the \nbusiness was failing and layoffs were expected. Applicant indicated on a January 7, 2020 \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) that he left the job before he could be \nlaid off \u201clike many of [his] coworkers were.\u201d (GE 1.) At his hearing, he testified that he was \nlaid off in \u201ca very big downsizing.\u201d (Tr. 36.) Whether he was formally laid off or left \nvoluntarily in September 2014 in anticipation of being laid off, he and his spouse returned \nto their home state. (Tr. 37-38.) Before they left, Applicant informed his landlord (SOR \u00b6 \n1.h) to see if he could be released from the remaining term on his apartment lease. He was \ninformed that he would not have to pay for the months left on his lease provided someone \nmoved into the apartment after they vacated. He did not receive any correspondence from \nthe landlord after he moved. Given the full remaining rent balance was reported on \nApplicant\u2019s credit report, he assumes the landlord did not rent out the vacant apartment. \n(Tr. 51.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFrom October 2014 until January 2020, Applicant worked as a Class A machinist for \na manufacturing company.

(GE 1.) \nOn April 6, 2020, he had a personal subject interview (PSI) with an authorized investigator \nfor the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). While reviewing the financial section on \nhis SF 86, Applicant volunteered that he was delinquent on four accounts: two vehicle \nloans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.g) and two credit-card accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d). He \nexplained that someone in his security office had told him to \u201cleave it blank\u201d if he did not \nhave the information for the accounts. When asked about the debts, he explained that he \nbecame delinquent on the vehicle loan in SOR \u00b6 1.a because of a reduction in income \nwhen he moved back to his home state, and the vehicle was repossessed in mid-2015. He \nadmitted that he had made no attempts to resolve the deficiency balance of about $12,000 \non his loan as he did not have the funds to put toward the debt. As for the auto loan in \nSOR \u00b6 1.g, which Applicant asserted was a joint loan with his spouse but which is reported \nas his loan on his credit report (GE 3), he was $700 behind in his payments for a vehicle \nthat was \u201ca lemon.\u201d He further explained that he tried to resolve the issue before the \nvehicle was repossessed sometime in the summer of 2017. He indicated that he would \ncontact the creditor within the next two months to make repayment arrangements. He \nestimated that he owed respective balances of $300 and $550 on the credit-card accounts \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d, which became delinquent because of a loss of overtime availability. \nHe admitted he had no plans established to address the debts, but he intended to contact \na debt consolidation agency within the next two months. (GE 2.) \nApplicant was then confronted about the delinquent balances on his March 2020 \ncredit report. He stated that he did not realize that the balance of the automobile loan was \nas high as the reported $19,045, and that he plans on including the debt in a debt \nconsolidation plan. Similarly, he did not realize that he owed $608 on the credit-card \naccount opened with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.c. He did not recognize the medical debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.e, or the collection entities identified in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d (same company) and \nSOR \u00b6 1.h, but indicated he would research the accounts and pay the medical debt within \nthe day if it was valid. He recognized the utility provider in SOR \u00b6 1.f but explained that he \ndid not know he owed a balance. He stated that he would research the debt and pay it \nwithin five days if it is valid. He explained that he had been depending on overtime to pay \nhis bills and overtime became unavailable. He denied any chance of recurrence of him \nbecoming delinquent on financial accounts because he was living within his means, making \nmore responsible financial decisions, and not opening any new credit-card accounts. He \nhad not received any financial counseling as of his PSI. (GE 2.) \nAs of July 19, 2021, the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h was no longer on Applicant\u2019s credit \nreport. The other SOR debts were still listed on his credit report. Applicant had a record of \ntimely $420 monthly payments on a joint vehicle loan obtained for $19,794 in July 2018. \nThe balance of the loan was $12,887 as of July 2021. (GE 4.) The loan is for a 2015 \nmodel-year vehicle. It is their only car. (Tr. 53-56.) He had opened a credit-card account in \nMay 2021 with a $1,000 credit limit.

(Tr. \n48.) Apart from paying the medical debt in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.e), he made no effort to \naddress the past-due debts on his credit report before he received the SOR on November \n17, 2021. (Tr. 42, 44, 62.) On receipt of the SOR, he contacted his creditors about \nrepayment arrangements for the car loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.g) and the apartment debt \n(SOR \u00b6 1.h), and for lump-sum settlements on the other delinquencies, as he realized that \nhe had to address them for his clearance eligibility. (Tr. 43-45.) The creditor for the car-loan \ndeficiency in SOR \u00b6 1.a wanted $606 per month, which he indicated he could not afford. \nHe was then given the option of paying what he could each month. (Tr. 68.) He arranged to \nmake monthly payments of $50 on the car debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g and $177 on the apartment \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.h. He did some house and yard work for his parents to pay off a loan for \n$300, sold some of his possessions, and \u201cscraped together\u201d what he could from his income \nto make payments on his debts. (Tr. 46-47.) \nApplicant stopped paying on the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.g after three months. \n(Tr. 20, 42, 50.) He could no longer afford the payments because he and his spouse have \nincurred about $200 in monthly expenses for their daughter\u2019s diapers and formula since \nher birth in February 2022. (Tr. 66.) He continued to make his monthly payments toward \nthe apartment debt. (AE K.) \nApplicant and her spouse combined their incomes when she was working. He \nhandled the monthly household bills, including paying their rent. His spouse paid for the \ngroceries and yearly vehicle taxes. They made an effort to keep each other informed about \ntheir expenses. (Tr. 34-35.) Applicant\u2019s hourly wage increased to $41 in 2022. (Tr. 25.) He \nhad $1,600 in a checking account in June 2022, most of which was earmarked for his and \nhis spouse\u2019s July 2022 rent. He had only $20 in his savings account. (Tr. 57.) His and his \nspouse\u2019s financial situation is \u201cmore stable than it\u2019s ever been,\u201d but they continue to live \nfrom paycheck to paycheck. (Tr. 60-61.) \nApplicant\u2019s spouse obtained a part-time job, 20 to 30 hours per week in the \nevenings, as a store clerk at $14.25 per hour starting in July 2022. (Tr. 30, 63.) Since they \ncannot afford daycare, Applicant plans to watch his daughter in the evenings when his \nspouse is working. (Tr. 63.) Applicant understands that he did not always exercise sound \nfinancial judgment in the past in that he lived beyond his limited means. (Tr. 19.) He is \ncommitted to seeing through his repayment agreement with his former landlord (SOR \u00b6 \n1.h), and with the expected income from his spouse\u2019s employment, getting back on track \nwith the arrangements for the two defaulted car loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.g). (Tr. 22.) \nApplicant has been timely with his income-tax filings. He currently owes less than \n$1,000 in federal income taxes for a tax year(s) prior to 2020, and tax refunds have been \ntaken and applied to the tax liability. (Tr. 59-60.) Information about the extent of the tax \ndebt and the tax year(s) involved was not presented in evidence. When he began his \ncurrent job, he arranged for additional tax withholdings from his income to help pay down \nhis federal tax debt.

He described Applicant as \n\u201ca quiet presence in a large group of men that are a generation older than him.\u201d Applicant \nhas been willing to learn and asks relevant questions. The supervisor believes Applicant \n\u201chas a trustworthy and dependable character.\u201d (AE I.) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . .  \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nGuideline F security concerns are established when an individual does not pay \nfinancial obligations according to terms. Applicant admits that he defaulted on the accounts \nalleged in the SOR. He knew of four of the debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.g) before his \nApril 2020 PSI, and was alerted about the other delinquencies on his credit report during \nhis PSI. He resolved the $25 medical debt (SOR \u00b6 1.e) in October 2021, but approximately \n$31,000 in charged-off and collection debts remained unaddressed as of the issuance of \nthe SOR in mid-November 2021.

The \nfollowing are relevant to the issues in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) cannot reasonably apply. The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.f, and 1.h were \nincurred in 2014, so some time ago, but the credit-card debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d) and car-\nloan debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g were incurred on accounts opened after Applicant and his spouse \nreturned to their home state. Applicant ignored collection letters received as recently as in \n2017 for his largest debt, the car-loan deficiency in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He took no action to resolve \nany of the debts before October 2021, despite being on notice since his April 2020 PSI that \nthe delinquent balances on his credit report were of concern for his clearance eligibility. An \napplicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and are \nconsidered recent. See, e.g., ISCR 17-03146 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2018), citing, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 15-08779 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2017). \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established in that the failure of his then-employer\u2019s business was a \nfactor outside of his control that led either to his layoff or resignation in lieu of expected \nlayoff in September 2014. Due to the lack of job prospects in that rural area, he and his \nspouse returned to their home state. The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.h are directly \nattributable to the loss of his job and their decision to return to their home state. While he \nand his spouse found work back home, their income was barely enough to meet their \nexpenses. Applicant fell behind on the car loan in SOR \u00b6 1.a around September or October \n2014, and he could not catch up. Lack of income was also a factor in the default of the car \nloan in SOR \u00b6 1.g. However, he admitted at his hearing that he handled his credit-card \naccounts irresponsibly in that he made no attempts to pay down the balances, so not all of \nhis debts are attributable to circumstances beyond his control. \nThe Appeal Board has held that \u201c[e]ven if applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially \narose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his control, the judge could still \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsider whether applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with \nthose financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at \n4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). A \ncomponent of financial responsibility is whether Applicant maintained contact with his \ncreditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current or payment \nplans for resolution of debt balances. After moving for his current job in 2020, he was \nfocused on \u201cstarting his life over,\u201d and did not think about the car loan in SOR \u00b6 1.a. It was \n\u201cout of sight out of mind.\u201d (Tr. 41.) Applicant\u2019s starting wage with the defense contractor \nwas $38 an hour, which was a sizeable increase from the $26 an hour in his previous job, \nalthough his housing costs more than doubled to $2,057 per month. Discretionary income \nwas limited, especially after his spouse stopped working due to her pregnancy in August \n2021. Nonetheless, he had an obligation to reach out of this creditors, inform them of his \nfinancial situation, and attempt to arrange for repayment. He failed to do so in a timely \nmanner. His inaction towards his past-due debts before October 2021 is not mitigated \nunder AG \u00b6 20(b). \nWith the sole exception of the medical debt, which he paid to remove the small \ncollection balance from his credit record, Applicant\u2019s efforts at debt resolution post-date his \nreceipt of the SOR. The Appeal Board has long held that an applicant who begins to \naddress his debts only after having been placed on notice that his clearance eligibility is in \njeopardy \u201cmay be disinclined to follow rules and regulations when [his] person interests are \nnot at stake.\u201d See, e.g., ADP Case No. 17-00263 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2018) (citing \nISCR Case No.16-03122 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, 2018)). Applicant would have had a \nstronger case in mitigation had he been proactive and timely in addressing his debts, but \nhis willingness to resolve the issues of financial concern weighs in his favor. He is credited \nunder AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) with satisfying in full the $25 medical debt (SOR \u00b6 1.e) in \nOctober 2021, and the $55 utility balance (SOR \u00b6 1.f) in November 2021, and with settling \nthe credit-card debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d) for less than their full balances in November 2021. \nConcerning the deficiency balances on the two car loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.g) and \nthe debt owed his former landlord (SOR \u00b6 1.h), Applicant contacted his creditors within \ndays of him receiving the SOR. He established a payment plan for the apartment rent, and \nhis consistent track record of repayment at $177 per month since then reflects sufficient \ngood faith to also resolve that debt in his favor. He exhibited a similar willingness to repay \nthe car-loan debts, but after only three months, he stopped paying on the car-loan \ndeficiency balances when his daughter was born in February 2022. He could not afford to \ncontinue repaying them because of the added expenses associated with having a child and \nhis spouse being unemployed since August 2021. The $19,045 car-loan debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a \nis by far his largest debt, and it was still on his credit report as of July 2021. The debt has \nbeen charged off, and there is no evidence of collection efforts since 2017, so it may no \nlonger be a source of undue financial pressure for Applicant. However, the federal \ngovernment is still entitled to consider the facts and circumstances surrounding an \napplicant\u2019s conduct in incurring the debt and failing to satisfy it in a timely manner. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 14-03991 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 1, 2015). \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWith his spouse starting a part-time job in July 2022, Applicant expects to be able to \nresume payments on the two car loans at some point. Promises to pay off a delinquent \ndebt in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying the debt in a timely \nmanner or otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. See ISCR Case No. 07-\n13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept, 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, \n1999)). Without more of a track record of repayment on the car loans, neither AG \u00b6 20(c) \nnor AG \u00b6 20(d) fully applies. Even so, there is significant mitigating evidence in his favor \nwhen considering his limited finances and the impact of his job loss in 2014. \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Those factors are: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nThe analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some \nof the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \nThe Appeal Board has held that the security clearance adjudication is not a \nproceeding aimed at collecting an applicant\u2019s personal debts. Rather, it is a proceeding \naimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness with regard to \nhis fitness or suitability to handle classified information appropriately. See ISCR Case No. \n09-02160 (App. Bd. June 21, 2010). It is not intended as punishment for past \nshortcomings. There is some evidence of financial responsibility in that Applicant appears \nto be living within his means. He is making timely payments on his current car loan. He is \nnot overextended on credit. His finances are likely to improve in the future as his spouse \nbrings income into the household. Applicant\u2019s supervisor attests to Applicant being \ndependable, trustworthy, and willing to learn on the job. He readily admitted at his hearing \nthat he exercised poor financial judgment in the past. \nAppendix C of Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4 grants DOHA \nadministrative judge\u2019s the discretionary authority to grant initial or continued eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance despite the presence of an issue(s) that can be partially but not \ncompletely mitigated with the provision of additional security measures. See, also, \nMemorandum, Director for Defense Intelligence (Intelligence and Security), dated January \n12, 2018, (\u201cAppendix C identifies authorized exceptions that are to be utilized when making \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nadjudicative decisions to grant initial or continued eligibility for access to classified \ninformation or to hold a sensitive position. . . Effective immediately, authority to grant \nclearance eligibility with one of the exceptions enumerated within Appendix C is granted to \nany adjudicative, hearing, or appeal official or entity now authorized to grant clearance \neligibility when they have jurisdiction to render the eligibility determination.\u201d) \nApplicant understands the importance of addressing his past-due debts if he wants \nto maintain clearance eligibility. He has been unable to maintain payments on two of his old \ndebts because of the extra expenses that come with the birth of a child and not because of \nirresponsible spending. The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-\nperson analysis in financial cases stating: \n. . . the concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and every \ndebt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant demonstrate \nthat he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial problems and \ntaken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge can reasonably \nconsider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and his actions in \nevaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his \noutstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) \n(Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.) There is \nno requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts \nsimultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may \nprovide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no \nrequirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable \ndebt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.  \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and quotation \nmarks omitted). Security officials can check his credit reports and revoke his security \nclearance if he shows a lack of financial responsibility in the future. Applicant testified \ncredibly to his willingness to continue to address his remaining debts. When he received \nthe SOR, he immediately took steps to resolve the debts that he could pay. He did odd \njobs for his parents and sold some of his possessions for the funds to make settlement \npayments. His progress in resolving his delinquent debts provides assurance that he will \nresume payments on his remaining two delinquencies. After carefully considering the \nwhole-person concept and weighing the financial considerations security concerns, I find \nthat it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue \nApplicant\u2019s clearance eligibility. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant \ndecided to have her case decided administratively on the written record in lieu of a \nhearing. On March 1, 2022, the Government sent a copy of its File of Relevant Material \n(FORM), the Government\u2019s evidence in support of the allegations in the SOR, to \nApplicant. On page 2 of the FORM, the Government advised Applicant that although \nsome states and other jurisdictions had decriminalized marijuana use, drug use remains \nillegal under federal law and is antithetical to holding a security clearance. (See, \nSecurity Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies \nConducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, ES 2021-01529). Applicant \nreceived the FORM on March 7, 2022. The FORM recommended she file objections, \nsubmit additional information or provide explanations within 30 days of receiving the \nFORM. Applicant\u2019s response was due on April 6, 2022. DOHA received no response. I \nwas assigned the case on May 13, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR contains one allegation that Applicant used marijuana from January \n2012 to November 2021. (Answer to SOR) In her February 14, 2022 answer, she \nadmitted the allegation, but contended that since 2016, she only uses the drug clinically \nfor anxiety or depression, not recreationally. She noted that the drug has been \ndecriminalized in the jurisdiction where she lives.

(Item 3 at 1-8) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines, which should be applied \nwith common sense and the general factors of the whole-person concept. All available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, \nshould be carefully reviewed before rendering a decision. The protection of the national \nsecurity is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning \npersonnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the \nnational security.\u201d Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \napplicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d \nThe applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security \ndecision. \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern under the Drug Involvement/Substance Abuse Guideline \nis set forth in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \n3 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession \nof drug paraphernalia; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue use. \nApplicant furnished several explanations of her marijuana use since 2012. In \nher March 2021 e-QIP, she disclosed that her first use of the drug was in 2012. Her \nreason for use was anxiety and depression. Although she was not formally diagnosed \nby a doctor, she discussed her use with her mental health practitioner. Her discussions \nwith her doctor do not excuse her violation of federal law. She indicated that, \u201cI have not \nused marijuana consistently since 2011 (she probably meant to state 2012 because she \nidentified her first use in the e-QIP as 2012). She noted, \u201cHowever[,] since the beginning \nof 2020, I have used it on an as needed basis.\u201d (Item 2 at 34) After discussing \nalternative methods of easing anxiety with her mental health practitioner, her future \nintention was to use medication, writing, and gaming, rather than marijuana. Applicant \nnever received drug treatment. \nLess than two months later in her April 26, 2021 PSI with the OPM investigator, \nApplicant apparently changed her mind and decided to continue using marijuana to \nrelieve her anxiety rather than meditation, writing, and gaming. She stated she was \nusing marijuana three times a week, but she could not recall when she first started \nusing the drug. In her November 23, 2021 interrogatory answers, she claimed her first \nuse was in January 2019 and her last use was in November 2021. She described her \nmarijuana use as occurring three to four times a week. Her future intentions were to use \nmarijuana to reduce stress, but she would discontinue use if required. \nIn her February 14, 2022 answer to the SOR, Applicant contended that since \n2016, she has only used the drug clinically for anxiety or depression, not recreationally. \nShe noted that the drug has been decriminalized in the jurisdiction where she lives. She \nindicated that her future use would be as needed. In summary, Applicant\u2019s use and \npossession of marijuana falls within the purview of AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c). Her \nstatements of intention to use marijuana in the future satisfy AG \u00b6 25(g). \n4 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any \nfuture involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national \nsecurity eligibility. \nApplicant has provided inconsistent explanations of her marijuana use \nsince 2012. These conflicting accounts undermine her overall credibility and raise a \nreasonable inference that she is using marijuana more than she describes. She \nintends to use the drug in the future to medicate her anxiety and depression. She \ndid not reply to the FORM. There is no evidence she stopped using marijuana or \nthat she has made the necessary lifestyle changes to maximize the chances of \nabstinence from marijuana in the future.

The \nsafeguarding of classified information, together with complying with security regulations \nand the federal law, is an around-the-clock responsibility that does not end when an \napplicant leaves work at the end of a work day, or when she is at home or on vacation. \nApplicant was placed on notice that her marijuana use was becoming a security \nconcern to the Government by the time she furnished her interrogatory answers in \nNovember 2021. Rather than stating that she would forego future marijuana use, she \nprovided a conditional response which indicated she would continue to use unless \nrequired to stop. That intention describing future use, coupled with her regular use of \nthe drug in recent years, disqualifies Applicant from security clearance eligibility. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(Item 2) She is 48 years old, \nmarried, with two adult children from a previous marriage. Applicant has two \nundergraduate degrees, which were obtained in 1996 and 2016. Applicant has been a \npsychiatric technician for a federal contractor since approximately September 2014. \n(Item 3) Applicant has not served in the military. She has not held a security clearance. \nApplicant completed her security clearance application (SCA) on May 21, 2021. \nFinancial Considerations \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has 23 delinquent debts, which include credit \ncard debt, medical accounts, a car note she obtained for her daughter, education debts, \nand utility accounts. The total amount of delinquent debt, not including the car note is \n$20,000. The car note is $13,000. (Item 2) The allegations are supported by her \nadmissions and A credit report.

She stated that she had no knowledge of the \nother SOR allegations, but then she agreed after confrontation that she was behind in \nthe accounts due to low funds. As to the medical bills, she stated that she was not \naware of them, but planned to call to set up payment plans. Applicant characterized her \nfinancial situation as \u201cneeding more work\u201d. She is willing to repay all debts. She was \nconsidering debt consolidation. Applicant was given an opportunity to submit more \ninformation to the investigator, but did not do so. (Item 5) Applicant used two \ndebt \nservices in 2019 and 2021, but she terminated them without resolving any debts.

However, she \ndid not provide any receipts to show payments made to the account. In fact, she \ndisputed this account to the credit bureau. \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.g, an account in the amount of $819, Applicant settled the debt for \n$283, evidenced by a receipt. \nApplicant claimed that she made arrangements to settle the $13,763 car loan \nalleged in the SOR \u00b6 1.v for $3,443.69, with a monthly payment of $143.66. However, \nthe payments do not begin until January 26, 2023. \nWhen Applicant responded to the FORM, she presented three credit bureau \nreports which showed that she had disputed most of the accounts alleged in the SOR \nand some of which had been deleted. However, she is credited with having settled or \npaid all of the SOR debt. (Response to FORM) She did not present any new information \nto show progress, only her intent to make payments pursuant to the agreed settlements. \nThere is no information in the record concerning Applicant\u2019s income, expenses, \nor monthly net remainder. There is no record of financial counseling. She did not \npresent a budget or a plan for most of the delinquent debts. She obtained debt services \nin 2019 and 2021, but stopped using them. \nApplicant has addressed a few of the smaller accounts, but that is a fraction of \nwhat she currently owes. Approximately $570 has been repaid. Most of the other \npayments occurred after the receipt of the SOR. She promised during her interview to \nbegin paying last September, but she did not do so. She failed to provide evidence that \nshe is making payments on the debts that she settled. \nApplicant did not meet her burden of proof in this case. \nShe failed to \ndemonstrate that her financial issues have been or are being resolved. There is not a \nsufficient track record of payments. It is difficult based on the record to establish that \nApplicant is making a good-faith effort to repay or resolve overdue creditors or that her \nfinancial situation is currently under control. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by her credit reports, establish disqualifying \nconditions under the guidelines: AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts), and 19(c) a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.) \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant admitted that she is responsible for the delinquent debts listed in the \nSOR, with the exception of the few that she has paid. She intends to pay her debts, but \na promise to pay in the future is not sufficient. With respect to the remaining delinquent \ndebts she listed one or two settlement agreements, but she has not made any \npayments. Her statement is vague about volunteering and not working in 2013. \nApplicant presented no information on her income. She has not received financial \ncounseling. This is not sufficient evidence to shed positive light on her financial state. \nThere is no meaningful track record of repayments. She did have some circumstances \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbeyond her control, some loss of income, and her husband\u2019s lack of employment at \nsome time, but she did not act responsibly. Based on the record she does not have the \nrequisite judgement, reliability, or trustworthiness needed to have access to classified \ninformation. She has not met her burden and none of the mitigating conditions apply. \nAny doubts must be resolved in favor of the Government. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. Applicant suffered a loss of some income while \nvolunteering but provided no nexus to the accumulation of her debts which largely \nremain unresolved. She has been working consistently, but there is insufficient \nevidence in the record for me to conclude that she will be able to meet her future \nfinancial obligations. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.1.c-1.f:: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j, 1.l, 1.o, 1,q, 1.v: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g, 1.i, 1.k, 1.m, 1.n, 1.p,1u: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

This item has \nalready been listed as a charge off by the debtor. Therefore, entering into \na payment arrangement does not serve to reverse the impact to my credit \nreport nor serve to positively increase my credit standing. \nApplicant has not made any payments toward the SOR debts since 2019. He \nretained a law firm to assist him with his credit. He was advised that the creditors have \nwritten off the debts, and they will age off his credit reports, but if he attempts to \nnegotiate with the creditors, it could restart the clock. Since seven years is the standard \nwindow for reporting adverse matter, most of his debts will not \u201cage off\u201d the credit report \nuntil about 2026. Several debts were disputed and deleted from the credit report for \nreasons other than that Applicant did not owe them. (Tr. at 20-22, 42-44, 52-55; GE 4-7; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR) \nExcept for the unpaid SOR debts, Applicant\u2019s finances have improved. His \nannual salary is $150,000. He stated that since his credit cannot be repaired by money, \nhe is not vulnerable to coercion, and that in his opinion, the debts should have no \nbearing on his security clearance. (Tr. at 28, 36, 66) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems and delinquent debts. The evidence \nindicates that it was difficult for him to pay his debts; however, he could pay the smaller \ndebts and start to pay the larger debts at some point, but he chose not to. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \n19(b), and 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit\ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were related to his contentious divorce, the \nactions of his ex-wife, and unemployment. To receive the benefit of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must \nhave acted responsibly under the circumstances. He has not paid any of the SOR \ndebts, not even the $174 and $145 debts. He is following the advice of a law firm to wait \nuntil the debts age off his credit report. Several debts were disputed and deleted from \nthe credit report for reasons other than that Applicant did not owe them, but most of his \ndebts will not age off the credit report until about 2026. The fact that a debt no longer \nappears on a credit report does not establish any meaningful, independent evidence as \nto the disposition of the debt. See, e.g., ADP Case No. 14-02206 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 15, \n2015) and ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015). \nApplicant argued that he is not subject to coercion or compromise, but that is not \nthe only security concern generated by financial problems. The concern is broader than \nthe possibility that a person might knowingly compromise classified information to raise \nmoney. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nqualities essential to protecting classified information. A person who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May \n1, 2012). \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his \ndebts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that financial \nconsiderations security concerns remain despite the presence of some mitigation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

On December 17, 2021, the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) \nissued Applicant an SOR detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). The CAF issued the SOR under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 4, 2022 (referenced as 2021 in error), \nand requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to the \nDOHA hearing office on February 3, 2022, and assigned to me on September 6, 2022. \nOn September 19, 2022, DOHA issued a notice scheduling the hearing for October 24, \n2022, by video-teleconference through an online platform. \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered \ndocuments that I marked as Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1, 2A, 2B, 3, and 4. Applicant \ntestified and offered Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through D. (She had included AE D with \nher Answer). All of the exhibits were admitted without objection.

(GE 3) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($38,680) is a debt that has been charged off by a credit union. (GE 2b; \nAE C) Applicant explained that the debt is a joint account between her and her former \nhusband, regarding two vehicles that they purchased together while they were married. \nThey fell behind on the car payments in about 2016, during their period of separation, and \nthe cars were voluntarily repossessed. The alleged amount is what remains after resale. \n(Tr. 34-40, 66-68; GE 2a at 3; GE 2b) \nApplicant testified that she contacted the creditor to propose a settlement several \nyears ago, without success, since she could not afford what they offered. This was when \nshe had to move following the marital separation. Her funds went towards moving and \nfinding a home for herself and her children, and she could not address her debts until her \nsituation stabilized. Her then husband was also unhelpful. Since the vehicles were \nfinanced jointly, she could not settle her auto account alone. (Tr. 48-49, 67-68, 75-76) \nApplicant provided a January 2022 letter, addressed solely to Applicant\u2019s former \nhusband, referencing a repayment agreement under which he is to pay $380 per month \nfor 101 months, with the final payment in April 2030. (AE A) She testified that he is making \npayments to resolve the debt. She has no documentation from him because they are not \non speaking terms. She said that she has asked the creditor to inform her of any issues \nwith his payments. In that event, she would assume the payments, though she has no \ndocumentation from the creditor to document such an arrangement. She said her former \nhusband told her that he was advised during his own security clearance application \nprocess that he has to take care of the debt and is doing so. (Tr. 37-42, 46-50) She \nagreed, though, that \u201chalf of it is mine.\u201d (Tr. 69-71) She believes he is a government \ncontractor but does not know where he works.

The last payment, of $300, was made on September 30, 2022. (AE B; Tr. 26) \nApplicant\u2019s husband has sometimes paid less than what is owed on the account. (Tr. 49) \nThe debt is being resolved by Applicant\u2019s former husband, pursuant to a documented \nagreement with the creditor. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b ($1,209) is an account placed for collection by a utility company. The \ndebt is about 8 or 10 years old, and is an account related to Applicant\u2019s marital home, \nwhich she left in 2016. She believes she brought the account current before she left.

(GE 3; AE D; Tr. 27-28, \n31, 50-55, 65, 74-75) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($507) is a retail credit-card account placed for collection by a bank. \n(GE 2b) Applicant indicated in her Answer that she had arranged to settle the account. \n(Answer) She said in her testimony that she settled the account for about $200 about five \nmonths before the hearing. She was unable to provide documentation of the payment, \nbut said she would repay the debt if needed. She said a recent flood in her home \ndestroyed any paperwork she might have had. (Tr. 32-34, 55-58, 84-85) \nApplicant explained that her divorce precipitated her financial issues because her \nformer husband stopped making payments on their accounts, without caring about the \nimpact on her finances. She has taken care of her own finances since the divorce, and \nhas had no financial issues since then. She has had her job for 15 years, and this is the \nfirst financial issue she has had. She knows her finances impact her job and needs the \njob to provide for her children. She will do what it takes to resolve her debts. (Tr. 44; GE \n4 at 6) \nApplicant provided a personal financial statement (PFS) with her interrogatory \nresponse in March 2021. It shows net monthly income of about $3,330 and monthly \nexpenses of about $2,620, leaving a net surplus of about $710. (GE 4 at 7) She testified \nthat her monthly income has since increased, to about $3,522, though her savings in the \nbank have decreased by a few hundred dollars. She sends money to her daughter who \nis in college. (Tr. 59-61) She has not participated in credit counseling. (Tr. 64) Her tax \nfilings are up to date. (Tr. 64) \nApplicant\u2019s former husband is supposed to pay her $619 a month in child support. \nHe has not done so in six months, but she was just notified that his wages will soon to be \ngarnished to address it. (Tr. 43, 72-73, 86-87) \nApplicant submitted an additional statement after her hearing. She said she wished \nshe \u201ccould have done things differently\u201d during her separation and divorce. Her aim was \nbeing there for her children as a parent and keeping her life from falling apart. She enjoys \nher job, which has been a big part of keeping things together as a family.

(AE J \u2013 AE M) In her annual \nwork appraisals from 2018-2021, she is chiefly rated from Good to Excellent to \nOutstanding in her various evaluation criteria. (AE F-AE I) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out, \nin relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nTwo of Applicant\u2019s three delinquent debts occurred around the time that she and \nher husband separated and divorced. Her debts are established by her admissions and \nby credit report data in the record. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; \nApplicant and her then husband experienced financial problems during the \nbreakdown of their marriage. They found that they were not able to afford the two vehicles \nthey purchased jointly, so those cars were voluntarily repossessed. The debt for both \nvehicles remains listed on Applicant\u2019s credit report. However, she also provided a letter \nfrom the creditor, addressed to her former husband alone, under which he has \nresponsibility to pay under their settlement agreement. (AE A) Recent credit report \nexcerpts show that payments are largely being made. The debt is being resolved by \nApplicant\u2019s former husband, pursuant to a documented agreement with the creditor. She \nstates that she will assume responsibility for the payments if her former husband does \nnot do so, but for now, they are his responsibility. SOR \u00b6 1.a is being resolved and AG \u00b6 \n20(e) applies. \nThe other two debts at issue are quite minor. One is an old power bill, also dating \nback to Applicant\u2019s former marriage. That debt has now been removed from her credit \nreport. SOR \u00b6 1.b is resolved, and AG \u00b6 20(e) also applies to it. This leaves only the credit \ncard account at SOR \u00b6 1.c, for $507. Applicant said she settled if for about $200 earlier \nthis year, and if she has not, she will do so, something she can clearly afford. SOR \u00b6 1.c \nis also resolved. \nApplicant understandably had financial difficulty adjusting to life without her \nhusband\u2019s second income (and he has yet to provide required child support). But no other \ndebts are evident. Her personal financial statement demonstrates financial stability. She\nnow lives with her mother and sister, so there is no indication that she lives extravagantly \nor above her means. Her priority is, and has been, to provide for her children. She has a \nlong career as a federal contractor, and does not want to do anything to jeopardize that. \nI also had the opportunity to observe Applicant\u2019s demeanor during the hearing, and I found \nher testimony credible. I find that her debts were largely attributable to her marital \nsituation, and are not likely to be repeated, at least by Applicant\u2019s own conduct. She has \nacted reasonably under the circumstances, and her financial issues are unlikely to recur\nand no longer cast doubt on her judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \nand 20(b) both apply.\n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Applicant provided sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concern \nshown by her delinquent debts. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions \nor doubts as to her continued eligibility for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

He retired from the Navy in 2019 as a lieutenant commander (O- 4). Applicant is employed by a defense contractor as a program manager and is attempting to retain a security clearance in relation to his employment. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, 15, and 17; Applicant Exhibits J, K, L, and N.) Paragraph 1 (Guideline I: Psychological Conditions) The DoD CAF alleged in this paragraph of the SOR that Applicant is not eligible for access because he has an emotional, mental or personality condition that can impair his judgment, reliability or trustworthiness. Paragraph 2 (Guideline D: Sexual Behavior) The Government alleged in this paragraph of the SOR that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged in sexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment or discretion; or may subject Applicant to undue influence, coercion, exploitation, or duress. The following discussion will be primarily chronological. During a period of psychological treatment discussed below Applicant was engaging in several extra-marital affairs and other addictive sexual activities.

DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the \nhearing on June 3, 2022. \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 8, which were admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant Exhibits \nA through Q, which were also admitted without objection. He asked that the record remain \nopen for the receipt of additional documentation. Applicant timely submitted Applicant \nExhibits R, S, and T, which were admitted without objection. Applicant submitted \nApplicant Exhibit U outside of time, and it was admitted over Department Counsel\u2019s \nobjection. The record closed on June 6, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 45 years old and married with two children. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree \nand a master\u2019s degree. He retired from the Navy in 2019 as a lieutenant commander (O-\n4). Applicant is employed by a defense contractor as a program manager and is \nattempting to retain a security clearance in relation to his employment. (Government \nExhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, 15, and 17; Applicant Exhibits J, K, L, and N.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline I: Psychological Conditions) \nThe DoD CAF alleged in this paragraph of the SOR that Applicant is not eligible \nfor access because he has an emotional, mental or personality condition that can impair \nhis judgment, reliability or trustworthiness. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline D: Sexual Behavior) \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph of the SOR that Applicant is ineligible \nfor clearance because he has engaged in sexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; \nreflects a lack of judgment or discretion; or may subject Applicant to undue influence, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. \nThe following discussion will be primarily chronological. During a period of \npsychological treatment discussed below Applicant was engaging in several extra-marital \naffairs and other addictive sexual activities. \nThe Government stated at the hearing that they were not proceeding on SOR \nallegations 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d. Those allegations solely concerned mental health \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling obtained by Applicant. Paragraph 27 of the AG, which sets forth the concern \nunder this guideline, states in pertinent part, \u201cNo negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental health counseling.\u201d \nBased on the Government\u2019s representation, SOR allegations 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d are found \nfor Applicant. Allegation 2.b is hereby amended to conform with the above findings. It now \nreads, \u201cThat information set forth in subparagraph 1.c, above.\u201d (Tr. 8.) \nApplicant had a series of sexual relationships with women who were not his wife \nstarting in 2016 and ending in 2018. Three of these were \u201cone-night stands.\u201d A fourth was \na long-term emotional and sexual relationship that lasted several months. All of these \nincidents occurred while Applicant was on active duty with the Navy. He has stated that \nhe has not engaged in extra-marital sexual activity since 2018. \nApplicant has also stated that he has a long-term addiction to pornography, which \nhe is unable, or unwilling, to stop. As described further below, he has been receiving \ntherapy for these issues since 2017. He also participates in a 12-step program for sex \naddiction. \nGovernment Exhibit 2 consists of Applicant\u2019s response to DOHA interrogatories. \nSpecifically, the exhibit includes the Reports of Investigation (ROI) of Applicant\u2019s \ninterviews with authorized investigators from the Office of Personnel Management. Those \ninterviews will be discussed as appropriate. \nApplicant\u2019s first affair began in approximately October 2016 and continued into \n2017. He became emotionally as well as sexually involved with this person. They \ncorresponded on social media, and met several times for sex. He described this \nrelationship in an ROI dated April 5, 2019. (Government Exhibit 2 at 10; Tr. 36-37, 57-\n58.) \nApplicant began voluntary psychiatric and psychological treatment while he was \non active duty in the Navy on March 21, 2017. In his initial intake interview he stated a \ndesire to receive treatment for anxiety and depression symptoms. He also stated that he \nhad issues with pornography. He was diagnosed with \u201cAdjustment Disorder with \ndepressed mood.\u201d There is no indication that he discussed his extra-marital sexual \nrelationship with his therapist at this time. (Government Exhibit 7 at 1-11.) \nApplicant\u2019s second affair involved a single incident with a woman he met on work-\nrelated travel in 2017. He stated in his testimony that there was an additional one-night \nincident with a different woman, also in 2017. This incident was not otherwise revealed \nuntil the hearing. (Government Exhibit 2 at 11; Tr. 37-38.) \nApplicant joined a 12-step program (Sex Addicts Anonymous) in December 2017. \nHis sponsor from this program provided a letter in support of Applicant.

He further testified that he contacted his 12-step group \nsponsor the day after this happened. (Government Exhibit 2 at 11; Tr. 37-38, 45-46.) \nApplicant testified that he realized his extra-marital sexual activity amounted to \ncommission of the offense of Adultery under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). \nHe did not tell his command or security officer about his conduct. (Tr. 46.) \nThe next note in the Navy medical file is from March 22, 2018. The note includes \na diagnosis that Applicant continues to suffer from \u201cAdjustment Disorder with depressed \nmood.\u201d Pertinent excerpts from the Progress Notes are as follows, \u201cPatient [Applicant] \nreported that he had a period of almost one month with no social media. During that time \nhowever, patient appears to have reverted back to many his old habits (i.e. drinking more \nthan agreed-upon; talking to old flings). Patient eventually re-downloaded many of the \nsocial media apps.\u201d There is no indication that he discussed his extra-marital sexual \nrelationships with his therapist at this time. (Government Exhibit 7 at 13-18.) \nApplicant filled out an e-QIP on April 5, 2018. (Government Exhibit 1.) Section 21 \nof the questionnaire asked Applicant about mental health treatment. Under \u201cOptional \nComment\u201d he stated, \u201cI have sought out and continue to receive medical mental health \ntreatment and counseling for Anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms relating to \ntraumatic experiences growing up in a region with high rates of violent crime, as well as \ndeployment to Iraq in 2013-2014.\u201d \nThe next note in the Navy medical file is from May 29, 2018. The diagnosis \ncontinues to be \u201cAdjustment Disorder with depressed mood.\u201d It appears that Applicant \nhas told his providers of his extra-marital affairs by this time. Pertinent excerpt from the \nProgress Notes are as follows: \nPatient reported that he failed with his goal of nonsexual behavior outside \nof his work responsibilities (while on travel). Patient reported that he called \nhis sponsor after the behavior. Patient stated that he has started to \nrecognize how \u201caddicted\u201d he is to sexual pursuits. Patient reported that his \nsponsor taught him about the 3 circles of addiction. Patient talked about the \ncorrelation between his drinking behavior and his acting out sexually. \nPatient talked about the benefits of continuing to go to SA [Sex Addicts \nAnonymous] meetings. (Government Exhibit 7 at 19-24; Tr. 39.) \nApplicant was interviewed on June 5, 2018. The ROI stated, \u201cThere is nothing in \nthe Subject\u2019s background that can be used against him for blackmail or coercion.\u201d There \nis no mention in the ROI that Applicant discussed his history of sexual activity outside of \nmarriage or his problems with pornography with the investigator.

This meeting \nappears to have been precipitated by his two primary providers (Dr. F and Dr. R). \nPertinent excerpts from the Note are as follows: \nPatient informed that he was being rescreened for his security clearance \n(TS/SCI) and that different investigators had approached both of us about \nhis treatment. It was discussed with the patient that we both had \nreservations about not making the proper authorities aware of his apparent \naddiction to sexually related behavior/environments. Patient was informed \nthat both providers would be making comments on his reevaluation of his \nsecurity clearance in regards to his treatment of his sexually related \nbehavior. \nPatient has been compliant with all treatment recommendations to date. \nPatient has been significantly involved in the SA community and has a \nsponsor that he checks in with regularly. Patient routinely meets with his \npastor, attends therapy and is managed with medication by Psychiatry for \nhis sexual addiction. (Government Exhibit 7 at 25.) \nApplicant was asked by me whether he told his command or security officer that \nhis therapists were going to notify Federal investigators of his sex addiction. He stated, \u201cI \ndid not. And, truth be told, when I was at that particular Command, I was only operating \nat a Secret Clearance. I did not even know who the FSO [Facility Security Officer] was. I \nthink my intent was just to be honest with the background investigation.\u201d (Tr. 56-57.) \nThe next note in the Navy medical file is from September 21, 2018. The diagnosis \nchanged at this point to be \u201cOther Sexual Disorders, Sex Addiction.\u201d Pertinent excerpts \nfrom the Progress Notes are as follows, \u201cPatient and therapist talked about his impulsive \nsexual behavior. Patient talked about the concept of seeing his addiction as \u2018an enemy\u2019 \nand how he needed to approach like \u2018a battle.\u2019 Patient talked about the importance of not \nmaking excuses for his behavior or why he has not made more progress with his 12-step \nSA program.\u201d (Government Exhibit 7 at 27-32.) \nThe next note in the Navy medical file is from December 13, 2018. Applicant had \na change in providers at this time. The diagnosis changed at this point to \u201cGeneralized \nAnxiety Disorder and Dysthymic Disorder.\u201d Pertinent excerpts from the Intake Notes are \nas follows: \nOveruse of pornography & sexual behavior incompatible with personal \nethics. Patient believes that his struggles with pornography are related, as \nalcohol is, to his proclivity to \u201cdistract myself\u201d from personal discomfort. \nBelieves he was exposed early in life to pornography, that it was normalized \nby other men, and believes that it has been destructive for him in that it often \ninsidiously takes up greater amounts of time than he plans. Further, it has \ninvited his actual acting out (consensual extramarital sex) with women he \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmeets either while traveling or through Tinder/online \u201chook-up\u201d sites. Has \nwanted to stop watching porn and couldn\u2019t control his use of it over time (up \nto several hours per day in more remote hx [history]). Seems to evaluate \nwomen physically (my wife is really beautiful, but this other woman was \nbeautiful too) and sees porn as primarily a problem for men (i.e. lack of \nempathy for the women involved). \nHe struggles with monogamy (even w/in the past year has had a 6 month \naffair and can\u2019t stop \u201cchecking out what\u2019s on Tinder\u201d) as well and feels guilty \nabout his behavior. Says wife is not OK with him having extramarital \nsex/relationships, that she knows about \u201csome\u201d of this activity, and that she \nis willing to stay with him \u201cas long as she believes I\u2019m working on it.\u201d \nPersonal inadequacy and career disappointments: Pt got passed over twice \nfor CDR, says \u201cI got derailed,\u201d and he\u2019ll be retiring after this tour at 20 years.\n. . . He feels left out and left behind, as his friends are \u201cSEALS and \nastronauts.\u201d He feels profoundly inadequate, like a failure personally and \nprofessionally. He admits he has little insight about how this, along with \nearly attachment issues, may contribute to his psychiatric symptoms and \ndysfunctional behavior. (Government Exhibit 7 at 33-42; Tr. 39-40.) \n \nApplicant and his wife deny that he had a six-month affair in the 2017/2018-time \nframe with yet another woman. (Applicant Exhibit R; Tr. 38-40.) \nAs stated, Applicant was interviewed by a DoD investigator on April 5, 2019. The \ninvestigator reported in pertinent part: \nSubject was told that the initial complaint for medical and psychiatric \ntreatment was overuse of porn and sexual behavior incompatible with \npersonal ethics. The provider does not trust Subject\u2019s behavior due to his \nimpulsive sexual behavior and feels the condition may impair Subject\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Subject is treated/counseled for this behavior. \nSubject feels the provider may feel that way because Subject had an affair \nand considers himself a sex addict. Subject provided Dr. [R] may be \nconcerned about Subject being blackmailed because of the behavior which \nhe struggled with outside of his marriage with meeting other women which \nstarted two years ago. Subject is not proud of it and got the help himself \nwhen he started this behavior two years ago. (Government Exhibit 2 at 10.) \nThe ROI continued: \nSubject does agree with his judgment and reliability is not optimal and that \nhe engaged in extramarital sexual activity when he travels which was \ndiscussed earlier in the interview. Subject feels that he agrees with the \nprovider stating that his impulsive sexual behavior and feels his condition \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nmay impact Subject\u2019s judgment and reliability on his personal matters but \nhas no effect on his professional life. (Government Exhibit 2 at 12.) \nThe last note in the Navy medical file is from April 17, 2019. The diagnosis \nchanged to \u201cOther Sexual Disorders, Sex Addiction and Narcissistic Traits.\u201d \nPertinent excerpts from the Progress Notes are as follows: \nSA Meetings: multiple times per week (tele-meeting by phone or in-person.) \n. . . Patient stated that he is due to get his one-month chip soon. Patient \ntalked about his frustration with his background investigation. Patient talked \nabout boundaries at work since finding out that 2 women have now blocked \nhim on social media. Patient talked about his relationship with his wife. \n(Government Exhibit 7 at 43-48.) \nApplicant stated that he received counseling from his mental health medical \nproviders concerning his conduct with co-workers discussed immediately above. He was \nnot counseled by his command. (Tr. 42-45.) \nApplicant testified that he believed that he has or did have Generalized Anxiety \nDisorder and Depression as described by his Navy providers above. He further stated \nthat he believed the conditions are controlled by psychiatric treatment and medication. \n(Tr. 25.) \nAs noted, Applicant retired from the Navy in 2019. He then began receiving \ntreatment from a Dr. J at the VA starting in November 2019. The Progress Notes from the \nVA are Government Exhibit 8. They begin on June 5, 2020. \nThe Progress Note of September 11, 2020, stated in part, \u201cHe [Applicant] reported \nrelapse on his sexual compulsion maybe 4 times in two weeks.\u201d (Government Exhibit 8 \nat 7.) \nApplicant testified that the above probably referred to his looking at pornography. \nHe also conceded that it might have been his conduct in \u201cchecking\u201d women out on social \nmedia. (Tr. 41-42.) \nThe same Progress Note also stated under \u201cAssessment/Plan,\u201d \u201cAfter 3 months of \nno compulsive sexual behavior he relapsed acouple [sic] of weeks ago.\u201d (Government \nExhibit 8 at 10.) \nApplicant testified that the above incident involved pornography. The date of the \nNote is stated incorrectly as, \u201cJune 5, 2021,\u201d in the question asked by Department \nCounsel. (Tr. 40-41.) \nApplicant and his wife began couple\u2019s therapy with Dr. M in January 2021. The \ntherapy was for \u201cProcess Addiction/Sex Addiction.\u201d He began individual therapy in August \n2021. Dr. M provided a letter dated February 8, 2022. (Applicant Exhibit P.) The provider \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwrote that both Applicant and his wife were cooperative in the process. The letter goes \non to state, \u201cBoth [Applicant and his wife] have made progress and there has been better \ncommunication and less conflict in the relationship. [Applicant] has also made progress \nwith his individual treatment and been able to decrease and eventually eliminate the \nbehaviors for which he was seeking help.\u201d \nApplicant was interviewed by a DoD psychiatric consultant (Dr. S) on May 10, \n2021. His report is Government Exhibit 5. Applicant\u2019s history as related by him to Dr. S \nbasically tracks with other documents in the record and is not repeated here. Dr. S also \nspoke to three coworkers of Applicant and one of his current mental health providers. \nMr. H was interviewed by Dr. S. He is a supervisor of Applicant for Applicant\u2019s \nemployer. He stated that Applicant is a \u201cdiligent worker who is a highly engaged team \nplayer.\u201d He further stated that he does not believe Applicant has any mental health or \nsubstance abuse issues. Finally, he stated, \u201cSource [Mr. H] believes that the Subject\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness are intact and highly recommends him.\u201d \n(Government Exhibit 5 at 5.) \nA second supervisor of Applicant, Mr. M, was also interviewed. He is the program \nmanager for a military program that works with Applicant\u2019s employer. Mr. M had a different \nview of Applicant, stating that he would often react emotionally when receiving feedback \nor direction. He also discussed a particular issue he had concerning Applicant\u2019s \ninteractions with Ms. V, further discussed below. Mr. M felt that Applicant displayed poor \njudgment in his interactions with Ms. V and Mr. M about the issue. Mr. M concluded by \nsaying:\n \n \n \n \n \nSource [Mr. M] stated that he has concerns about Subject\u2019s judgment based \nupon the incidents discussed. Source denied any concern about the \nSubject\u2019s reliability. Source believes that the Subject is mostly honest but \nwill omit details or information. Source was initially ambivalent about \nrecommending the Subject but eventually confirmed that he would \nrecommend him if there were an abundant amount of oversights and \ncontrols in place to scaffold the Subject. Source stated that the Subject \ncurrently works with several constraints and boundaries within his role \nwhich were placed there out of necessity. (Government Exhibit 5 at 5-6.) \nMs. V is the security officer for a military program that works with Applicant\u2019s \nemployer. She is not his company\u2019s security officer. She discussed a particular incident \nwith Applicant that she felt was not handled properly by Applicant. The incident is not \nrelated to the mental health or sexual misconduct issues discussed in this decision, but \nshe and Mr. M believe it showed poor judgment on Applicant\u2019s part on that particular \noccasion. Speaking in general about Applicant Ms. V stated: \nSource credited the Subject with making improvements with coaching and \nappropriate changes when corrected. However, Source also expressed \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconcerns about the Subject\u2019s emotional stability and believes that there is \nan ever-present possibility that he may react aggressively to situations that \nare not favorable to him. Source confirmed that there were interpersonal \nissues between him and other workers but would not go into further detail. \nSource deferred on speaking to the Subject\u2019s ability to have good judgment \nas she has significant reservations. Source denied any concerns about \nSubject\u2019s reliability. Subject deferred speaking about the Subject\u2019s honesty \nand trustworthiness due to omissions. Source stated that she would \nrecommend him with similar caveats as Mr. [M]. (Government Exhibit 5 at \n6.) \nApplicant denied that he had ever acted in the way described by Mr. M and Ms. V \nin their interviews with Dr. S. He believes that their incorrect statements are due to \npersonality conflicts between the three of them. (Tr. 49-52.) \nDr. S also talked to Dr. C, who is Applicant\u2019s psychologist. She has been treating \nApplicant since January 2021. She stated: \nSubject has weekly sessions and has engaged in EMDR [Eye Movement \nDesensitization and Reprocessing Therapy] and is currently working on a \nbook on sex addiction. Source reported that the Subject presented with a \nvariety of psychological and behavioral issues that were rooted in his \nupbringing. Subject seeks validation and is susceptible to anything that he \nperceives as rejection. Subject may respond to perceived rejection with \nanger, anxiety, or mood lability. Subject may act out or become \nconfrontational with those involved in such instances as well. Source \nconfirmed that the Subject may also seek validation from other pursuits or \npeople. Source denied that [sic] any knowledge of affairs beyond those \nalready discussed by the Subject. Subject has shown improvement through \nthe EMDR and is more insightful towards his triggers but is vulnerable to \npersonalizing and emotional reasoning. Source believes that the Subject \nhas good judgment in regard to national security work and stated that his \nissues with judgment are mainly in regard to his personal life. Source \nbelieves that the Subject is reliable and is a trustworthy and moral individual. \n(Government Exhibit 5 at 6-7; Tr. 54-55.) \nDr. S gave the following Diagnostic Impression, Diagnosis, and Prognosis on page\n7 of Government Exhibit 5. The Diagnostic Impression is as follows:\n \n \nThe Subject was referred for evaluation to determine if his previous\ndiagnoses or behaviors impair his judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness.\nThe Subject has been previously diagnosed with depressive disorders and\nself-reported anxiety in the context of performance or perception of others.\nWhile the Evaluator concurs that the Subject has suffered from both kinds\nof symptoms in the past, the symptoms are better explained through the\nlens of a personality disorder.

The majority of the maladaptive issues \npreviously discussed were the direct result of him experiencing rejection, \nneeding validation, being affectively triggered by external events, or \nquestioning his identity/purpose in life. The behavioral expression of these \nissues were the affairs, increased use of pornography, and increased use \nof alcohol. The diagnoses below attempt to best capture his expression of \npsychological issues over the reported timeline. \nThe Diagnoses are, \u201cOther specified personality disorder, mixed cluster B traits; \nHistory of social exclusion or rejection; and History of parent/child relational problem.\u201d \nDr. S provided the following Prognosis: \nThe presence of a personality disorder with these traits will inherently place \nthe Subject at a varying amount of risk in terms of judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. That level of risk will depend heavily upon the Subject\u2019s \nperception of stability and self-worth across personal and professional \nareas and his ability to manage his emotional reactivity. When balanced, \nthe Subject with likely perform well. When unbalanced, the Subject will likely \nexpress the aggressive/labile traits mentioned by his references. The \nevents previously discussed and the collateral information gathered over \nthe course of this evaluation show explicit examples of how his emotional \nreactivity and perception of rejection can result in impulsive behaviors and \nunfavorable decisions. Credit should be given to the Subject who responded \nto his previous affairs by initiating counseling, being dedicated to treatment, \nand searching for ways to avoid future unfaithfulness. This illustrates that \nthe Subject is willing to adapt and seek answers to his problem with the \ncorrect motivation, boundaries, and consequences. However, it should be \nunderscored that such adjustments occurred after he acted in ways, that he \nadmits, were against his values, impulsive, and had the possibility of \ncausing irreparable damage to his family. It should also be noted that the \nSubject had already been engaged in both counseling and medication \ntreatment when the affairs occurred. While his last indiscretion occurred in \n2018, he still struggles with emotional reactivity as evidenced by the \ntestimony provided by his therapist and references. The feedback from \nthose who have regular contact with him in a professional environment \nshould be taken very seriously as positive impression management is \nalways a factor during cross-sectional evaluations. \nA Progress Note dated January 11, 2022, from the VA stated that Applicant had \nattended a program aimed at reducing his compulsive sexual behaviors.

In \npart the letter says, \u201cHe [Applicant] is taking his medications and comes to his follow-up \nappointments regularly. He has been seeking help and has agreed with different \ntreatment modalities and he has been noticing an improvement in his symptoms.\u201d \nDr. J submitted an additional letter dated June 3, 2022.

He is very motivated to seek help and \nhas agreed with different treatment options including medication, different psychotherapy \nmodalities, and rehab programs. Based on his report and my evaluation it sounds like \nthat [sic] he is improving.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit U.) \nApplicant testified that he is following Dr. J\u2019s advice \u201cto the letter.\u201d Applicant also \ntestified that he believed he had obtained adequate skills to curtail the adverse sexual \nactivity that was alleged, particularly that caused by professional or personal \ndisappointments. He stated that there have been several contributors to his ability to \ncontrol his behaviors, \u201cThe skills and treatment I have received in counseling, my support \ngroup and support of my wife, and accountability and accountability partners.\u201d (Tr. 25-27, \n48-49.) \nWith regard to adverse sexual activity, Applicant testified that there were several \nfactors that would prevent him from engaging in such conduct again, \u201cNumber one, the \nfact that I do not want to do that. Number two, that immediately when I started manifesting \nthat behavior, I recognized that this was not something I wanted to do, and I sought help \nfor it. Number three, my support group. Number four, the support of my family.\u201d (Tr. 32.) \nApplicant testified that his last relapse of sexual compulsion was several months \nbefore the hearing, sometime in 2021 or early 2022. He stated that those behaviors \ninclude \u201clooking at pornography, contacting women with the intent to flirt or otherwise \nmake liaisons.\u201d He further stated that his wife is aware of this activity. (Tr. 47-48.) \nApplicant\u2019s wife submitted two declarations on his behalf. In Applicant Exhibit A \nshe stated that she is aware of the allegations contained in the SOR and that the two of \nthem are attending counseling. She believes Applicant has shown \u201csignificant \nimprovements and no longer participates in the concerned conduct.\u201d (Tr. 46-47.) \nAfter the hearing Applicant\u2019s wife prepared Applicant Exhibit R.

(Applicant Exhibits D, F, G, and I.) \nApplicant received positive recommendations from a fellow Sailor who served with \nApplicant. He stated, \u201cHaving known [Applicant] for over 20 years now, I have consistently \nknown him to be a loyal friend, competent professional, and dedicated patriot of \nimpeccable integrity with an overwhelming devotion to serving the country he loves.\u201d \n(Applicant Exhibit E at 1; Tr. 29.) \nA former supervisor of Applicant during his time in the Navy also submitted a letter \nstating, \u201cI absolutely know he exceeds every standard for trustworthiness and character \nboth interpersonally and with regard to national security. In the five years I\u2019ve known \n[Applicant], he can be relied on to perform all duties with integrity and honesty.\u201d (Applicant \nExhibit E at 3; Tr. 31.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nApplicant has been suffering from a compulsive psychological condition for many \nyears. This condition manifests itself primarily in sexual and sexually-related activity that \ncan consist of excessive pornography use, inappropriate inter-personal activity at work, \nuse of the computer and social media to contact and \u201cflirt\u201d with various women, and serial \nacts of adultery. \nApplicant has been \u201caddicted\u201d (his word) to pornography for many years. Starting \nin 2016 and continuing until at least 2018 the behaviors increased after he was passed \nover for promotion. As set forth at length above, Applicant had four sexual relationships \noutside of marriage, one a long-term affair lasting from four to six months. There is some \nindication that there may be one or two more, but Applicant and his wife deny it. He also \nwould use various dating \u201capps\u201d to meet and flirt with women online. It appears he also \nengaged in inappropriate inter-personal conduct at work, resulting in two female \ncoworkers blocking him on social media. Applicant testified that he has not had an affair \nsince 2018, but he continues to suffer from obsessive sexually-related thoughts and \noccasional obsessive conduct. According to Applicant, the last time this happened was \nlate 2021 or early 2022. \nApplicant began treatment in 2017 while still on active duty with the Navy. The \nextensive excerpts from the Progress Notes are included to show both what Applicant \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntold his providers about his conduct, and also what was missing from his reports. It \nappears that Applicant knew he needed help, but did not inform his providers that he was \nhaving sex outside of marriage for several months. As the providers correctly noted, they \nneeded to make the Government aware of his \u201capparent addiction to sexually related \nbehavior/environments\u201d during his periodic reinvestigation. At that point, he had the \nopportunity, indeed the responsibility, of informing his command and his FSO that his \nmental-health providers believed that his conduct could make him a security risk. His \nexcuse is that he only had access to Secret material, and did not know the person who \nwas the FSO. \nApplicant has attempted to create a false dichotomy between his private conduct \nand professional conduct that does not exist. In fact, he has said that his impulsive sexual \nbehavior may impact his judgment and responsibility on a personal level, but has no \nimpact on his professional life. That is wrong. For example, Applicant was involved in \nextra-marital sex repeatedly while on active duty with the Navy. He was highly vulnerable \nat that time to coercion and exploitation, yet he seemed not to understand that fact at all. \nThis inability to understand or appreciate why his conduct can make him a security risk \npervades the entire record. \nApplicant has received extensive treatment over the years. Currently he goes to \nmultiple therapy sessions each week, is on a medication regimen, and is part of a 12-step \nprogram. There is some indication that Applicant\u2019s condition is getting under control, but \nhis conduct has been too extensive for too long. \nAn additional concern for me is that Applicant has not always been an accurate \nreporter of his conduct. It is obvious that for a considerable period of time he misstated \nor understated the extent of his conduct to his providers. His credibility, as well as his \njudgment, are suspect. \nParagraph 1 (Guideline I: Psychological Conditions) \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Psychological Conditions is set \nout in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 28 contains five conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions are established: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors; and \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability or \ntrustworthiness. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 29 contains five conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nWith regard to Guideline I, Applicant has voluntarily entered into treatment for a \ncondition that may be amenable to treatment. Dr. J, the VA psychiatrist, says, \u201cBased on \nhis report and my evaluation it sounds like that he is improving.\u201d That statement does not \nqualify as a favorable prognosis. AG \u00b6 29(a) and (b) are minimally applicable under the \ncircumstances of this case. \nAG \u00b6 29(c) does not apply because there is no mental health finding that the \nprevious condition is under control or in remission and has a low possibility of recurrence \nor exacerbation. Indeed, the best that can be said is that treatment is helping Applicant \nmaintain minimal control over his impulses through great effort. \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n     \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant testified that he continued to deal with the condition within a few months \nof the hearing. Accordingly, it cannot be said that there is no indication of a current \nproblem or signs of emotional instability. AG \u00b6 29 (d) and (e) do not apply. Guideline I is \nfound against Applicant. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline D \u2013 Sexual Behavior) \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Sexual Behavior is set out in AG \n\u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion, or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 13. Four are applicable in this case: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(b) pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior that \nthe individual is unable to stop; \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \nThe following mitigating conditions are possibly applicable under AG \u00b6 14: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and \n16 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \nApplicant\u2019s obsessive sexual conduct involved acts of a criminal nature, \nspecifically adultery while on active duty, which is an offense under the UCMJ. His \ncounsel argued that adultery is seldom prosecuted, minimizing the impact of this \ndisqualifying condition. That argument has been considered and is rejected. AG \u00b6 13 (a) \napplies. \nAll of Applicant\u2019s sexual conduct as set forth in the record, including the acts of \nadultery, were and are compulsive, high-risk, and self-destructive. By their very nature \nthey reflected a lack of discretion and judgment that caused him to be vulnerable to \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. AG \u00b6 13 (b), (c), and (d) do apply. \nApplicant\u2019s wife appears to be fully aware of the extent of his activities. He has \nstated that his management also knows about them. AG \u00b6 14(c) has minimal application. \nApplicant\u2019s sexual liaisons were mutual, private, and discrete. However, his other \nsexually obsessive conduct is of an in-person or virtual nature. Accordingly, it cannot be \nsaid to be private or discreet. AG \u00b6 14(d) also has minimal application. \nBased on the current state of the record, I cannot say with any degree of \nconfidence that Applicant\u2019s conduct is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. AG 14(b) does not apply. \nFinally, for the reasons set forth under Guideline I, I cannot presently find that his \nconduct is readily controllable with treatment and that he has a favorable prognosis, AG \n\u00b6 14(e) does not apply. Guideline D is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \n17 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not mitigated the \nconcerns regarding his psychological conditions and related sexual conduct. He has not \nminimized the potential for pressure, coercion, or duress, and I cannot find that there is \nlittle likelihood of recurrence. Overall, the record evidence does create substantial doubt \nas to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline D: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \n18 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

The case was assigned to me on September \n13, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 41 years old. He married in 2006 and divorced in 2015. He has two \nchildren with his ex-wife. He also has two children with a former girlfriend. He currently \ncohabits with his new girlfriend. His children\u2019s ages are 16, 10, 8, and 7.

(Item 3) \nApplicant served on active duty in the military from 2000 to 2014 and received an \nhonorable discharge. He chose to leave the service and accept a year of severance pay \nwhen the military was reducing its ranks during a drawdown. After his discharge, he was \nunemployed for about eight months. He decided to use his military educational benefits \nand go back to school for a period. He then held several jobs for short periods of time. He \nhas worked for his current employer, a federal contractor, since October 2020. (Item 3) \nThe SOR alleges 11 delinquent debts totaling approximately $49,234, which are \ncharged-off or in collection status. They are corroborated by Applicant\u2019s admissions in his \nanswer to the SOR, disclosure in his security clearance application (SCA), statements \nmade to the government investigator, and credit reports from July 2021 and December \n2020. Many of the debts became delinquent in 2018. (Items 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,) \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to being underemployed. He states that \nbecause he changed careers, he has had to start at the bottom of the pay scale, and he \ndoes not earn enough to pay his bills and his child support. He also stated that he moved \nin 2015 to an area with a higher cost of living. He is living paycheck to paycheck. His \ncurrent annual salary is approximately $70,000, but he was previously earning only about \n$49,000. He stated in his SCA that he got behind in paying some of his bills because of \nhis child support payments, but intended to get back on track. (Items 3, 4) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s January 2021 background interview with a government \ninvestigator, he stated that he cannot pay all of his creditors at the same time. He said he \nwas working on paying some of his small debts. He did not provide evidence of payments \nhe may have made to these creditors. He said that although he would like to pay the \nlarger debts, he is unable to do so with the amount of his salary and his child support \nobligations. He plans to settle his delinquent accounts eventually. He provided no other \nevidence or documents to corroborate resolution of his delinquent debts.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has 11 delinquent debts totaling approximately $49,234 that began \naccumulating in about 2018, and which he is unable to pay. There is sufficient evidence \nto support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant has been unable to pay his delinquent debts. He attributes his financial \nproblems to being underemployed and having to pay his child support. He has not paid \nany of the accounts. He said he plans to eventually pay the debts, but did not provide a \ntimeline on when that might occur. His underemployment is beyond his control. Paying \nchild support is not. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. He has not paid any of his delinquent debts and did \nnot offer evidence of how he intends to do so in the future. AG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal \napplication. \nApplicant has not made a good-faith effort to resolve his debts. There is no \nevidence that he has participated in financial counseling and there are not clear \nindications his financial problems are under control. His debts are recent and there is \ninsufficient evidence to conclude that future problems are unlikely to recur. His behavior \ncasts doubt on his current reliability, good judgment and trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 20(a) \nthrough AG \u00b6 20(d) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances.

In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be \nused in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201c[a]ny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise security concerns. Two may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant admitted that he has old delinquent debts and student loans, which he \nhas been unable to resolve. The evidence raises the above security concerns, thereby \nshifting the burden to Applicant to rebut, extenuate, or mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could potentially mitigate \nsecurity concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s admitted financial problems: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nThere is insufficient evidence to establish mitigation under any of the above \nmitigating conditions. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts have been outstanding and unresolved \nsince he took out his student loans between 2008 and 2009, and his car loans in 2015 \nand 2017. They continue to cast doubt on his reliability. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant attributed his delinquent debts to a period of time during his father\u2019s \nillness when he helped his father and brother with their financial problems in 2015. Those \nwere circumstances beyond his control, although he chose how to allocate his available \nfunds at the time. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. He did not provide sufficient evidence to \ndemonstrate that he attempted to responsibly manage his debts as they were \naccumulating. AG \u00b6 20(b) applies partially. \nApplicant did not provide evidence that he participated in credit or financial \ncounseling. He has not established a budget to show responsible financial management \nof his delinquent student loans and other financial commitments. The evidence is \ninsufficient to conclude that there are clear indications that Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts \nare under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. He did not submit documentation that he \nmade a good-faith effort to establish a plan to resolve his debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not \napply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n               \n \n \n \n    \n \n              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant served in the Marine Corps for \nfive years and received an Honorable discharge. He has worked for his current employer, \na defense contractor, since 2015. Between 2008 and 2009, he took out student loans \ntotaling $23,700 that are not being resolved. Between 2015 and 2017, he obtained two \ncar loans that are delinquent and total over $26,750. He submitted no evidence of \nbehavioral changes and the potential for pressure, coercion, or duress remains \nundiminished. Based on the evidence, and the lack of an established track record of \nresponsible financial management, Applicant failed to meet his burden to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised under the guideline for financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a through 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for access to classified information.

The \nDCSA CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the National Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective for any \nadjudication made on or after June 8, 2017.

Applicant did not respond. On May 5, 2022, the case was assigned to \nme. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 56-year-old married man with two adult children. After graduating from \ncollege in 1990, he joined the U.S. Air Force (USAF) where he served for 20 years until \nretiring honorably in 2011. (Item 2 at 12) While in the USAF, he flew aircraft. After retiring, \nhe worked as a pilot for two commercial aircraft companies. Since August 2019, he has \nbeen working for a defense contractor as an aircraft lab test director. (Item 2 at 12) \nApplicant has a drinking problem. Between 1983 and 2018, he consumed \napproximately 10 to 14 alcohol drinks daily. (Item 1 at 3) Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption \nresulted in a 1985 arrest for driving under the influence. He later pled guilty to the lesser \ncharge of driving while ability impaired. (Item 1 at 3) Applicant\u2019s alcohol abuse also led to \nfamily problems, as it caused his wife to temporarily separate from him in 2013. (Item 4 at \n14) \nApplicant frequently flew airplanes while intoxicated, both in his military and civilian \ncareer. He would sometimes drink up to a bottle of alcohol the night before flying. (Item 3 \nat 7) He was fired from both of his commercial piloting jobs for showing up to work \nintoxicated. (Item 4 at 14, 16) On the second instance, a Transportation Security \nAdministration (TSA) agent smelled alcohol on his breath as he was passing through the \nairplane checkpoint. The TSA agent then contacted the TSA supervisor, who called the \npolice. Upon arriving, the police administered a field sobriety test. (Item 5 at 2) The test \nrevealed that Applicant\u2019s blood alcohol content was three times the state limit for driving an \nautomobile. (Item 5) The police then escorted Applicant from the airplane. Consequently, \nthe airline had to cancel the flight, deplane the passengers, and reschedule them for later \nflights. (Item 5 at 2) \nThis episode prompted the acting administrator of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration to issue an emergency order revoking Applicant\u2019s airman certificates. (Item \n6 at 1) Subsequently, Applicant was fired. (Item 5 at 1) \nIn November 2018, after Applicant\u2019s termination, he checked into an inpatient \nalcohol treatment facility. (Item 3 at 7) He attended inpatient treatment for 30 days, \nfollowed by outpatient treatment once a week for eight weeks. (Item 4 at 7) In January \n2019, he was diagnosed with severe alcohol dependence. (Item 1 at 4; Item 4 at 20) As \npart of his treatment, he received individual and group therapy. (Item 4 at 5, 9) He \nsatisfactorily completed the inpatient treatment program. (Item 4 at 20) \nApplicant has been clean and sober since checking into the alcohol treatment facility \nin November 2018. He attends Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings regularly, as well as \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \ntherapy sessions. (Item 4 at 5, 7, 10) He characterizes himself as \u201ca better, more reliable, \nand more trustworthy person\u201d since he stopped drinking alcohol. (Item 1 at 2) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nUnder this concern, \u201cexcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of \nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d (AG \u00b6 21) Applicant abused alcohol for more \nthan 30 years. He habitually reported to work intoxicated, leading to the loss of two jobs. \nHis alcohol use led to one alcohol-related arrest and had an adverse effect on his \nmarriage, as it led to a separation in 2013. Most troubling, his alcohol use repeatedly \njeopardized the safety of others, as he flew military and commercial aircraft while \nintoxicated countless times over the years. In 2018, he was diagnosed with severe alcohol \ndependence. Under these circumstances, the following disqualifying conditions apply under \nAG \u00b6 22: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such a s driving while under the \ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in an \nintoxicated or impaired conditions, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing the \nwelfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social worker) \nof alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant voluntarily entered an alcohol treatment program, successfully completed \nit, and has not consumed any alcohol in more than three years. Under these \ncircumstances, the mitigating conditions set forth under AG \u00b6 23(b), \u201cthe individual \nacknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol use, provides evidence of actions \ntaken to overcome this problem, and has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of \nmodified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations;\u201d and \nAG \u00b6 23(d), \u201cthe individual has successfully completed a treatment program along with any \nrequired aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations,\u201d apply. \nApplicant has been sober since November 2018. There is no record evidence, \nhowever, of any clinical update gauging his current well-being, whether his alcohol \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \ndependence diagnosis is in remission, or whether his drinking is likely to recur. Given the \nnature and seriousness of Applicant\u2019s problem, the length of time that he has been \nabstinent from alcohol, alone, is insufficient to carry the burden. Under these \ncircumstances, none of the remaining mitigating conditions apply, and Applicant has failed \nto mitigate the alcohol consumption security concerns. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) Applicant\u2019s history of flying aircraft while intoxicated triggers the \napplication of AG \u00b6 16(d)(1), \u201cuntrustworthy or unreliability behavior . . .\u201d Under 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 \n120.37(b), no employee who performs safety-sensitive functions shall show up to work with \na blood alcohol content of .04 percent or greater. Applicant\u2019s violation of this federal \nregulation during the episode that led to his termination in 2018 and for the multiple times \nbefore this episode trigger the application of AG \u00b6 16(d)(3), \u201ca pattern of . . . rule \nviolations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s voluntary enrollment in an alcohol abuse treatment program and his \nsuccessful completion of it, together with his three-and-a-half years of abstinence \nconstitute positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress, under AG \u00b6 17(e). Given the severity of the alcohol dependence, the length of time \nthat he abused alcohol, and the extraordinary circumstances under which some of the \nalcohol abuse occurred, the positive taken to address the problem are insufficient to \nmitigate the Personal Conduct security concerns. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness [and] by its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d (AG \u00b6 30) It is a federal \ncrime to fly an airplane while intoxicated. (18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 342) Consequently, Applicant \nbroke the law each time he operated a plane while intoxicated during both his military and \nhis civilian career. This criminal conduct, together with his 1985 alcohol-related arrest \ntriggers the application of AG \u00b6 31(b), \u201cevidence . . . of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.\u201d \nAfter Applicant was caught attempting to fly an aircraft in 2018 while intoxicated, the \nFAA revoked his airman\u2019s certificate. Consequently, the possibility of him flying another \naircraft, whether intoxicated or not, is highly unlikely. As for the alcohol-related offense, it \noccurred more than 35 years ago. Although Applicant certainly has unresolved security \nconcerns related to his history of alcohol consumption, there are no ongoing criminal \nconduct security concerns. I conclude the mitigating condition set forth in AG \u00b6 32(a), \u201cso \nmuch time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such \nunusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d applies. Applicant has mitigated \nthe criminal conduct security concern. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the whole-person factors in my analysis of the disqualifying and \nmitigation conditions, and they do not warrant a favorable conclusion. I conclude Applicant \nhas failed to mitigate the security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s SOR response, she denied all of the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.s. The credit reports in the record support the SOR allegations. Additional findings follow. Applicant is 40 years old, and she has been employed by a government contractor as a budget analyst since October 2019. Her annual salary is about $112,000. In 2014, she received a bachelor\u2019s degree in business management. She married in 2008, and she has two children, ages 11 and 17. She was separated from her spouse from about 2017 until 2020, when they reconciled. She currently possesses a DOD secret security clearance. (GE 1; Tr. 26-32) Financial Considerations The SOR alleges 19 delinquent debts; the majority of which are delinquent student loans. At the hearing, Department Counsel divided the SOR debt into three categories: consumer debt (totaling $3,968), student loans referred for collection with the U.S. Department of Education (ED) (totaling approximately $127,682), and delinquent student loans held by private debt servicers (totaling $18,432). Applicant testified that she denied all of the debts in her SOR response, because she did not agree with the \u201cbalance\u201d or the \u201cdelinquent\u201d status of the account. She admitted, however, that she was responsible for all 19 accounts.

I held the record open until September \n2, 2022, in the event either party wanted to supplement the record. On August 26, 2022, \nDOHA received a transcript (Tr.) of the hearing. On August 31, 2022, Applicant submitted \none document, which I labeled as AE O, which was admitted into evidence without \nobjection. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, she denied all of the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nthrough 1.s. The credit reports in the record support the SOR allegations. Additional \nfindings follow. \nApplicant is 40 years old, and she has been employed by a government contractor \nas a budget analyst since October 2019. Her annual salary is about $112,000. In 2014, \nshe received a bachelor\u2019s degree in business management. She married in 2008, and \nshe has two children, ages 11 and 17. She was separated from her spouse from about \n2017 until 2020, when they reconciled. She currently possesses a DOD secret security \nclearance. (GE 1; Tr. 26-32) \nFinancial Considerations \nThe SOR alleges 19 delinquent debts; the majority of which are delinquent student \nloans. At the hearing, Department Counsel divided the SOR debt into three categories: \nconsumer debt (totaling $3,968), student loans referred for collection with the U.S. \nDepartment of Education (ED) (totaling approximately $127,682), and delinquent student \nloans held by private debt servicers (totaling $18,432). Applicant testified that she denied \nall of the debts in her SOR response, because she did not agree with the \u201cbalance\u201d or the \n\u201cdelinquent\u201d status of the account. She admitted, however, that she was responsible for \nall 19 accounts. (SOR response; Tr. 35-36) \nConsumer Debt: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.q allege that Applicant owes a total of $2,786 for delinquent \nconsumer credit accounts placed for collection by the same creditor.

He had been laid off, and he was not providing any money to assist with \nthe household expenses. She also received a significant pay cut after leaving her position \nwhere she earned about $55,000 per year, to accept a civilian position with the DOD. She \nwas placed into a trainee program, and her annual salary was approximately $46,000. In \nSeptember 2017, she left her government job to work for a government contractor, and \nher salary increased from about $46,000 to $65,000. Applicant and her spouse eventually \nreconciled and they moved back into the family home in 2020. Her husband also returned \nto work for his employer where he earns about $55,000 annually. (Tr. 61-66) \nApplicant filed for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2006. During that period of time, she \nwas a young mother and had purchased a family car financed by a loan with a high \ninterest rate. She worked part-time at a bank, and soon found herself obtaining money \nfrom a payday lender to keep her car payments current. It did not take long to concede \nshe was in serious financial trouble. Applicant and her spouse filed for Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy protection, because they wanted to pay off their debts and keep the family \ncar. The bankruptcy trustee administered the five-year repayment plan, but they \nsuccessfully finished their payments in four years. The bankruptcy court discharged the \ncase in 2010.

In an \nattachment statement, she explained that she was already working to resolve her \ndelinquencies prior to the date she became aware that the government was concerned \nabout her financial issues. She rehabilitated her student loans held by private debt \nservicers and placed the loans into forbearance. Her student loans with the U.S. \nDepartment of Education were deferred due to the COVID-19 pandemic. She then \nfocused her attention on paying off all of her delinquent consumer accounts with her \ndisposable income. She is scheduled to begin her student loan payments after December \n31, 2022. She provided documentation of her efforts to consolidate all of her student \nloans, except her Perkins loans, under the Direct Loan Program.

(AE A, AE I, AE J, AE K, \nAE O; SOR Response) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd.

Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.   \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \nmitigating conditions. \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).

She had a previous \nChapter 13 bankruptcy and discharge in 2010, but in 2017, her finances became \ndelinquent again. Circumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control adversely affected her \nfinances, including an unforeseen separation and loss of income from her spouse from \n2017 through 2020. Additionally, she experienced a period of underemployment, to \ninclude a reduction of about $10,000 of her annual salary when she accepted a new job. \nHowever, \u201c[e]ven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due \nto circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether \nApplicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with those financial \ndifficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May \n25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). A component is whether \nhe or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments \nto keep debts current. \nThere is sufficient evidence that the consumer debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.q and 1.s, totaling about $3,968, have been paid. I find that Applicant mitigated these \nSOR allegations. \nApplicant\u2019s income has increased over recent years and is now six-figures. Her \nmost recent budget showed that she had a net monthly remainder of $3,000 after paying \nexpenses, to include her estimated monthly student loan payment beginning in January \n2023. Although there is insufficient evidence to establish a track record of steady student \nloan payments, I find Applicant to be credible in her on-going efforts to resolve her student \nloans; some that were delinquent before the COVID relief was enacted, and some that \nwere rehabilitated after she made nine consecutive monthly payments. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. \nIn December 2021, Applicant provided documentation with her SOR response of \nher good-faith actions to resolve her delinquent debts. I find that Applicant acted in a \nreasonable and responsible manner when dealing with her financial delinquencies by \npaying off her consumer debt, rehabilitating her student loans with private servicers, and \nsubmitting paperwork to consolidate almost all of her student loans. She has established \na workable monthly budget and has not created any new delinquent debt. It is clear that \nshe is committed to repaying all of her outstanding student loan accounts. I find that \nfinancial considerations security concerns are mitigated. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant\u2019s actions have removed any lingering doubts about her commitment to \nresolving all of her delinquent accounts. She has demonstrated the requisite good \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness that is required for continuing a security \nclearance. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person. Applicant successfully mitigated financial considerations \nsecurity concerns.   \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.s: \nFor Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

After a review of the pleadings \nand evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began working \nat his present job in 2020. He is an aircraft mechanic inspector. He is a high school \ngraduate and received technical training. He married in 2003 and divorced in 2005. He \nmarried his current wife in 2012. He has three children from his first marriage and three \nstepchildren from his current marriage. He has a child support obligation for his \nyoungest child that ends in November 2022, upon her 18th  birthday. (Tr. 6, 20; GE 1)  \nThe SOR alleged 18 delinquent debts, including a child support obligation, two \nfederal income tax debts for years 2014 and 2016, five medical debts, and ten \nconsumer debts totaling approximately $35,537. The debts are established by \nApplicant\u2019s admission in his March 2021 security clearance application (SCA), his \nadmissions in his Answer and at hearing, and his credit reports. (Tr. 20-22; GE 1-3; \nAnswer) \nApplicant testified that his financial troubles began when his wife was laid off \nfrom her job. She was earning approximately $30,000 annually and assisting with the \nfamily finances. The Covid pandemic impacted her ability to get a job, leaving Applicant \nthe sole wage earner for the family. His wife then decided to go back to school to earn a \nnursing degree. While completing her degree, she started working part time, in early \n2021, for an employer who is assisting with her school tuition payments. She began full-\ntime employment in August 2021. (Tr. 20-22, 26, 29-30) \nApplicant contacted his creditors in an attempt to work out payment plans, but \nthat effort was met with no success because the payments they demanded were too \nhigh for his income. In 2021, he contracted with a debt relief company (DRC) to have \nthem negotiate settlements on his delinquent accounts. From January to October 2021, \nhe documented making 14 payments of approximately $225 each to the DRC. Applicant \nwas unsatisfied with the lack of progress by the DRC so he terminated his contract with \nit. In about October 2021, he contacted a bankruptcy attorney and was advised to \npursue a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which he did. (Tr. 21-22, 28, 33-35; AE D) \nApplicant filed his initial Chapter 13 petition in October 2021. He participated in \nfinancial counseling as part of the bankruptcy. All his SOR-listed creditors were notified \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nabout the bankruptcy in order to file claims. An initial payment plan was developed in \nFebruary 2022. He documented that beginning in April 2022, he was making \napproximately $1,500 per month payments to the bankruptcy trustee. The payments \nwere directly from his work paychecks. An amended plan was prepared and accepted in \nSeptember 2022. Under the accepted plan, Applicant\u2019s monthly plan payments will be \napproximately $3,300 monthly. This higher amount is because the final plan includes \npayments for his mortgage and two cars. Previously, he was making these payments on \nhis own, outside of the plan. Applicant calculates that his total monthly income will be \nused to make the bankruptcy plan payments. Their remaining monthly expenses will \ncome out of his wife\u2019s income, which is approximately $2,500 monthly. Additionally, his \nchild support payments of approximately $386, which are currently coming out of his \nmonthly paychecks, end in November 2022. These payments included his monthly \nobligations and arrearages. (Tr. 17, 36, 37-38; AE A-C, F-J) \nApplicant explained that he did not have the funds to pay his 2014 and 2016 \nfederal income taxes at the time they were due. He documented that he paid his 2014 \nfederal taxes in 2015 and now has a zero balance. His 2016 federal taxes were paid in \n2017 and there is a zero balance. (Tr. 38; GE 1; AE E) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.

I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant incurred debts that he was unable to resolve because of his wife\u2019s \nunemployment and the impact of the pandemic, which were conditions beyond his \ncontrol. He acted responsibly by first trying to work with his creditors to resolve his \ndebts, then by hiring a DRC and paying them $225 in 14 payments. The DRC did not \nproduce results, so Applicant turned to using Chapter 13 bankruptcy as a way to pay his \ncreditors. He received financial counseling. He has made $1,500 monthly payments to \nthe bankruptcy trustee since April 2022 and before the final plan was approved. The \nbankruptcy judge signed an order for Applicant to pay the trustee $3,300 monthly on \nSeptember 26, 2022. He documented that he has been paying his child support \npayments, which will end in November 2022. He also documented that he satisfied his \ndelinquent federal taxes owed long before the SOR was issued. Applicant\u2019s actions in \ndealing with his financial problems establish his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. Moreover, through his payments to the trustee, he has established a track \nrecord of financial responsibility. All the above mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nfederal contractor service, his wife\u2019s unemployment, the circumstances surrounding his \nindebtedness, and his efforts to resolve his debts. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a - 1.r: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The case was assigned to \nme on April 27, 2022.  \nFindings of Fact \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I \nmake the following findings of fact: \nApplicant is 38 years old, married, and has a 12-year-old daughter. He is a high \nschool graduate and has about a year and a half of college credits. Applicant served on \nactive duty in the U.S. Army from August 2005 until June 2010. At the time of his February \n2018 SCA, he was employed by a defense contractor. (Item 2.) Applicant is currently \nsponsored by another defense contractor. \nThe SOR alleged five delinquent credit card accounts with the same creditor \ntotaling over $118,000. Applicant admitted these allegations with explanations. (Answer \ncover letter.) His February 2018 SCA disclosed no delinquent accounts. (Item 2.) That is \nverified by a March 2018 credit report (all accounts were Pays As Agreed). (Item 3.) By \nthe July 30, 2021 credit report, the five SOR debts were delinquent. (Item 4.) \nApplicant began working overseas for a defense contractor in June 2011. His \ncontract ended in December 2018. By that time, Applicant\u2019s yearly salary was $220,000. \nHe was unemployed from December 2018 until May 2019, when Applicant was employed \nby another defense contractor. That position, however, paid $130,000 per year. From \nMay 2019 until December 2019, Applicant stayed current on his household expenses by \nusing his savings and credit cards. Since he paid only the minimums due each month on \nhis credit cards, the balances increased. (Answer cover letter.) \nBy December 2019, Applicant realized that while he was able to stay financially \nafloat, he was not able to reduce his debts. As a result, at that time, Applicant retained a \nlaw firm to handle debt consolidation and settlements with his creditors. He was put on a \n48-month debt consolidation plan. Under that plan, Applicant and the firm opened a joint \naccount that the firm could use to resolve his debts. To further that goal, Applicant \nautomatically deposits $1,599 per month into that account. (Answer cover letter.) \nAs of Applicant\u2019s March 8, 2022 Response, he has settled two of the five SOR \naccounts. For those two settlements he paid $300 per month and $695 per month. \nApplicant has provided the following documentation: \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n** December 6, 2019 Agreement and Payment Schedule with Applicant and the \nfirm. \n** Two January 22, 2021 settlement agreements with two SOR accounts. \n** December 15, 2021 letter from the firm stating that Applicant has been a client \nof the firm since December 2019 and has consistently made the monthly deposits \nto the joint account. \n** Applicant\u2019s monthly settlement payments/month ($300 and $695) to the joint \naccount from December 13, 2019, to January, 20, 2022, for the two settlements \n** Applicant\u2019s monthly payments ($1,599) to the joint account from December 13, \n2019, to January 20, 2020. \n** March 3, 2022 Credit Report showing the January 6, 2022 resolution of the two \nSOR accounts. \nWhen Applicant filed his Response on March 8, 2022, he still had 22 months left \non his agreement with the firm. Applicant continues to make the $1,599 monthly payments \nto the joint account. The firm continues to negotiate with the creditor for the three \nremaining SOR accounts. In light of the two already concluded settlements, Applicant is \nconfident that the remaining three accounts will also be resolved. (Answer and Response \nand related documents.) \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to Guideline F for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nGuideline F notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following condition is applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR debts are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and the Government\u2019s \ncredit report. AG \u00b6 19(a) applies. \nGuideline F also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment . . .), and the individual acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances); and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems did not occur that long ago. They arose when he \nbecame unemployed from December 2018 until May 2019. In 2018, Applicant\u2019s financial \nrecord was spotless. That changed in May 2019, when his new job paid 40% less than \nhis former job. To make ends meet, Applicant used savings and credit cards. That took \nits toll, and by July 2021, he had five delinquent debts that found their way into the SOR. \nRealizing that his financial situation would only get worse, Applicant retained a law \nfirm in December 2019 to help consolidate his debt and work with his creditor to resolve \nhis delinquencies. (The five delinquencies were with the same creditor.) Applicant signed \nan agreement to open a joint account into which Applicant would pay $1,599/month to \nfund the firm\u2019s efforts to resolve his debts. He has adhered to that plan, and as a result \ntwo of the SOR debts have been resolved. Applicant has consistently adhered to that plan \nand continues to make $1,599 monthly payments to fund settlements. Applicant is hopeful \nthat the remaining three SOR debts will be resolved. His consolidation program still has \n22 months to run. \nApplicant has no history of financial problems and has a stable employment record. \nSo these circumstances are unlikely to recur. Applicant\u2019s prompt action to address his \nfinancial straits shows reliability, good judgment, and responsible conduct in confronting \nhis loss of employment, a condition largely beyond his control.

Based on the \nresults of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA \nCAF) could not, as required by Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Section E.4, \nand by DOD Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive), Section 4.2, make an affirmative \ndetermination that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security for \nApplicant to continue to have access to classified information. \nOn January 5, 2021, the DCSA CAF issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts and security concerns addressed under Guideline F (Financial \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConsiderations). The adjudicative guideline (AG) cited in the SOR is among the \nguidelines issued by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) on December 10, 2016, to \nbe effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a decision without \na hearing. On March 9, 2022, as provided for by paragraph E3.1.7 of the Directive, \nDepartment Counsel for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM) containing seven exhibits (Items 1 \u2013 7) on which the \nGovernment relies to support the SOR allegations. \nApplicant received the FORM on March 31, 2022, and was informed she had 30 \ndays from receipt of the FORM to submit additional information. She did not submit \nanything further and the record closed on April 30, 2022. I received the case for decision \non June 17, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant owes $34,239 for six past-due \nor delinquent debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.f). In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted with \nexplanation all of the Guideline F allegations. (FORM, Items 1 and 3) In addition to the \nfacts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 58 years old and is sponsored for a security clearance by her \nemployer, a federal contractor, for whom she has worked since December 2011. In March \n2017, she obtained additional, part-time employment to supplement her federal contractor \nincome. Applicant first received a security clearance in connection with her duties as an \nenlisted member of the United States Army, where she served between 1982 and 1992. \nShe earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2009. (FORM, Item 4) \nApplicant and her husband have been married since October 2002. Her two \nprevious marriages ended by divorce. She has two children, now in their thirties, from her \nfirst marriage. She has no financial ties to either of her ex-husbands. (FORM, Items 4 and \n5) \nIn the remarks section at the end of her April 2021 e-QIP, Applicant disclosed that \nshe was experiencing financial difficulties, but she did not provide any detail about her \ndebts. A credit report obtained by government investigators in May 2021 documented the \ndebts alleged in the SOR. She discussed and acknowledged those debts and her financial \nproblems during two personal subject interviews (PSI) with a government investigator in \nJune 2021. (FORM, Items 4, 5, and 7) \nApplicant attributes her financial problems, initially, to a period of unemployment \nbetween January and November 2011, when she started working for her current \nemployer. The primary cause of her financial problems, however, stems from the loss of \nher husband\u2019s income in 2018 when he had a stroke and became unable to work. He is \nstill unable to return to the workforce and Applicant intends to begin the process of \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplying for Social Security disability benefits on her husband\u2019s behalf. (FORM, Items 3 \nand 4) \nIn response to the SOR, while stating that she is able to meet all of her present \nfinancial obligations, Applicant stated that she still does not have sufficient income with \nwhich to address her delinquencies. She did not present any information that shows she \nhas paid or otherwise addressed her debts. She has not consulted with a professional \nfinancial planner or debt counselor to advise her on how best to rectify her financial \ndifficulties. The debts at SOR 1.a \u2013 1.c consist of past-due student loans totaling $31,380, \nor about 90 percent of the total debt at issue. Applicant has stated her plans to consolidate \nthose debts as part of a student loan rehabilitation program and at least restore them to \na current status with minimal income-based payments. She did not present any \ninformation that shows she has acted on that plan. (FORM, Items 3 and 5) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those \nfactors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988)) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an\napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute,\nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security\nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528,\n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship\n \n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See ----\nEgan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAvailable information supports the allegations that Applicant owes more than \n$34,000 in delinquent or past-due debts. It appears from this record that her debts have \nnot been addressed and that they remain unresolved. This information reasonably raises \nthe security concerns articulated, in relevant part, at AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \nMore specifically, the Government\u2019s information requires application of the \nfollowing AG \u00b6 19 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nI also have considered the following pertinent AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in her response to the SOR, and the rest of the \nGovernment\u2019s information, presented a prima facie case for disqualification. Accordingly, \nit was incumbent on Applicant to present sufficient reliable information on which \napplication of available mitigating conditions could be based. She did not do so. The \nrecord does not support any of the cited mitigating conditions. Her debts are multiple and \nrecent, insofar as they remain unpaid. Applicant\u2019s unemployment ten years ago may \ninitially have caused Applicant financial distress, which in turn was exacerbated by her \nhusband\u2019s stroke and loss of income in 2018. These facts arguably constitute \ncircumstances beyond her control. Nonetheless, Applicant did not establish that she has \nacted responsibly in the face of those circumstances. Applicant\u2019s low level of income \npersists and is an understandable impediment to meaningful repayment; however, she \ndid not establish that she has contacted her student loan creditors, or that she sought any \nadvice or counseling regarding how best to address her financial problems. \nIn summary, Applicant did not meet her burden of persuasion to overcome the \nGovernment\u2019s case for disqualification from access to classified information. I also have \nreviewed the record before me in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 \n2(d). Applicant\u2019s ongoing financial problems leave her at risk of engaging in misconduct \nto resolve her debts. More importantly, her apparent lack of action in response to her \nfinancial problems creates doubts about her judgment and reliability. Because protection \nof the national interest is the principal focus in these adjudications, any remaining doubts \nmust be resolved against allowing access to sensitive information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all available information, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security for Applicant to have access to classified information.

(Item \n3.) On February 11, 2022, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuidelines D, J, E and F. (Item 1.) The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 14, 2022 (Answer), and requested a \ndecision on the record without a hearing. On March 18, 2022, a complete copy of the file \nof relevant material (FORM) was sent to Applicant, including documents identified as \nItems 1 through 4. He was given an opportunity to file objections and submit material to \nrefute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s evidence. He responded to the FORM \n(Response) on April 19, 2022.

Applicant admits that from about January of 2009 to about \nJanuary 2014, he hired an escort service four or five times a year for the purpose of \nengaging in sexual intercourse. Applicant further admits that once in 2019 and once again \nin 2020, he hired an escort service for the purpose of engaging in sexual intercourse. \nApplicant\u2019s spouse and family are not aware of his use of an escort service. \n1.b., and 4.a. Applicant admits that from about 2010 to 2011, he engaged in an \nextramarital affair with a dancer at a strip club for approximately six months.  Applicant\u2019s \nspouse and family are not aware of his extramarital affairs. \n1.c., and 4.a. Applicant admits that from about 2012 to 2013, he engaged in an \nextramarital affair with a dancer at a strip club for approximately nine months.  Applicant\u2019s \nspouse and family are not aware of his extramarital affairs.  \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n3.a. Applicant was indebted to the Federal Government for back taxes for tax year \n2014 in the amount of about $34,594. He is making monthly payments of $1,046 towards \nthis tax arrearage, as documented by correspondence with the Internal Revenue Service \n(IRS). (Response) \n3.b. Applicant was indebted to a state taxing authority for back taxes for tax years \n2013 and 2014 in the amount of about $16,266. He is making monthly payments of $400 \ntowards this tax arrearage, as documented by correspondence with the state taxing \nauthority. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order \nadverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline D - Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Sexual Behavior is set out in AG \n\u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the \nindividual. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 13. All are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior \nthat the individual is unable to stop;  \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \nApplicant received sexual gratification from female employees of an escort service \non multiple occasions over a period of about ten years, ending in 2020. He also had \nlengthy extramarital affairs with two different strip club dancers in 2010~2011, and again \nin 2012~2013. Applicant admits that his conduct was criminal and represents a pattern of \nhigh-risk sexual behavior that reflects a lack of discretion or judgment. As his spouse and \nfamily are still unaware of his sexual behavior, it also creates a vulnerability to coercion, \nas discussed above under Guideline E. The evidence is sufficient to raise these \ndisqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 14 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 14 including: \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \nNone of the above mitigating conditions apply. Paragraph 1 is found against \nApplicant. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 31 contains five disqualifying conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions apply, as discussed below: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant admits that he engaged in illegal sexual conduct over a period of ten \nyears, ending a little more than two years ago. This evidence raises security concerns \nunder these disqualifying conditions, thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to rebut, \nextenuate, or mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 32 contains four conditions that could mitigate criminal \nconduct security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSufficient time has not passed since Applicant\u2019s most recent criminal, sexual \nliaison. Based on those facts, the evidence continues to cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. The evidence does not establish \nmitigation under any of the above conditions. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, as to Federal and state tax delinquencies, establish three \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), AG \n\u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d), and AG \u00b6 19(f) (\u201cfailure to pay \nannual Federal, state, or local taxes as required\u201d). \nApplicant remains indebted to the Federal and state taxing authorities, for back \ntaxes, totaling about $34,000 and about $16,000, respectively. \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors under AG \u00b6 20: \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is established. Applicant is addressing his Federal and state tax \narrearages. Applicant has met his burden to mitigate the financial concerns set out in the \nSOR. For these reasons, I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a. and 3.b. for Applicant. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \nBased on Applicant\u2019s past sexual behavior, the following disqualifying condition \ncould apply under AG \u00b6 16: \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a\nforeign intelligence entity or individual or group. Such conduct includes:  \n \n(1) engaging in activities, which if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional or community standing. \nApplicant, unbeknownst to his spouse and family, had extramarital affairs and \nengaged in illegal prostitution. Therefore, AG \u00b6 16(e) is established. \nThe personal conduct security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by \nthe following potentially applicable factor under AG \u00b6 17: \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant is still subject to exploitation, manipulation and duress, as his family is \nunaware of his sexual behavior. He has not met his burden of proof for his personal \nconduct. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines D, J, F and E in my whole-\nperson analysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines D, J, F and E, and evaluating all \nthe evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not \nmitigated the security concerns raised by his Sexual Behavior, and related Personal and \nCriminal Conduct. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D (Sexual Behavior): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a ~1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a. and 3.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 4.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

The Government\u2019s evidence, included in the FORM \nand identified as Items 1 through 6, is admitted without objection. The case was \nassigned to me on September 6, 2022. Based on my review of the documentary \nevidence, I find that Applicant has not mitigated financial considerations security \nconcerns. \nFindings of Fact \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e \nwith explanations. (Item 2) He is 46 years old, not married with no children. Applicant \ngraduated from the U.S. Military Academy in May 1999, receiving his undergraduate \ndegree. He served as an active duty officer from May 1999 to August 2004. In 2016, he \nattended a technical school, but did not receive a degree. Applicant has been \nemployed by his current employer since January 2018. He completed a security \nclearance application on January 23, 2020. Applicant first received a security clearance \nwhile serving in the U.S. Army. (Item 3) \nFinancial Considerations \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has five delinquent debts totaling approximately \n$50,000 (Item 4) The allegations are supported by his admissions and credit reports. \n(Items 4, and 5) \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant attributed his financial problems to helping \nhis brother, who was out of work. Applicant was also unemployed in 2016. Applicant \nwas terminated due to a DUI he incurred in 2016. He then worked selling windows and \nroofs and received commission from August 2017 to January 2018. (Item 3) He earned \nabout $500 a month. He used a credit card to pay for his living expenses. Applicant \nreported unemployment from February 2017 to July 2017. He also experienced earlier \nunemployment for a period in 2011 and 2012. \nIn his personal subject interview in May 2021, Applicant explained his termination \nfrom employment in 2016, a job that did not require a security clearance. Applicant told \nthe investigator and disclosed on his SCA that he was arrested and found guilty of a \u2013 \nfirst offense DUI in October 2016 and spent time in jail. He had another incident (open \ncontainer) in September 2018. He successfully completed an alcohol program in 2011. \nHe has never been diagnosed as being alcohol dependent. \nApplicant\u2019s monthly gross salary is $7,200. After monthly expenses, his net \nremainder is $3,400. He listed a monthly payment of $238 for one of the SOR debts in \nhis expenses and also listed a car payment. There is no record of financial counseling \nor a budget. \nAs to SOR 1.a, a charged-off-account in the amount of $10,728, Applicant used \nthis credit card to pay for his living expenses. He fell behind in the payments due to \nunemployment and underemployment. He has not made any payments on the debt.

(Item 6) \nAs to SOR 1.b, a charged-off-account in the amount of $9,040, Applicant used \nthis credit card to pay for living expenses during the same time period. He has not made \nany payments. He promised to call the collection agency and pay the debt. (Item 6) \nAs to SOR 1.c, a charged-off- account in the amount of $8,734, Applicant used \nthe credit card for daily expenses. No payments have been made, but he promised to \nbecome proactive and try to settle the debt. (Item 6) \nAs to SOR 1.d, a charged-off-account in the amount of $8,184, Applicant settled \nthe account and stated that he has been paying $238 a month. He expects the account \nto be paid by May 2021. The plan term was two years. He did not present any evidence \nof the payments. \nAs to SOR 1.e, a charged-off-account in the amount of $17,860, Applicant did not \nknow what the account represented. He recalls starting a debt consolidation plan but \nnever completed the process. (Item 6) \nThe credit report dated December 17, 2020, shows several accounts as \u201cpaying \nas agreed\u201d, or under a partial payment plan. (Item 5) It confirms that Applicant has paid \nsix other accounts that are not listed on the SOR that have been paid in 2019. It also \nshows that Applicant has been paying on another account under a payment plan and \nthe balance has decreased. (Item 5) \nAlso, Applicant reported to the investigator that another account SOR (1.c) \nconcerned a short sale that ended in the summer of 2015. Applicant was notified that he \nno longer had to pay toward the short sale and he was reimbursed a total of $25,351. \n(Item 6) There is no evidence in the record to substantiate his claim. \nApplicant did not provide any documentation to demonstrate that he is taking \nsteps to resolve his delinquent debts. He intends to pay his debts, and has shown in the \npast that he could. \n Policies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, establish disqualifying \nconditions under the guidelines: AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), and 19(c) \u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant admitted that he is responsible for the remaining delinquent debts and \nintends to pay them. Promises to pay in the future are not sufficient for mitigation \npurposes. Applicant is now earning a salary and experienced some unemployment, but \nhe did not present any evidence to meet his burden of proof. His earlier credit report \nshows that he had paid some accounts. The Government is not a bill collector. \nHowever, Applicant in this case has not shown that he acted responsibly and in good-\nfaith to repay financial obligations. He has not shown the requisite judgment, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, to have access to classified information. He has not met his burden \nand none of the mitigating conditions apply. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. Applicant served in the U.S. military and \nexperienced unemployment and underemployment. Granted he was terminated from his \njob for a DUI, but he has been consistently employed since 2018. He paid other \ndelinquent accounts that he incurred from loss of employment. However, he has not \nmade sufficient efforts to pay and resolve his debts to mitigate the financial security \nconcerns guideline. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u20131e: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

On April 1, 2021, she provided a personal subject \ninterview (PSI, Item 4) to an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management \n(OPM). On December 3, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence Security Agency \n(DCSA) could not make the necessary affirmative finding to grant Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance and issued an SOR to her detailing security reasons under the financial \nconsiderations guideline (Guideline F).

The case file was assigned to me on October \n3, 2022. \nRulings on Procedure \nIn a footnote on the second page of the FORM, Department Counsel informed \nApplicant that her April 1, 2021 PSI (Item 4) would be excluded from evidence if she \nobjected to the exhibit. Alternatively, Department Counsel advised her that she could \ncorrect, update, or modify the exhibit to improve its clarity or accuracy. Applicant did not \nobject to this exhibit or any of the other four items. See, E3.1.20. of DOD Directive \n5220.6, page 52. All items were admitted into evidence. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR contains two delinquent medical accounts and a delinquent \nmortgage. The SOR \u00b6 1.a medical account became delinquent in September 2019, the \nSOR \u00b6 1.b medical account, in November 2018. The mortgage account (SOR \u00b6 1.(c)) \nfell delinquent in July 2021. The total amount of delinquent debt is $89,929. Applicant \nadmitted the past-due accounts. \nApplicant is 40 years old and has been married to her second husband since \n2015. She has two adult-aged children, ages 21 and 18, and a stepson, 26 years old. \nHer husband is the caretaker for his parents and he has had health issues since 2012. \nApplicant has owned her home (SOR \u00b6 1(c)) since 1997. She earned college credits \nfrom September 1994 to November 1994, from March 1993 to December 1998, and \nfrom April 2006 to April 2009, without receiving a degree. (Item 3 at 10-11, 19-20, 24-\n29) \nJanuary 2021 e-QIP (Item 3) \nSince October 2009, Applicant has been working for a staffing organization. \nShe identifies her position as a \u201c\u2018PEBLO.\u2019\u201d No additional information was provided \nconcerning the nature of her employment. On-line research reveals that her employer \nprovides staffing solutions, i.e., locating qualified personnel to fill positions for large and \nsmall businesses.

From January 2004 to June 2005, \nApplicant was a medical office assistant. (Item 1 at 12-16) \nApplicant revealed that she has never had a security clearance. She noted that \nshe worked at a job for 11 years and had to fill out and submit background paperwork \nmore than once. After reviewing her listed employment, she must be referring to her \ncurrent position. When she inquired about the outcome of the background checks, she \nwas told the paperwork was lost, then she was informed that the background checks \nyielded positive results. No additional information was provided. (Item 3 at 41) \nApplicant indicated that she was delinquent on the three accounts listed in the \nSOR. Regarding the medical accounts, she stated she was trying to pay them off. Her \npayment efforts for these debts and the mortgage have been frustrated by her \nhusband\u2019s unemployment for the last two years and his health problems since 2012. \nShe was considering selling the home. Applicant claimed that she signed up for a credit \ncounseling service and was in the process of collecting account information so that the \nservice could process the delinquent accounts. (Item 3 at 41-46) \nApril 2021 PSI (Item 4) \nIn Applicant\u2019s April 2021 PSI, she indicated that she had not signed up or \nstarted the credit counseling service as she stated in January 2021 e-QIP. She incurred \nthe SOR \u00b6 1.(a) medical debt because she had no medical insurance for the services \nshe received. She claimed that she was under a payment plan with the SOR \u00b6 1.a \ncollection agency and was paying what she could. She indicated that she had not made \narrangements with the SOR \u00b6 1.(b) collection agency, but intended to establish a \npayment plan. Regarding SOR \u00b6 1.c, Applicant claimed that her application to refinance \nthe mortgage was pending. She mentioned that she was looking for part-time work to \nearn additional income. She insisted she was willing to pay off the overdue debts. (Item \n4 at 4-5) \nItem 2 - Undated Answer to SOR  \nAlong with her husband\u2019s unemployment and medical issues that she referenced \nin her PSI, and her e-QIP, Applicant explained in her undated answer (Item 2) that she \nincurred financial problems when she lost Social Security benefits after her children \nmoved out of her home. The loss of benefits reduced her income although her mortgage \n(SOR \u00b6 1.(c)) was never adjusted downward. Without hurricane insurance, Applicant \nwas not reimbursed for repairs she made because of damage caused by several \nhurricanes over the years. As she stated earlier in the security investigation, she was \ntrying to refinance or sell her home. Though she stated in her PSI that she was not \nparticipating in credit counseling, she mentioned in her Answer that she had changed \nher mind and decided to join the credit counseling service. (Item 2) \nDuring the course of the security investigation, Applicant waffled on the subject \nof credit counseling. She has not provided any documentation that proves she engaged \n3 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nin any credit counseling services. She claims she is in a payment plan with the SOR \u00b6 \n1.a collection agency, but provided no independent evidence of a plan or payments that \nshe has made. The same is true for the SOR \u00b6 1.b collection agency. There is no \nevidence that Applicant has taken any steps to bring her mortgage back to a current \nstatus or to sell the property, and she has not furnished updated information on the \nrefinancing of the mortgage. Applicant did not address her attempts to find part-time \nwork. Other than describing her financial situation as strained (Item 4 at 4-5), Applicant \nfailed to present information that specifically shows how she has tailored her spending \nand other financial habits to account for her husband\u2019s medical issues since 2012 and \nhis unemployment since 2019.  \nPolicies/ \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines and all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. These guidelines, which are flexible rules of law, are applied together with \ncommon sense and the general factors of the whole-person concept. The protection of \nthe national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny \ndoubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be \nresolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n4 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s two delinquent medical accounts and a delinquent mortgage total \nalmost $90,000. She has made repeated claims about her efforts to repay the medical \naccounts and sell her home. The accounts remain delinquent. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) \napply. \nAG \u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nThough only three listed accounts became delinquent less than four years ago, \nthe accounts are still delinquent. Without evidence of successful financial habits, and \nacquisition of medical insurance, the surrounding circumstances in which these \naccounts arose imply a continuation of similar financial difficulties in the future. AG \u00b6 \n20(a) does not apply. \nThe first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies because of the unemployment of \nApplicant\u2019s husband. Her husband\u2019s medical condition, as well as her medical condition, \nrequiring treatment she could not pay for, provides additional mitigation under the first \nprong of the condition. However, the overall benefit to Applicant under AG \u00b6 20(b) is \nlimited due to the lack of evidence of documented action to responsibly resolve the \ndelinquent debts. AG \u00b6 20(d), requiring a good-faith effort to repay creditors, is \nunavailable for mitigation. \n5 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not applicable because Applicant has not received financial \ncounseling. If, as she contends, she finally signed on for the credit counseling she \npreviously declined during the security investigation, she provided no documented proof \nof participation in the counseling service. There is no evidence the debts are being \nresolved or under control. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the guideline for financial considerations in \nthe context of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant is 40 years and has been married since 2015. She has two adult-age \nchildren and one adult-age step child. Though she provided no documentation \nconcerning the quality of her work, the fact that she has been employed for over 12 \nyears by the same employer deserves some acknowledgment. \nThe foregoing favorable evidence is insufficient to support Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance application. As noted throughout the course of the security investigation and \nthis decision, Applicant has made several repeated claims of having a payment plan in \nplace and making payments under the plan. Her assertions are not credible because of \nthe lack of independent evidence, e.g., cancelled checks, pay stubs or receipts, bank \nledger entries, or other documentation confirming that Applicant made payments to the \nlisted creditors. \nIn Guideline F cases, the DOHA Appeal Board has held in a long line of cases \nthat an applicant must present a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt repayments that \nresult in debt reduction. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, \n2007) While an applicant is not required to show that every debt listed in the SOR is \npaid, the applicant must show that she has a plan for debt resolution and has taken \nsignificant action to implement the plan. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2 (App. \nBd. Jun. 5, 2006) From the record presented. Applicant has no plan in place and \nfurnished no evidence of even sporadic payments on the medical accounts when she \nwas able to pay. Her promises to pay the delinquent debts are insufficient. See, e.g., \n6 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nISCR Case No. 14-04656 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2015). Having considered the entire \nrecord from an overall common-sense point of view, Applicant\u2019s ongoing financial \nstruggles have not been mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

The Government\u2019s \nwritten brief with supporting documents, known as the file of relevant material (FORM), \nwas submitted by Department Counsel on January 31, 2022. A complete copy of the \nFORM was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file objections and \nsubmit material to refute, rebut, or mitigate the security concerns. Applicant received the \nFORM on February 15, 2022. He did not respond to the FORM, object to the \nGovernment\u2019s exhibits, or submit additional documentary evidence for my consideration. \nThe case was assigned to me on April 12, 2022. Government Exhibits (GE) 2 and 3 are \nadmitted into evidence without objection. GE 1 is the SOR and Applicant\u2019s Answer, which \nare already part of the record. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 56-year-old process senior network systems engineer, employed by \na defense contractor since 2019. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1991. He married in \n1994 and divorced in 2015. He remarried in 2018 and has two adult children. This is his \nfirst security clearance application. \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in \nDecember 2015, that was discharged in 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Under Guideline H, Applicant \nused marijuana with varying frequency from about October 2018 to present (SOR \u00b6 2.a); \nand that he intends to continue using marijuana (SOR \u00b6 2.b). Applicant admitted the SOR \nallegations with explanations. \nApplicant explained in his Answer to the SOR, that he filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy \non the advice of his attorney and by agreement in his divorce, to avoid lifetime alimony \npayments to his ex-spouse. As part of the divorce decree, Applicant compiled joint credit-\ncard debts attributed to his marriage, and filed bankruptcy to extinguish the debts. The \nbankruptcy was discharged in in 2016, and he stated that since that time, he has never \nbeen late on a payment, never failed to make a payment when due, and successfully met \nall financial obligations. He does not carry significant debt and contributes regularly to \nsavings and retirement accounts. \nIn 2017, Applicant was diagnosed with Crohn\u2019s disease, a progressive \nautoimmune disease that affects the digestive tract, and causes inflammation, pain, \nscarring of intestinal tissue, nutritional deficiency, and immunodeficiency. In consultation \nwith his doctor, he began using medicinal cannabis in 2018 as a treatment that he claims \nhas been successful. His treatment includes extracted oil cannabis capsules in 12mg \ndoses, which he takes every evening, along with an anti-inflammatory prescription drug. \nApplicant believes he is now tolerant of the marijuana and he no longer experiences any \nphysical or mental impairment from the cannabis capsules.

Although some states within the United States have allowed the use of \nmarijuana for medicinal purpose, it is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that has the \nfederal authority to approve drugs for medicinal use in the U.S. To date, the FDA has not \napproved a marketing application for any marijuana product for any clinical indication. \nConsistent therewith, the FDA and DEA have concluded that marijuana has no federally \napproved medical use for treatment in the U.S. and thus it remains as a Schedule I \ncontrolled substance under federal law. See, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration Fact \nSheet; https://www.dea.gov/sites/default/files/2020-06/Marijuana-Cannabis-2020 0.pdf. \nIn addition to the above matters, I note that the Director of National Intelligence \n(DNI) issued an October 25, 2014 memorandum concerning adherence to federal laws \nprohibiting marijuana use. In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state \ncan authorize violations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances \nAct, which identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Second, changes to state \nlaw (and the laws of the District of Columbia) concerning marijuana use do not alter the \nnational security adjudicative guidelines. And third, a person\u2019s disregard of federal law \nconcerning the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains relevant when making \neligibility decisions for sensitive national security positions. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information.

Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01\u00ad\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, and the documentary evidence in the record are sufficient \nto establish the disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 19(b). \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2015 incident to a divorce agreement and \nwith the advice of counsel. He did so to avoid alimony payments pursuant to a divorce. \nEssentially, this was a financial planning maneuver that Applicant claims is common in \nhis state to avoid a legal obligation for lifetime alimony payments in a divorce. His joint \ncredit-card debts incurred during their marriage were included in the Chapter 7, and the \nbankruptcy court discharged the debts in 2016. Bankruptcy is a recognized, legal method \nto discharge debts. There is no evidence in the record that Applicant has incurred \nadditional debt or has any financial problems since the bankruptcy discharge. \nApplicant\u2019s past financial issues no longer cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good financial judgment. Overall, Applicant\u2019s financial responsibility \nis not questionable. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (b) apply to mitigate this security concern. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition), and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant has used medicinal marijuana since October 2018, and intends to \ncontinue using it to treat his medical condition. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and (g) apply. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the mitigating conditions, and find none applicable. \nApplicant has a history of medical marijuana use since 2018 by agreement with \nhis doctor and with a state-issued medical marijuana permit. Federal law prohibits the use \nof marijuana, regardless of state law. The Directive and AGs clearly prohibit illegal drug \nuse among cleared personnel and those applying for a security clearance. Applicant\u2019s \nintent to continue to use marijuana precludes his security eligibility. No mitigating \ncondition applies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guidelines F and H in my whole-person analysis. I considered \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and explanations, along with the medical record and state medical \nmarijuana card attached. Applicant was straightforward and honest about his use of \nmedical marijuana and the reasons for its use. However, marijuana remains illegal under \nFederal law and for cleared individuals. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Accordingly, I conclude he \nhas not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national security \ninterests of the United States to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \namended, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H: \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \n Subparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Subparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance is denied. \nGregg A.
