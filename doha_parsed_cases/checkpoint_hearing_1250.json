Applicant did not provide sufficient information to \nmitigate the Guideline E security concern arising from his use of countermeasures \nduring an October 2017 polygraph examination. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on September 16, \n2017. On October 23, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nsecurity concerns under Guideline E, personal conduct, and Guideline K, handling \nprotected information. DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective June 8, 2017.  \n \n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 5, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). The case was assigned to me on June 14, 2019. On July 19, 2019, DOHA \nissued a notice scheduling the hearing for September 10, 2019.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s hearing was held as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1-4. Applicant and one other witness testified. Applicant \nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A-H. All exhibits were admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the transcript on September 19, 2019.  \n \nWithdrawal of SOR Allegation \n \n \nDepartment Counsel withdrew SOR \u00b6 1.b, noting that it was not supported by \nrecord evidence. (Tr. 9-10)  \n \nFindings of Fact  \n \n \nApplicant denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b (later withdrawn), and 2.b. He admitted SOR \u00b6 \n2.a. His admission is incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings and the record evidence, I make the following additional findings \nof fact.  \n \nApplicant is 32 years old. He married in late 2012. He has an associate degree in \nengineering and is pursuing a bachelor\u2019s degree. He has worked for his current \nemployer, in the defense industry, since February 2018. He needs a clearance for his \njob. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from 2007 to 2016, with a clearance, and \nis currently in the Navy Reserve as a first class petty officer (E-6). He has been \nawarded four Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals. (Tr. 33-35, 55-57, 64, 84-\n85; GE 1; AE B-H) \n \nWhile on active duty in the Navy, Applicant was a crewman on Navy helicopters. \nHe deployed overseas in 2009, for about seven months; in 2010, for about six or seven \nmonths; and in 2011, for about eight months. He had no overseas deployments after \nthat. (Tr. 36, 41, 55-57, 64-65) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that between 2010 and 2014, Applicant knowingly divulged \nclassified information to his spouse, without authorization. In his Answer, Applicant \ndenied the allegation, asserting that he never knowingly divulged classified information. \n \nApplicant met his future wife in 2005. He testified that while they had met prior to \nhis first two deployments (2009 and 2010), they were not dating, so they were not in \nclose communication at that time. (Tr. 42) They became a couple in 2011, and were in \nclose contact during his third deployment, in 2011. They married in late 2012. (Tr. 69-\n70)  \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant noted in his Answer that his future wife was concerned about his safety \nwhen he went on missions. When they spoke, he told her about some of his duties while \non missions, because she knew that some duties he had to perform were more \ndangerous than others. (Answer; Tr. 73-74) He also told her if he had a \u201cmorning flight\u201d \nor a \u201cnight flight,\u201d so she could know approximately when she might hear from him later \nthat day, or at all, given the time difference with the United States. (Tr. 37-40, 44, 68, \n73-74) He testified that other than the name of the mission, he never discussed specific \ntimeframes, locations, or other mission particulars with his wife, such as \u201cexact flying \ntimes.\u201d Rather he gave \u201cballpark\u201d estimates. (Tr. 40, 62) Applicant also noted in his \nAnswer that he should have been more careful about what he told his wife about his \nwork, as \u201cothers could have been listening,\u201d including terrorists. (Answer) \n \nApplicant left the Navy in November 2016. He then applied for a job with another \ngovernment agency (AGA). The job application process included a polygraph \nexamination. (Tr. 45) Applicant testified that he was told not to do any research on how \nto \u201cbeat a polygraph,\u201d either on the Internet, or from movies or television. (Tr. 46-48, 80-\n81) He said he was told \u201cto go in there and, you know, just be myself, and that\u2019s what I \ndid.\u201d (Tr. 47) \n \nApplicant denied getting information about polygraphs from movies and television \nshows, either in preparation for the polygraph or earlier. He testified that he has been an \nathlete since high school. He said that through both athletic and military training, he \nlearned how to \u201cslow and deepen\u201d his breaths after exercising to slow his heart rate \ndown. (Tr. 82-83)  \n \nApplicant reported for the polygraph in October 2017. (GE 2, 3, 4) SOR \u00b6 2.a \nalleges that he \u201cdeliberately attempted to control his breathing in order to slow his heart \nrate\u201d during the polygraph. In his Answer, Applicant admitted that he had tried to slow \ndown his heart rate. He said he \u201cfelt very nervous, like standing up in front of a crowd. I \nwas attempting to slow my heartrate down. I have always done this when giving a \nspeech. It felt like a very intense situation to me.\u201d (Answer; Tr. 63) Applicant similarly \ntestified that he was \u201ca nervous wreck,\u201d and he was \u201cjust trying to re-gather myself\u201d and \n\u201ckind of calm myself down.\u201d (Tr. 44, 49, 62-63) Applicant denied that his attempts to \ncontrol his breathing by breathing deeper were an attempt to influence the outcome of \nthe polygraph. (Tr. 50) \n \nApplicant testified that after the polygraph, the examiner told him he had failed, \nand asked him if he had \u201canything else\u201d he wanted to add. (Tr. 50-51, 76) He said he \nwas given a choice, either to retake the polygraph or to provide a sworn statement. \nApplicant then made additional disclosures, detailed in a contemporaneous sworn \nstatement. (Tr. 52, 54, 76, 78-79)  \n \nIn the sworn statement, Applicant said, \u201cDuring the polygraph exam, I was trying \nto control my breathing to slow my heart rate down. I had held back information that I \nlater told [the examiner], and included in this statement.\u201d (GE 3 at 2)  Applicant stated \nthat he \u201cfelt I had to pass the poly exam, so [I] decided to try to control my heart rate, \n\n \n4 \n \n \nwhich just caused me to need to breathe deeper during other questions. I let information \nabout polygraph exams I learned from movies and TV shows cloud my head. The \npurpose I was trying to control my breathing to pass the exam only.\u201d [Sic] (GE 3 at 2) \n \nApplicant also stated:  \n \nI mentioned classified information secret level to my wife, during my 3 \ndeployments to [the Middle East]. Information was details about mission \nspecifications, trying to make her understand what I was doing, so she did \nnot cause additional stress. It provided a decompression for me as well. \n[It] happened during the years 2010-2014. I mentioned and was stern \nabout her not repeating anything to anybody. (GE 3 at 1; Tr. 62) \n \nApplicant testified that when he wrote in his sworn statement that, \u201cI mentioned \nclassified information\u201d to his wife, and then added the words \u201csecret level\u201d later. (Tr. 57-\n58) My viewing of GE 3 comports with this. He testified that he added those words at \nthe prompting of the examiner. (Tr. 57-58) Applicant acknowledged during his testimony \nthat he wrote GE 3, signed it, and had a chance to review it before he did so. (Tr. 75) \n \nApplicant also testified that he was unsure if the information he disclosed to his \nfuture wife was \u201cclassified\u201d or \u201csensitive,\u201d and at one point said the information might \nhave been \u201cneither.\u201d (Tr. 57-60, 72) Applicant also testified that other air crew members \nshared similar information with their spouses or parents. (Tr. 40, 61) He said, \u201cI strongly \nbelieve that what I shared with my wife was not inappropriate or sensitive to the nature \nof the mission.\u201d (Tr. 72) \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.b, which Applicant denied, alleges that Applicant \u201cwithheld information\u201d \nduring the polygraph. The language in SOR \u00b6 2.b does not specify what information was \nallegedly withheld. There was no testimony at the hearing from the polygraph examiner \nthat might have shed light on this allegation. There is only the sentence in GE 3 in which \nApplicant stated that he \u201cheld back information that I later told [the examiner], and \nincluded in this statement.\u201d \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant denied withholding information from the examiner. He \ntestified that he provided honest answers. (Tr. 53) He testified that he was not asked a \nquestion during the polygraph that would have led him to truthfully disclose the \ninformation he told his wife. He said he was asked, \u201cDid I intentionally or knowingly \ndisclose any classified information? And the answer is, \u2018no, I have definitely not done \nthat.\u2019\u201d (Tr. 77)  \n \nThe polygraph report from the AGA notes that Applicant \u201cadmitted to employing \ncountermeasures during the examination,\u201d and noted that he \u201cadmitted to engaging in a \ndeliberate attempt to alter the natural outcome of the examination.\u201d The \u201cExam Result\u201d \nis noted as \u201cNo Opinion \u2013 Countermeasures.\u201d (GE 2) Applicant received a tentative job \noffer from the AGA, but it was revoked following the polygraph. (Tr. 83) \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s former supervisor testified. He called Applicant \u201cone of the best men \nI\u2019ve ever had work for me.\u201d He said that Applicant\u2019s work performance was outstanding \nand exemplary. He testified that Applicant is honest, of high character, is very \ntrustworthy, and should be eligible for a clearance. (Tr. 23-33; AE A)  \n \nA Navy lieutenant in Applicant\u2019s unit provided a reference letter in which he \nattested to Applicant\u2019s growth, talent, responsibility, maturity, professionalism, integrity, \nintelligence, and \u201cstrong ethical compass.\u201d He regards Applicant as a tremendous asset \nto any government agency and deserving of the public\u2019s trust. (AE A) \n \nA friend and co-worker attested that Applicant is smart, talented, and \nresponsible. Applicant has a high degree of integrity and ambitiousness. He is \nprofessional and has excellent communications skills. (AE A) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n\n \n6 \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGiven the nature of the allegations, I note the following about the hearing and the \nrecord evidence:  \n \nThe hearing was unclassified. I therefore instructed the participants at the outset \nthat no classified information was to be discussed, revealed, or otherwise introduced. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant divulged certain classified information to his wife, \nwithout authorization. There is no documentary evidence in the record of that \ninformation itself, classified or otherwise. The only record evidence of the information at \nissue in SOR \u00b6 1.a is from Applicant himself: in his Answer; in a sworn statement (GE \n3), which references certain information as being \u201cclassified;\u201d and in his hearing \ntestimony, which addressed, in general terms, the nature of the information.  \n \nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information  \n \nAG \u00b6 33 details the Guideline K security concern:  \n \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information \u2013 which includes classified and other \nsensitive government information, and proprietary information - raises \ndoubt about an individual's trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or \nwillingness and ability to safeguard such information, and is a serious \nsecurity concern. \n \nSecurity clearance cases require administrative judges to assess whether an \napplicant has the requisite good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness to be \nentrusted with classified information. When evidence is presented that an applicant \npreviously mishandled classified information or violated a rule or regulation for the \nprotection of protected information such an applicant bears a heavy burden in \ndemonstrating that he or she should once again be found eligible for a security \nclearance. ISCR Case No. 11-12202 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 23, 2014). \n  \n\n \n7 \n \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 34 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate or negligent disclosure of protected information to \nunauthorized persons, including, but not limited to, personal or business \ncontacts . . . ; and  \n \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or other \nsensitive information. \n \nWhen Applicant was serving in the Navy as a helicopter crewman, he deployed \noverseas in 2009, 2010, and 2011. During some of this period, Applicant and his future \nwife were in a close relationship and in close and frequent contact, at least during his \nthird deployment, in 2011. I consider the reference to the \u201c2010-2014\u201d in both SOR \u00b6 \n1.a and in GE 3 to be a general timeframe. Given Applicant\u2019s testimony that he did not \nreturn to the overseas location after 2011, later dates are likely erroneous. I also \nconsider that when Applicant referred to his \u201cwife\u201d in discussing the timeframe of this \nallegation, as he did in the Answer, the sworn statement, and in his testimony, he \nactually meant his \u201cfuture wife,\u201d since they are the same person. \n \nDuring some of their phone calls with his future wife during the 2011 deployment, \nApplicant told her certain information about his roles and responsibilities, and also \ninformation such as whether the missions were \u201cmorning flights\u201d or \u201cnight flights.\u201d He did \nthis in an attempt to put her mind at ease about his missions and duties, and to give \nsome indication about when she might hear from him again. \n \nApplicant indicated in his post-polygraph sworn statement that he provided \n\u201cclassified information [at the] secret level\u201d to his (future) wife during these \nconversations. At his hearing, he hedged significantly about the nature of the \ninformation he disclosed to her, noting that he was unsure if the information was \n\u201cclassified\u201d or \u201csensitive,\u201d and at one point said the information might have been \n\u201cneither.\u201d He also testified that other air crew members shared similar information with \nclose family members. Applicant\u2019s testimony on these points is unsupported. However, \nas noted above, the only record evidence that the information was \u201cclassified\u201d is \nApplicant\u2019s own sworn statement, GE 3. \n \nApplicant\u2019s disclosures of mission-oriented information to his future wife during \ndeployment may have been with the best of intentions. It may have been common \npractice among members of his unit. It may, in fact, have involved information that while \nsensitive, was not actually classified. But that is not established by the record in this \ncase. GE 3 is a sworn statement from Applicant that he wrote, reviewed, had an \nopportunity to edit, and signed. In the sworn statement, Applicant also acknowledged \nthat he disclosed classified information to his future wife. Further, he added the words \n\u201csecret level\u201d while reviewing the document. Given these circumstances, the evidence \nsupports a conclusion that Applicant believed when he made his sworn statement that \nthe information he disclosed was, in fact, classified. Such evidence is sufficient for the \n\n \n8 \n \n \npurposes of making a clearance decision. AG \u00b6\u00b6 34(a) and (g) apply, even if the \ninformation was sensitive and unclassified, as there is no indication that his future wife \nwas authorized to receive it. \n \nThe following conditions could potentially mitigate security concerns in AG \u00b6 35: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \nsecurity responsibilities;  \n \n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training or \nunclear instructions; and \n \n \n(d) the violation was inadvertent, it was promptly reported, there is no \nevidence of compromise, and it does not suggest a pattern. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s disclosures to his future wife while on deployment did not come to \nlight when he made them. Thus, there was no determination made by security \nauthorities about whether the disclosures constituted security violations, whether there \nwas a compromise, or whether his disclosures were part of a pattern. Applicant was \nalso not in position to be counseled or retrained. AG \u00b6\u00b6 35(b), (c), and (d) therefore do \nnot fully apply.  \n \n \n \nRegardless of the level of restrictions on the information Applicant disclosed to \nhis future wife, and regardless of whether it was commonplace for others to have \ndisclosed similar information to their family members, Applicant recognizes he should \nnot have done it. In his Answer to the SOR, he admitted that he should have been more \naware of who might have been listening to their conversations, and he is now more \ncognizant of the need to avoid such disclosures. The disclosures also occurred during a \ndeployment in 2011 \u2013 about eight years before the hearing. There is also no indication \nthat they have been repeated. AG \u00b6 35(a) therefore applies.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \n\n \n9 \n \n \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a \nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or \nreleases, cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or \npolygraph examination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n   \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information, or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official . . . or other government representative. \n \nApplicant testified that he was a \u201cnervous wreck\u201d when he took the polygraph \nexamination, and that he was \u201cjust trying to re-gather myself\u201d and \u201ckind of calm myself \ndown.\u201d He admitted that he attempted to control his breathing in an effort to slow his \nheart rate during the October 2017 polygraph. (SOR \u00b6 2.a) He denied, however, that \nthese attempts to control his breathing by breathing deeper were an attempt to influence \nthe outcome of the polygraph. However, in his sworn statement, he acknowledged that \nhe \u201cfelt I had to pass the polygraph, so decided to try to control my heart rate, which just \ncaused me to need to breathe deeper during other questions.\u201d Applicant\u2019s sworn \nstatement therefore contradicts his hearing testimony on this point.  \n \nIn both Applicant\u2019s sworn statement and his testimony, he noted that he learned \ninformation about polygraphs from movies and television shows, but he did not provide \nany specifics about where he learned such information. He denied doing any pre-\npolygraph research in this regard. Applicant also testified that he used breathing \ntechniques that he learned as an athlete and during his military training, to control his \nbreathing and lower his heart rate during the polygraph.  \n \nUnder \n\u201cExam \nResult,\u201d \nthe \npolygraph \nreport \nstates, \n\u201cNo \nOpinion: \nCountermeasures.\u201d Under Appeal Board precedent, I am not permitted to consider the \nresults of a polygraph report. See ISCR Case No. 15-07539 at 5, n. 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, \n2018)(\u201cThe actual polygraph results are not disclosed in the record, and, in any event, \nare not proper matters for our consideration. Statements made in response to \nquestioning during a polygraph examination are admissible, although the results of the \nexam itself are not.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-31428 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2006)). \n\n \n10 \n \n \nHere, though, it is not the results of the polygraph I am considering, but rather \nthat there were no results \u2013 because Applicant used countermeasures. I discount \nApplicant\u2019s testimony that the examiner told him he \u201cfailed\u201d the polygraph. He testified \nthat he was offered another opportunity to take it. This suggests not that he failed the \nfirst test, but that the results were somehow corrupted or incomplete. The fact that \nApplicant was found to have used countermeasures (and also admitted doing so) is not \nonly admissible and relevant, it is a fact of security significance. In ISCR Case No. 11-\n03452 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2012) the Appeal Board held that using countermeasures to \ninfluence the outcome of a polygraph exam constitutes a Guideline E security concern. \nSuch conduct evidences not only poor judgment, but also a failure to cooperate with the \nsecurity clearance process under AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and 15(a).  \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges that Applicant intentionally withheld information during the \npolygraph. The allegation does not detail what information Applicant allegedly withheld. \nThe polygraph examiner did not testify. There is only the sentence in GE 3 in which \nApplicant stated that he \u201cheld back information that I later told [the examiner], and \nincluded in this statement.\u201d  \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant denied withholding information from the examiner. He \ntestified that he provided honest answers. (Tr. 53) Applicant testified that he was not \nasked a question during the polygraph that would have led him to truthfully disclose the \ninformation he told his wife. He said he was asked, \u201cDid I intentionally or knowingly \ndisclose any classified information? And the answer is, \u2018no, I have definitely not done \nthat.\u2019\u201d \n \nI find that SOR \u00b6 2.b, which Applicant denied, does not set forth with sufficient \nspecificity the information Applicant allegedly withheld during the polygraph. Further, the \nsworn statement, by itself, does not provide sufficient information on this point to \nestablish disqualifying conduct.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 sets forth the applicable mitigating conditions under Guideline E:   \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and  \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged during his post-polygraph sworn statement that he used \ncountermeasures during the exam and withheld information from the examiner. The \nsworn statement was prepared shortly after Applicant was told by the examiner that (in \nApplicant\u2019s words) he had \u201cfailed\u201d the exam. AG \u00b6 17(a) therefore has some application.  \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \nBut Applicant\u2019s attempt to impact the results by trying to control his breathing is \nnot minor. The Appeal Board considers that breathing efforts such as what Applicant did \nto be countermeasures and also a failure to cooperate. Further, the fact that under \nGuideline E AG \u00b6\u00b6 15(a) and (b), such acts \u201cwill normally result in an unfavorable \nnational security determination\u201d precludes application of AG \u00b6 17(c).  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines E and K in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nThe sole surviving Guideline K allegation is based on a sworn statement from \nApplicant himself, and not on independent evidence, documented or otherwise. The \nsworn statement is enough, in this forum, to support a finding that the information \nApplicant disclosed to his future wife was classified. Any disclosures of classified \ninformation to unauthorized recipients are problematic.  But the sole Guideline K \nallegation here is mitigated: first, because of its age; second, because there is no \nevidence of repeated conduct; and third, because Applicant now has a better \nunderstanding of the security risk of such disclosures.  \n \nOf the two Guideline E allegations, one of them is not established with sufficient \nspecificity, given Applicant\u2019s denial, and the state of the record evidence. This leaves \nthe Guideline E allegation that Applicant admits \u2013 that he attempted to control his \nbreathing during the polygraph exam. At hearing, he denied that his actions were an \nattempt to impact the results of the exam. In his sworn statement, however, he said \notherwise.  \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \nLike Applicant\u2019s disclosures on deployment, his actions during the polygraph may \nalso have been taken with the best of intentions. But the fact remains he acknowledged \nusing countermeasures to influence the result of the polygraph. This was an act of poor \njudgment, and one the Appeal Board regards as security significant. And unlike the \ndisclosures to his future wife while on deployment, Applicant\u2019s actions during the \npolygraph are also quite recent, as they occurred in October 2017.  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s hearing testimony and the other record evidence he \nprovided, particularly his explanations about his rationale for his actions. I also \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s whole-person character evidence, including the strong testimony \nof his former supervisor, as well as the other whole-person evidence provided.  \n \nOn the whole, despite this favorable evidence, I conclude that Applicant has not \nmitigated the security concern shown by his use of countermeasures during the \npolygraph. He has not met his burden of establishing that he is a suitable candidate for \naccess to classified information. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions \nor doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1: Guideline K:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:   \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:   \n \nWithdrawn \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:    \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant access to classified information. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nBraden M.

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \nOn August 9, 2019, in accordance with DOD Directive 5220.6, as amended \n(Directive), the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and Guideline \nE (Personal Conduct).1  \n \n Applicant timely answered the SOR and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. (Answer) The case was assigned to me on October 28, 2019. The \n                                                          \n1 The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) effective within the DOD on or after September 1, 2006. Since that time, the AG were amended as \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse, and it is now in effect for any adjudications on or \nafter June 8, 2017.  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n2 \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on \nNovember 12, 2019, scheduling the hearing for December 13, 2019. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. \n \nThe Government (GX) submitted four documents marked GX 1-4 and a \ndiscovery letter, which was marked as Hearing Exhibit I. There was no objection to the \ndocuments and they were entered into the record. Applicant submitted four documents, \nwhich were marked as Applicant Exhibits (AX) A-D and testified on his behalf.  \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 28 years old. He graduated from high school, has various \ncertifications, and works as a security technician. He attended some college classes on \na part-time basis. He has been employed with various companies since approximately \n2010. He is in the Army National Guard. Applicant completed his latest security \nclearance application (SCA) on January 10, 2017. (GX 1) \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana, with varying \nfrequency, from approximately 2009 to May 2018, after being granted access to \nclassified information in approximately September 2011 (1.a). The SOR further alleges \nfalsification in his 2011 security clearance application (2.a) and falsification about the \nuse of marijuana on his 2016 security clearance application (2.b) under Guideline E. \nApplicant admitted all the allegations under the guidelines but provided detailed \nexplanations. At the hearing, the Government moved to withdraw SOR allegation 2.b \nand the motion was granted. \n \nApplicant testified that he experimented with marijuana in 2009 while in high \nschool. He and a friend smoked marijuana in the custodian\u2019s lounge. He was aware that \nsmoking marijuana was illegal. (GX 3) Applicant and his friend were found by the \nprincipal and a drug test was administered. Applicant failed the drug test. (Tr. 19) When \nApplicant spoke to an army recruiter in 2011, he told him about the marijuana use and \nwas told to not worry about it. (AX A, Tr. 13) He does not recall completing a security \nclearance application in 2011. He does not recall filling out or submitting any forms that \nasked about prior drug use. (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, file) \n \nApplicant recalls that his last drug use was at his bachelor\u2019s party in May 2018. \n(AX B) However, he admitted that he smoked marijuana due to peer pressure perhaps \nonce a week before that time. He never bought the drug or grew the product. (Tr. 21) \nHe used marijuana in the fields or woods with kids living in his neighborhood.  He \nrecalls in 2016, that after he was deployed, he used marijuana with a friend who he still \nsees occasionally. He does not feel dependent on the drug. He did not test positive after \nthat use. (GX 3) He did not take drug education classes. He held a security clearance at \nthe time of his 2018 marijuana use. (GX 3) He has no future intent to use marijuana.  He \nstated that it was a weak moment on his part and bad judgement. His family is aware of \nhis illegal use of marijuana. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n3 \nApplicant completed another security clearance application in August 2016. He \nanswered \u201cNo\u201d to Section 23 - Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity Illegal Use of \nControlled substances in the last seven (7) years. (SOR 2.b) Have you ever illegally \nused a controlled substance while possessing a security clearance.? He did not list the \nmarijuana use as alleged and admitted in SOR 1.a. \n \nApplicant stated that when he was investigated he spoke to the investigator \nabout the marijuana use. He realizes that the use of marijuana would reduce his \nemployment opportunities and present hardship to his family. (Tr. 46) He did not \nintentionally try to mislead the Government. He apologizes for the situation and states \nthat since 2009, he was up-front with the Army recruiter about the 2009 marijuana use. \nHe also told an investigator about the incident in 2016. In 2018, he reached out to the \ninvestigator and told him of his use of marijuana at his bachelor party in 2018. He \nrealized that it was a selfish mistake to accept the marijuana at the party. He was \ncredible in his testimony. He has not had any drug counseling. \n \nApplicant submitted three character references from military personnel who have \nworked with him. Each attests to his polite and respectful manner, strong character and \njudgment. (AX C) Applicant has worked for the Government in a military and contracting \ncapacity and has shown great pride in his work and an ability to lead. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n\n \n \n \n \n4 \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the \nnational interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concern for this guideline is set forth in AG \u00b6 24, where it is noted \nthat the illegal use of a controlled substance, and the use of other substances that can \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose, can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness. This is because such behavior may lead to physical or psychological \nimpairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. Such use also raised questions about a \nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nHere, Applicant admitted he used marijuana with varying frequency from 2009 to \n2018. He failed a drug test in 2009, while in high school. This is sufficient evidence to \nraise AG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse, and \u00b6 25(b): testing positive for an illegal drug. \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence, as provided by Applicant\u2019s admissions, thus \nraises security concerns under Guideline H. Therefore, the burden shifts to Applicant to \nproduce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate related security concerns.  \n \nUnder Guideline H, conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \ndrug involvement and substance misuse are enumerated. The following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 26 potentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome this problem, \nand has established a pattern of abstinence, including but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing \nor avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \n\n \n \n \n \n5 \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse \nis grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s last use of marijuana, an illegal substance, took place in 2018. He \nacknowledged using marijuana with varying frequency during the period from 2009 \nthrough 2018. He also held a security clearance at the time of his use. He sometimes \nassociates with one of the persons with whom he smoked marijuana. In the life of this \nApplicant, in terms of age, maturation, and work history, sufficient time has not passed \nto deem his marijuana usage as remote. I find AG \u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) (1)-(3) do not \napply. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities, and \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole \nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \n \nHere, Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d on his 2011 (SCA) in response to a question \ninquiring whether he had illegally used any controlled substance, for example \nmarijuana, in the last seven years or while holding a security clearance. (Section 23)   \nHis reasoning was credible in that he had informed investigators and army recruiters as \nearly as 2009 and was told not to worry. However, he did continue to use marijuana, but \nI find him credible in that he did not intentionally mislead the Government when \nresponding to the questions in Section 23 on his security clearance application.  \nConsequently, these two disqualifying conditions do not apply. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6 \nAG \u00b6 17 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Potentially \napplicable in this matter is AG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has \npassed, or the behavior is so infrequent or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \nreliability, untrustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \nHere, Applicant exhibited various incidents of unreliable conduct reflecting \nquestionable judgment. These include the few instances he used marijuana between \n2009 and 2018. His failure to disclose on his 2011 SCA that he had used marijuana was \nnot intentional. His explanation was credible and I find that if he violated the security \nconcerns under the Personal Conduct Guideline, he has mitigated them with his \ncredible admissions to an Army recruiter. \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, one must evaluate security clearance eligibility \nby considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. \nConsideration shall be given to the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \nThe final determination must be an overall commonsense judgment based on careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and conducted a whole-person \nanalysis based on the record.  \n \nApplicant is a 28-year-old who serves in the U.S. Army National Guard. He has a \nson. However, he still associates with the friend who smokes marijuana. He seemed \nvery casual about his illegal use of marijuana, including while holding a clearance. His \nuse was from 2009 to 2018 with varying frequency. He stated that he does not smoke \nanymore. Applicant was apologetic about his illegal use. \n \nHowever, he did not intentionally falsify a 2011 SCA regarding his use of \nmarijuana. The reasons he gave are credible. I have no doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \ntrustworthiness, judgment, and reliability. Under these circumstances, I find Applicant \nhas not mitigated drug involvement and substance misuse, but has mitigated the \npersonal conduct security concerns. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7 \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nWITHDRAWN \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nNoreen A.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR contains 12 allegations under Guideline E (personal conduct); ten of those allegations represent job terminations. The terminations span a period from July 2 2000 to April 13, 2016. In Applicant\u2019s answer, she factually admitted SOR 1.a through 1.c, 1.f, and 1.h through 1.l, but contested the reasons for the terminations. Regarding her denial of SOR 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g, the evidence reflects that she was terminated from these three positions due to a lack of work.

In 1978, she earned a Bachelor of Science degree in business administration and operations management. She collected additional college credits in 2012.

The Department of Defense (DOD) could not make the \naffirmative findings required to grant or continue a security clearance. DOD issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated March 25, 2019, detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline E (personal conduct). The action was taken under the \nDirector of National Intelligence issued Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nestablishing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \naccess to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs).

The \nGovernment\u2019s discovery letter dated June 6, 2019, is marked as hearing exhibit (HE) 1. \nPage numbers for all exhibits are handwritten and are located at the bottom of the page \nof each exhibit unless otherwise noted. On September 13, 2019, DOHA received the \ntranscript and the record closed. \nRulings on Procedure \nApplicant objected to GE 4 because the document was dated after the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s objection was overruled. The document is a business record generated by a \nbranch of DOD charged with responsibility of collecting, storing, and distributing \ninformation regarding personnel security clearance actions. The October 2018 date on \nGE 4 represents the date the information was retrieved from the DoD database \ndescribing reported action taken against Applicant by her former employer identified in \nSOR 1.j, 1.k, and 1.l.

A chemical spill \ncaused Applicant to become ill and seek medical treatment.

She believes she was terminated in retaliation for her complaint. In an \nunsigned statement dated October 26, 2003, a former coworker agreed with her. During \nthe unemployment benefits proceedings with the state employment agency, the \nemployer indicated Applicant had not fulfilled terms of a probationary improvement plan \nand was discharged for poor work performance, but provided no details.

(Tr. 66, 79) \nCharacter Evidence \nIn addition to the job performance evaluations of two of Applicant\u2019s former \nemployers listed at SOR 1.b and 1.g, she provided favorable comments from coworkers \n7 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nduring her professional career. Those include emails from two coworkers in May 2017 \nexpressing their gratitude for working with Applicant. During the same period, another \ncoworker commented on their shared success in preparing and putting three programs \ninto operation. During the holidays in 2013 and 2010, Applicant received praise for her \nteam player attitude, professionalism, and dependability. In November 2006, while \nworking for the contractor identified in SOR 1.g (January 2006 to March 2010), \nApplicant was recognized for her contributions to the successful integration of the test \nsecurity planning. Applicant received an undated instant compensation award for \nachievement by the employer identified in SOR 1.a. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, \nshe received two letters of recommendations for airline pilot positions. (AE M at 94-109) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. These guidelines are applied together with common sense and \nthe general factors of the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. The protection of the national security is the \nparamount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel \nbeing considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15. Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide truthful and candid \nanswers during national security investigative or adjudicative processes. \nUnder AG \u00b6 16, conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, \nbut \nwhich, \nwhen \ncombined \nwith \nall \navailable \n8 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness \nto comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating \nthat the individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior,  \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources; and  \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress by a foreign entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes:  \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson\u2019s personal, professional or community standing. \nThe SOR contains 12 personal conduct allegations that occurred between July \n2000 and April 2016. Seven different employers identified in SOR 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.f, 1.h, \n1.i, and 1.l terminated Applicant from employment for specified or less than specified \nreasons. The seventh employer issued Applicant a verbal warning in March 2016 (SOR \n1.j) regarding the employer\u2019s discrimination policy, a written warning on April 12, 2016 \n(SOR 1.k) for violating the discrimination policy, then terminated her on April 13, 2016 \nfor unprofessional and threatening conduct. The pattern of terminations expose \nApplicant\u2019s conduct to AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d)(2) and 16(d)(3). AG \u00b6 16(e)(1) is removed as a \ndisqualifying condition. In all security investigations since at least 2002, Applicant has \nbeen forthright in providing full details of each termination throughout her employment \nhistory. Since 2006 she has provided consistent explanations in SCAs, e-QIPs, and \ninterviews with investigators of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).  \nApplicant was terminated from the employers identified in SOR 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g \ndue to a lack of work rather than other types of misconduct alleged in the SOR. In SOR \n1.d and 1.e, she received unemployment benefits anyway. In the case of SOR 1.g, the \ncase was mediated and settled in Applicant\u2019s favor by a federal employment agency. \nThe personnel actions taken by these three employers, which occurred over a six-year \nperiod between November 2004 and March 2010, are resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \n9 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 17, conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and  \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability.  \nRegarding the July 2000 termination (SOR 1.a), deference is given to the \ndecision of the state employment agency to deny benefits to Applicant. She failed to \nrebut the evidence presented by her former employer. Though a number of subsequent \nemployers listed in the SOR also terminated Applicant for poor work performance, none \nof them based their termination on an attendance issue. She receives some mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) because the unexcused absence was an isolated \nemployment event that occurred almost 19 years ago without similar misconduct since. \nConcerning Applicant\u2019s termination from the other listed employers however, she \nfiled and was awarded unemployment benefits because the various state agencies in \nSOR 1.b, 1.c (with documentation), 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.h, 1.i (with documentation), and 1.l \n(with documentation), found there was no misconduct connected with her job. \nSignificantly, the SOR 1.g termination was mediated and settled in Applicant\u2019s favor by \na federal employment agency even though the state agency declined benefits because \nthe termination resulted from lack of work. While the burdens of proof are different in an \nunemployment compensation case and a security clearance case, poor work \nperformance, insubordination, or violation of a discrimination policy would reasonably \nseem to be misconduct related to the job. Yet these state agencies found no or very \nlittle actionable misconduct to deny Applicant unemployment benefits. After reviewing all \nthe state agency findings (documented and undocumented), I conclude that the charges \nof poor performance, insubordination, violating an employer\u2019s discrimination policy, and \nthreatening conduct, as being unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. AG \u00b6 17(f) applies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the three specific personal conduct \nguidelines in the context of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept listed \nat AG \u00b6 2(d): \n10 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nThe record evidence indicates that Applicant was terminated from employment \non ten occasions (SOR 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.l) over a 16-year \nperiod from July 2000 to April 2016; three of those ten terminations (SOR 1.d, 1.e, 1.g) \nwere due to lack of work rather than alleged misconduct. Nonetheless, seven \nterminations clearly show a pattern of conduct that could be interpreted as poor \njudgment and unreliability. It would seem improbable that Applicant would be terminated \nfrom at least seven different employers unless she violated company policy or caused a \nproblem in the workplace. \nHowever, except for SOR 1.a, Applicant filed and was awarded unemployment \nbenefits following her seven terminations in SOR 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.h, 1.i, and her \ntermination by the same employer in SOR 1.l. The critical reason found by the state \nemployment agencies in each decision was insufficient evidence proving that \nApplicant\u2019s termination was due to misconduct connected to her job. \nApplicant has held a security clearance since 1981 with no security violations. In \nJune 2008, an SOR was issued alleging she falsified her SCA in 2006. The SOR was \nresolved before a hearing in Applicant\u2019s favor after she provided evidence \ndemonstrating there was no falsification, but rather a termination due to lack of work. \nApplicant received a security clearance in March 2010. (AE M at 71) \nFollowing Applicant\u2019s dismissal in April 2016 from employer (SOR 1.l), she was \nawarded unemployment benefits. During the course of the civil action settlement \nproceedings in January 2017, the CEO of Applicant\u2019s former employer indicated that \nafter additional investigation into the events culminating in the incident report (GE 4, \nApril 13, 2016), Applicant\u2019s conduct represented an employment disagreement and not \na security violation. \nFour months after Applicant\u2019s termination from the SOR 1.l employer, she \nresumed work with several employers as a program or project manager. She has \nreceived several compliments from coworkers in 2010, 2013, and 2017. Judging by the \ntotality of all the circumstances of this case, including the favorable performance \n11 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n_________________ \nevaluations from the employers identified in SOR 1.b and 1.g, Applicant has provided \nsufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns raised by the personal conduct \nguideline. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.l: \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn February 7, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline B (foreign \ninfluence). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on May 10, 2019, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on July 26, 2019. The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on August 20, 2019, \nscheduling the hearing for September 12, 2019. \n \n\n \n2 \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. The Government\u2019s exhibit list and table of \nfinancial allegations, as well as a Request for Administrative Notice for the Arab Republic \nof Egypt, were appended to the record. I admitted Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 into \nevidence without objection. Applicant testified, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough K, which I admitted in evidence without objection. The record was held open \npending additional documents to be submitted by Applicant. Those additional documents \nwere submitted within the appropriate time, marked collectively as AE C, and admitted \ninto evidence without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September \n28, 2019. \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s request that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout the Arab Republic of Egypt was included in the record as HE II. Applicant did not \nobject. I have taken administrative notice of the facts contained in HE II, summarized \nbelow. I have also taken administrative notice of facts about Egypt from the U.S. \nDepartment of State website. Egypt is a republic governed by an elected president and \nunicameral legislature. The United States and Egypt share a strong partnership based on \nmutual interest in Middle East peace and stability, economic opportunity, and regional \nsecurity. Promoting a stable, prosperous Egypt, where the government protects the basic \nrights of its citizens and fulfills the aspirations of the Egyptian people, will continue to be \na core objective of U.S. policy. The U.S. government provides Egypt with military training \nand equipment to support counterterrorism efforts, and significant economic assistance. \nAmerica is one of Egypt\u2019s leading trade partners. There is however a significant threat of \nterrorism and ongoing human rights problems in Egypt. Egypt has been under a \ngovernment-declared state of emergency since the 2017 terrorist attacks on Coptic \nchurches. Recently, the threat of terrorism is greatest in the Sinai Peninsula and Western \nDesert, and with limited exceptions, U.S. government employees are not authorized to \ntravel there. Terrorist attacks have also occurred in Cairo in 2018, and there was an attack \non a tourist bus in Giza in 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s father, grandmother, and parents-in-law are \nresidents and citizens of Egypt; his spouse and mother are citizens of Egypt, residing in \nthe United States; and his brother is a citizen of Egypt, living in the United Arab Emirates \n(UAE). Applicant admitted the SOR allegations, and provided comments and documents \nwith his answer to the SOR. \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old American citizen by birth. He received a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in 2007 from an Egyptian university, and a master\u2019s degree in 2012 from an \nAmerican university. He has been employed as a senior software engineer by a U.S. \ndefense contractor since February 2018, who is sponsoring him for a security clearance. \nHe previously worked for a similar U.S. defense contractor form October 2015 to February \n2018, but was promoted to a senior position to move to his current employer. Applicant \n\n \n3 \n \nmarried in December 2017 and has a one-year-old daughter, also a U.S. citizen. He has \nno foreign financial interests. Applicant has a brother who is a U.S. citizen and resident, \nand another who is an Egyptian citizen, working in construction in the UAE. \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse was born in Saudi Arabia and lived there for seven years before \nmoving to Egypt. She is an Egyptian citizen, attended school in Egypt, and became a \nlicensed medical doctor in approximately 2006. She practiced as a dermatologist and \nstudied for a master\u2019s degree, which was awarded in 2016. She met Applicant in Egypt \nin December 2016 through an arrangement with his mother and her family\u2019s friends. She \ntraveled to the United States in September 2017 to visit her sister and Applicant, and she \nand Applicant married in December 2017 in the United States. She became a U.S. \npermanent resident in January 2019, and intends to apply for U.S. citizenship as soon as \npermitted. She believes she can apply for citizenship in about three years, and is willing \nto renounce her Egyptian citizenship. She has no business, financial, or property interests \nin Egypt. In a post-hearing letter, she described her love and awe of the United States, \ncalling it the greatest of nations with great, hardworking people, and a nation of freedom, \njustice, expression of speech, liberty, and law. She is studying to take the U.S. medical \nlicensing exam to become a U.S. licensed physician and hopes to practice medicine in \nthe United States. \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother and father currently reside together in Egypt, and are both \nEgyptian citizens. His mother is a 66-year-old U.S. permanent resident who travels \nbetween Egypt and the United States to visit her family. She intends to become a U.S. \ncitizen as soon as permitted. She is a degreed civil engineer, but has worked substantially \nas a homemaker and currently cares for her spouse. Applicant\u2019s father is a civil \nengineering professor at an Egyptian university. He earned a degree from an American \nuniversity, was named the graduate student of the year, and eventually taught \nengineering at the same university when Applicant and his brother were born. He received \na prestigious American Society of Civil Engineers award for his work and was personally \nrecognized by a U.S. ambassador for his design work on a U.S. embassy compound. He \nis 69 years old and suffers from a heart condition, but intends to apply for U.S. permanent \nresident status as soon as practical. \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother is an Egyptian citizen, residing in the UAE shortly after \ngraduating from an American university in Egypt in 2007. He is a construction engineer \nfor a UAE construction company. He received a master\u2019s degree from a U.S. university \nin 2017. He is pursuing a U.S. professional engineering certification and has applied for \nU.S. permanent resident status, which is currently pending approval. He intends to \nrenounce his Egyptian citizenship once he is able to become a U.S. citizen. He and \nApplicant speak with each other about every three to six months. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s grandmother is in her late 80s and not highly educated. His parents \ncare for her in Egypt. Applicant speaks with her about twice a year. His father-in-law is a \ncivil engineer who operates his own business in Egypt, and his mother-in-law is a high \nschool graduate and homemaker in Egypt. All are citizens and residents of Egypt. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nNone of Applicant\u2019s family members have ties to a foreign military, government or \nintelligence service. Applicant maintains weekly phone or social media contact with his \nparents and tries to visit them annually. He reports all foreign travel to his facility security \nofficer and he provides a debrief when he returns. Applicant noted that his employer \ntrained him on issues to consider when traveling abroad. He owns a home in the U.S. \nvalued at about $320,000, and has about $19,000 in bank and investment accounts after \npaying a cash down payment on his home. He regularly attends religious services. Two \nof Applicant\u2019s co-workers and friends submitted letters on his behalf, attesting to his \ndevotion to family, work and friendships. Applicant is described as compassionate, a \npassionate family man, dedicated, honest, trustworthy and inspiring. Applicant was \nawarded in 2018 for the impact his work has on his company, and he was recognized as \na team innovator for his achievements in efficiency and effectiveness. He presented \nhimself at the hearing as a thoughtful, mature professional, and appeared honest and \nforthcoming in his testimony. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \n\n \n5 \n \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6:       \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened \nrisk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low standard. \n\n \n6 \n \n\u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \nmember living under a foreign government.  \n \nThere is a significant threat of terrorism and ongoing human rights problems in \nEgypt. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a potential conflict of interest and a heightened \nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion, both \ndirectly and through his spouse. The above disqualifying conditions have been raised by \nthe evidence.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which  \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \nand \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Egypt, which are essentially limited \nto his parents, grandmother, and in-laws in Egypt, and his brother working in the UAE. \nEgypt is a republic governed by an elected president and unicameral legislature. The \nUnited States and Egypt share a strong partnership based on mutual interest in Middle \nEast peace and stability, economic opportunity, and regional security. Guideline B is not \nlimited to countries hostile to the United States. The United States has a compelling \ninterest in protecting and safeguarding classified information from any person, \norganization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether \nthat person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United States. \n \n \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made with \ncaution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States \nover matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, we \nknow friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in \nthe economic, scientific, and technical fields. The nature of a nation\u2019s government, its \nrelationship with the United States, and its human rights record are relevant in assessing \nthe likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country \nhas an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon \n\n \n7 \n \nthe government, the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \n \nApplicant is a loyal American. His wife is an accomplished and educated U.S. \npermanent resident who will apply for citizenship as soon as it is available. She is also \nworking toward obtaining her license to practice medicine in the U.S. Their daughter is a \nU.S. citizen by birth. Applicant is a recognized and valued employee, promoted to a senior \nposition at a young age. He maintains close relations with his co-workers and friends, and \nregularly attends religious services. His life and all of his assets are in the United States, \nbut he retains regular contact with his parents as is typically expected of a son. His brother \nis a U.S. citizen, and his other brother is a professional engineer working in the UAE with \nwhom Applicant has limited contact. His brother however applied for U.S. permanent \nresidency and intends to become a U.S. citizen. His mother is a U.S. permanent resident \nand regularly travels between caring for her spouse in Egypt and visiting with her family \nin the United States. Applicant\u2019s father is an accomplished professor, but suffers from a \nheart condition and currently maintains his life in Egypt. His grandmother and in-laws are \nhomemakers and a business owner. Applicant has limited contact with them, but his \nspouse likely maintains regular contact with her parents as is typical of a daughter. \n \n \nI find that Applicant\u2019s ties to Egypt are outweighed by his deep and long-standing \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States. His closest family, life, home, assets, and \nprofessional career are in the United States. I find that it is unlikely he will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of the United States and the interests \nof Egypt. There is no conflict of interest, because he can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the United States. The above mitigating conditions are \napplicable. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \n\n \n8 \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under this guideline, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the foreign influence security concerns. Accordingly, I conclude he has carried \nhis burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant his \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nGregg A.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Having thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 40 years old. He has never been married and does not have any children. Since 1985, Applicant has resided with his family and grandmother in his grandmother\u2019s house. In 2004, he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering, and in 2012, he earned his master\u2019s degree in the same field. In 2015, he was hired by a defense contractor, but his employment is contingent on him obtaining a DOD security clearance.

The doctor concluded that Applicant suffers from interfering mental health conditions that could have a negative impact on his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness when handling classified information or performing sensitive tasks in the future. Applicant had been asked to participate in a psychological evaluation after reports of his questionable behavior and poor judgment in the workplace surfaced during the course of his security clearance investigation.

    "full_text": "1 \n    DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE \n  DEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS \nIn the matter of: \n) \n) \n) \nISCR Case No. 18-02384 \n) \nApplicant for Security Clearance \n) \nAppearances \nFor Government: Rhett Petcher, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant:                    , Personal Representative \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nBENSON, Pamela C., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant\u2019s most recent psychological evaluation indicated that his present \nmental status negatively impacts his judgment and trustworthiness. He has a history of \ninappropriate personal conduct in the workplace, and an inability to follow rules, \ndeadlines, policies, and procedures. He failed to mitigate psychological conditions, \npersonal conduct, and handling protected information security concerns. National \nsecurity eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n Statement of the Case \nOn August 5, 2015, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA). \nOn October 3, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline I (Psychological Conditions), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), \nand Guideline K (Handling Protected Information). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nthe Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.    \n\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR on December 8, 2019. He denied all of the \nSOR allegations, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. On February \n4, 2020, the case was assigned to me. On February 7, 2020, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for \nFebruary 26, 2020.  \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1-7, \nwhich I admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant stated that he was uncertain \nif GE 5 included all of the e-mail correspondence he had with his former employer. I \ngranted Applicant three weeks (March 18, 2020), in which I would hold the record open \nto submit any relevant documents in mitigation of his case. During the hearing, \nApplicant testified, his father testified and acted as a personal representative for \nApplicant, and no documents were submitted for my consideration. On March 17, 2020, \nhe submitted six documents labeled as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-F, which I admitted \ninto evidence without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 6, \n2020, and the record closed on March 18, 2020. (Tr. 20-21) \nProcedural Rulings \nApplicant\u2019s submission of documents on March 17, 2020, included a cover letter \nin which Applicant asked that I make a formal request to the Department of Justice \nand/or the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to have an unredacted copy of \nApplicant\u2019s 2015 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigative report provided \nto me for consideration in his case. His request is denied since it is not within my \nauthority or jurisdiction to order other U.S. Government agencies to provide me with \nunredacted copies of their investigative reports. The reports are redacted to delete or \nmask information that has been deemed as privileged, confidential, or to protect \nsensitive information being released to the general public. Therefore, I cannot, and will \nnot, obstruct this essential security measure.  \nApplicant also requested that I contact specific people listed in his documents \nwho could verify his testimony and credibility. It is important to note that applicants are \npermitted to have witnesses at their hearing to verify their testimony and credibility. In \nthis case, Applicant\u2019s father testified. In all fairness to the opposing party, these \nwitnesses are then subject to cross examination by Department Counsel. Applicant \nchose not to call these witnesses at his hearing. Applicant also could have requested \nthat these individuals provide affidavits or character reference letters, which he could \nthen submit for my consideration by the close of the record. He chose not to do so. It is \nnot the DOHA judge\u2019s responsibility to contact these individuals to obtain information \npertinent to Applicant\u2019s case since all applicants bear the burden of mitigation. \nApplicant\u2019s second request is denied. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nHaving thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, I make the following \nfindings of fact: Applicant is 40 years old. He has never been married and does not \nhave any children. Since 1985, Applicant has resided with his family and grandmother in \nhis grandmother\u2019s house. In 2004, he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical \nengineering, and in 2012, he earned his master\u2019s degree in the same field. In 2015, he \nwas hired by a defense contractor, but his employment is contingent on him obtaining a \nDOD security clearance. (GE 1, GE 4) \n \nSOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b allege that Applicant participated in a \npsychological evaluation in March 2018 in which he was diagnosed as exhibiting signs \nof Paranoid Personality Disorder, Autism Spectrum Disorder, and Unspecified Anxiety \nDisorder. The doctor concluded that Applicant suffers from interfering mental health \nconditions that could have a negative impact on his judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness when handling classified information or performing sensitive tasks in the \nfuture. Applicant had been asked to participate in a psychological evaluation after \nreports of his questionable behavior and poor judgment in the workplace surfaced \nduring the course of his security clearance investigation. Applicant denied both SOR \nallegations, and testified that the doctor\u2019s diagnosis and conclusion were in error due, in \npart, to lack of information. (Tr. 65, GE 4; SOR Response \u201cB\u201d) \n \nThe doctor, a licensed psychologist, used Applicant\u2019s background information \nprovided by the DOD CAF, and administered the Personality Assessment Inventory \nduring the psychological evaluation. He also conducted a clinical interview and \npersonally observed Applicant. Applicant reported that he was wrongfully terminated by \na DOD government employer in 2011 because he had witnessed and reported \nnefarious activities in the workplace, to include inappropriate handling of classified \ninformation, co-worker connections to the Mexican drug cartel, deliberate espionage, \nand the framing of an innocent employee supposedly involved in child pornography. \nAfter his job termination, he claimed the defense contractor\u2019s employees then made him \nthe subject of their surveillance and the eventual victim of arson in 2012. These acts \nwere committed against Applicant in retaliation for his disclosure of these events to the \nFBI and the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI). The doctor concluded \nthat Applicant\u2019s paranoid personality disorder involved a global mistrust and suspicion of \nothers\u2019 motives. The events Applicant described are certainly possible events, but in the \ncontext of the psychological evaluation, those events were likely improbable. He \nrecommended Applicant participate in psychiatric treatment. As of the date of the \nhearing, Applicant had not received any treatment for his present mental status. (Tr. 67- \n76, 123-124; GE 4; AE E; SOR response \u201cB, D-G\u201d) \n \nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR stated that the doctor\u2019s diagnosis was biased \nand skewed. Applicant\u2019s grandmother had passed away less than six months prior to \nthe date of his psychological evaluation, and he had asked the doctor if his grief would \nadversely affect the test results. The doctor stated it would not, but Applicant does not \nagree with that assessment. Applicant had inquired whether the doctor had received \n\n \n4 \n \n \nverification and validation from the FBI and AFOSI regarding his experiences at his \nformer workplace and the following repercussions, to which the doctor replied he had. \nDuring the course of the evaluation, Applicant revealed that he had an extensive \npersonal engineering library and that he was sexually inactive, which he asserted was \ninformation that was inappropriately considered by the doctor. Overall, he felt that the \ndoctor\u2019s diagnosis of him exhibiting signs of Paranoid Personality Disorder, Autism \nSpectrum Disorder, and Unspecified Anxiety Disorder is incomplete, biased, \nunprofessional, as well as personally insulting. (Tr. 30-31, SOR response \u201cB, F\u201d) \n \nApplicant requested the FBI conduct a polygraph examination on him to validate \nhis reported incidents and to show the government that he is not a threat to the U.S., \nbut the FBI denied that request. He also requested through the Freedom of Information \nAct, and by a direct request to the FBI, that portions of his 2015 investigative report from \nthe OPM be unredacted, which was also denied. Applicant claimed the FBI could not \nprovide the redacted portions of his investigative records due to a current and \naggressively ongoing criminal investigation to apprehend the criminals he had identified \nfrom his former place of employment. (Tr. 138-139; AE cover letter; AE E; SOR \nresponse \u201cB, D, E\u201d) \n \nIn June 2011, Applicant was terminated from a government employer located on \na military installation. His job termination was related to his personal conduct and \ninability to follow policies and procedures. (SOR \u00b6 2.b) The concerns included: multiple \nlate arrivals to work and work meetings; demonstrating a lack of respect to his co-\nworkers; attempting to gain unauthorized entry to the Sensitive Compartmented \nInformation Facility (SCIF); attempting to query an unknown foreign national, who he \nfound via an online software forum, for assistance with his work; and for bringing a \nprohibited USB drive into the SCIF and failing to properly report the security violation. \nBased on the foregoing security-related incidents, Applicant\u2019s access to classified \ninformation was suspended in April 2011. This allegation was also cross-referenced as \nSOR \u00b6 3.a under Guideline K (Handling Protected Information). (GE 6; SOR response \n\u201cB, D-G\u201d) \n \nApplicant denied this allegation in his response to the SOR. He claimed that he \nhad unreliable transportation due to mechanical issues with his car, which caused him \nto be late. He remedied this situation by notifying his employer of the problem, and \nhaving his car repaired. He has \u201calways shown respect\u201d to all of his co-workers and \nsupervisors. He admitted he had an unpleasant incident with a former co-worker, but \nonly after he learned that he missed a meeting that was not previously communicated to \nhim. He apologized to her for being abrupt, and she accepted his apology. Applicant \nacknowledged an attempted entry into the SCIF, but this was only due to the fact that \nthe door was not labeled TOP SECRET SCIF. As to the foreign national allegation, \nApplicant had been told by a supervisor that employees were permitted to post generic \nquestions on the internet to gain information about work-related material. When \nApplicant had asked if he could contact a foreign national to obtain information, he was \nimmediately told not to do so. Applicant stated that he followed proper procedures by \nfirst asking if he could contact the foreign national, and then immediately disregarding \n\n \n5 \n \n \nmaking contact once he was told to do so. His carrying a prohibited device into a SCIF \nwas unintentional. He had previously placed a USB drive in his wallet, and it accidently \nfell out after he opened his wallet to pay for a snack in the SCIF area. He claimed to \nhave followed proper security protocols by handing over the USB drive to the \nappropriate individual to safeguard the device. The USB was reviewed by the security \noffice and no classified files were found on it. Applicant stated this was an inadvertent \nmistake that will never be repeated. (Tr. 95-104, 106-122, 127, 130-137; GE 1, GE 2, \nGE 3; AE C; SOR response \u201cB, D-G\u201d) \n \nIn October 2014, Applicant was terminated from a different employer due to his \ninability to follow project guidelines, meet requirements to produce tangible work results \nwithin reasonable deadlines, and his inability to follow clear instructions and stay on \ntask. (SOR \u00b6 2.a) Applicant denied this allegation and blamed his former employer for \ninstituting unreasonable timelines for the completion of assigned projects. In addition, \nhis former employer failed to provide the proper equipment and software he needed to \ncomplete the task. Applicant raised awareness in the workplace that the employer\u2019s \nsoftware could cause human injuries and electrical fires. Shortly thereafter, he asserted \nhe was wrongly terminated by this employer. Applicant claimed that the fact that he was \nawarded unemployment benefits from the state is evidence that his former employer \nwas found to be dishonest in their business and the state is currently investigating his \nformer employer for their corrupt actions. (Tr. 88-94, 140-143; GE 1; SOR response \u201cB \nand H\u201d) After his job termination in October 2014, Applicant sent e-mail communications \nto his former employer. The title of one particular e-mail; \u201cI am still enjoying the money \nfrom (employer) having to pay unemployment.\u201d He told his former boss that he was the \n\u201cworst god-forsaken and despicable employer\u201d that he had ever encountered. Applicant \nthreatened to reveal adverse information to their business client. He also requested that \nhis former boss stop harassing a co-worker who was involved in a romantic relationship \nwith a foreign national. Applicant wholly supported the co-worker\u2019s position that \u201call \nAmerican women are despicable lying females who are only capable of falsely accusing \nmen of RAPE and SEXUAL ASSAULT.\u201d He identified a female co-worker that fit this \ndescription, and told his former boss that maybe she would accuse him of such a crime. \n(Tr. 86, 88-92, 140-148; GE 5; AE B; SOR response \u201cB and H\u201d) \n \nAn attorney representing the former employer sent Applicant a letter dated June \n2, 2015, notifying him to immediately cease and desist from any further \ncommunications. In response to Applicant\u2019s threat to contact the business client, it was \nnoted that he had previously signed a confidentiality agreement, a copy of which was \nattached to the letter. If Applicant violated this agreement, the former employer would \nconsider pursuing legal remedies against him. Applicant sent an e-mail to his former \nboss the next day. He also contacted an attorney to determine whether he could contact \nthe business client, whether his former employer would sue him, and if so, would his \nformer employer be able to stop his unemployment benefits. Applicant claimed that this \nformer employer \u201cblacklisted\u201d him by providing negative reviews to potential employers \ninquiring about his possible employment. (Tr. 149-150; GE 5; AE B, AE D, AE F; SOR \nresponse \u201cB and H\u201d) \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant had been previously employed by a government contractor and was \nlaid off in approximately 2008. Applicant admitted in an e-mail that he made serious \nmistakes during his employment. He contacted his former supervisor after he suspected \nthat he had been \u201cblacklisted\u201d due to his inability to find subsequent employment. He \nalso suspected that his former employer was embezzling money from one of their \ncustomers. Applicant\u2019s SOR does not allege this information. Applicant testified that the \nofficial reason he was let go from this employer was because the employer\u2019s defense \nproject was terminated by Congress. Applicant claims the unofficial reason he was let \ngo by his employer was for him making terrorist threats. (Tr. 153-159; GE 2; AE A) In \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five \ncircumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  \n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines \nis applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s father was both a personal representative and a witness at the \nhearing. He verified several unusual events, to include the home survelliance that \noccurred from August 2011 to April 7, 2012, the date of the suspicious house fire that he \nclaimed was still under investigation by the fire department for arson. No one was able \nto make any contact with the individuals who participated in the surveillance, or obtain \nthe license plate numbers from the blackened vehicles used in that endeavor. He \nparticipated in the meetings with the FBI and AFOSI. Applicant also provided three \ncharacter reference letters. It appears that all four individuals have worked with him in \nsome capacity, and all characterized Applicant as a trusted, gifted, and dedicated \nindividual. None of these individuals mentioned that they were aware of the security \nconcerns alleged in his SOR.  (TR. 25-64, 76-85; SOR response \u201cC and I\u201d) \n  \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n\n \n7 \n \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 an \u201capplicant is responsible \nfor presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \n \n \nAG \u00b6 27 expresses the security concern for psychological conditions: \n \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \n\n \n8 \n \n \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling.  \n \n \nThe medical information and report in evidence raised the following \nPsychological Conditions Disqualifying Condition under AG \u00b6 28:  \n \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness. \n \n \nThe SOR alleges psychological conditions security concerns based on Applicant \nexhibiting signs of Paranoid Personality Disorder, Autism Spectrum Disorder, and \nUnspecified Anxiety Disorder, after the completion of a psychological examination. The \nqualified licensed psychologist concluded that Applicant suffers from interfering mental \nhealth conditions that could have a negative impact on his judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness when handling classified information or performing sensitive tasks in the \nfuture.  \n \n \nI considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29: \n \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional; \n \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer has indications of \nemotional instability; and \n \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \n \n \nApplicant has not received professional treatment or prescribed medications for \nhis diagnosed psychological issues and interpersonal style. A qualified mental health \nprofessional determined that Applicant\u2019s condition was not fully under control and is \nlikely to continue, which casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. None of the mitigating conditions fully apply.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable:  \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of \nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or other \ngovernment protected information: \n \n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the \nworkplace; \n \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources. \n \n \nApplicant was terminated from employment in October 2014 for his inability to \nfollow project guidelines, meet requirements to produce tangible work results within \nreasonable deadlines, and his inability to follow clear instructions and stay on task. \n(SOR \u00b6 2.a) He was terminated from employment in June 2011 for his personal conduct \nand inability to follow policies and procedures. (SOR \u00b6 2.b) The record establishes AG \u00b6 \n16(d). Additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions is \nrequired.  \n \n \nSix personal conduct mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially \napplicable in this case: \n\n \n10 \n \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply to Applicant\u2019s history of unreliable and \ninappropriate behavior at the workplace. His pattern of rule violations, although \ninnocently committed, were serious and will most likely recur. As enumerated under \nGuideline I, his recent psychological evaluation showed that Applicant is unlikely to be \nable to change his behavior that contributed to his untrustworthy, unreliable, or other \ninappropriate behavior. Personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \n \nHandling Protected Information \n \n \nAG \u00b6 33 articulates the security concern for handling protected information:  \n \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information-which includes classified and other \nsensitive government information, and proprietary information-raises doubt \nabout an individual's trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness \nand ability to safeguard such information, and is a serious security \nconcern. \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 34 lists a condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or \nsensitive information. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.a cross-alleges the same conduct described in the personal conduct \nsection under SOR \u00b6 2.b. Specifically, Applicant\u2019s attempt to gain unauthorized entry to \nthe Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF); his attempt to query an \nunknown foreign national, who he found via an online software forum, for assistance \nwith his sensitive work; and for bringing a prohibited USB drive into the SCIF and failing \nto properly report the security violation establishes AG \u00b6 34(g). \n \nAG \u00b6 35 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \nsecurity responsibilities; \n \n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training or \nunclear instructions; and \n \n(d) the violation was inadvertent, it was promptly reported, there is no \nevidence of compromise, and it does not suggest a pattern. \n \n \nThe mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 35 are not applicable since Applicant has a \npattern of security infractions, and in the context of the psychological evaluation, these \ntype of infractions are likely to recur. Handling protected information security concerns \nare not mitigated. \n \n \n \n \n \n  Whole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n\n \n12 \n \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 40 years old. He has been terminated by two employers for a \npattern of rule violations. He is adamant that both terminations were wrongful. Applicant \nhas shown an unusual history of mistrust and harassment by his former employers. I \nfound Applicant to be intelligent and candid during the hearing. Unfortunately, even with \nthe support of his father\u2019s testimony, the information provided about his work history and \nthe reported retaliation efforts, to include the possible murder of Applicant and his family \nmembers by intentionally setting their house on fire, appear to me to be irrational.  \n \n \nThe licensed psychologist concluded that Applicant\u2019s paranoid personality \ndisorder involved a global mistrust and suspicion of others\u2019 motives, which is apparent \nfrom the evidence presented in this case. There is no evidence of any criminal \ninvestigation of his former co-workers by the FBI or AFOSI. There is no evidence that \nhis former employer was involved in the surveillance or deliberately set Applicant\u2019s \nresidence on fire. There is no evidence of a continuing arson investigation by the fire \ndepartment. The doctor acknowledged that the events Applicant described were \ncertainly possible events, but in the context of the psychological evaluation, those \nevents were likely improbable. Overall, Applicant\u2019s present mental state may impair his \njudgment, stability, and reliability. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of \nshowing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline I:  \n \n      AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \n      Against Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n      AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \n \n      Against Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline K:  \n \n      AGAINST APPLICANT \n\n \n13 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n       \n      Against Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n                \n \n \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

National security eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nHistory of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on March 1, 2017. On \nNovember 9, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guidelines H (Drug Abuse and Substance \nMisuse) and E (Personal Conduct). Applicant answered the SOR on January 7, 2019, \nand requested a hearing before an administrative judge (Answer). The case was assigned \nto me on January 30, 2019. Due to Applicant\u2019s counsel\u2019s scheduling conflicts, the hearing \ncould not be scheduled as planned in May 2019. The case was re-assigned to me on \nOctober 1, 2019. On October 22, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for November 20, 2019.  \n \nAt the hearing, Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 and Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \nand B were admitted without objection, and Applicant testified. The record was held open \nuntil December 2, 2019, but Applicant did not submit additional documentation. I received \nthe complete transcript (Tr.) on December 4, 2019, and closed the record. \n \n \n\n \n2 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is almost 34, single, and has no children. He was the valedictorian of his \nhigh school class. In 2008, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in philosophy and aerospace \nengineering. In 2010, he received a master\u2019s degree in aerospace engineering. Applicant \nreceived prestigious grants to attend both universities, which are among the best in the \nUnited States. Since December 2015, he has worked as a research engineer for a \ndefense contractor at a research facility. He applied for his first security clearance in \nMarch 2017. (GE 1; Tr. 14-23) \n \n \nApplicant admitted, with explanation, all of the SOR allegations, including: using \nand purchasing 3,4-methylenedioxy-mehtaphetamine (MDMA) between January and \nAugust 2017; selling one MDMA pill in May 2017; and using marijuana in 2011, 2012, and \n2016. He also admitted to falsifying his March 2017 SCA and making false statements \nduring his October 2017 personal subject interview (PSI). \n \n \nOn March 1, 2017, Applicant submitted his SCA, and he disclosed no involvement \nwith illegal drugs. When he completed the SCA, he understood that it was important to \ntell the truth. He did not disclose his drug use because he was concerned that any \ndisclosure of drug use would prevent him from obtaining government employment, in \nparticular because he is a minority. He also felt pressure to complete the SCA quickly. \n(Answer; GE 1 at 39-40; Tr. 26-28, 45-48, 51-52) \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in October 2017, \nNovember 2017, and May 2018. During his first PSI on October 20, 2017, Applicant \naffirmatively denied any drug use. In doing so, he failed again to disclose his illegal drug \ninvolvement, and he also provided false information to the investigator. (GE 1 at 39-40; \nGE 2 at 2-3, 9) \n \n \nApplicant testified that he did not appreciate or understand the seriousness of the \nsecurity clearance process until his initial interview in October 2017. He explained that \nafter the initial interview, he conducted research regarding lying in a SCA and during \ngovernment interviews. He then realized that drug use and lying in SCAs is a \u201cbig deal.\u201d \n(Tr. 28-31) \n \n \nOn November 15, 2017, Applicant called the investigator and requested that the \ninvestigator not contact his former girlfriend. She was a listed contact in his SCA, and \nthey had recently ended their relationship. Applicant was concerned about what she \nwould say about him and how it could hurt his chances of obtaining a security clearance. \nThe investigator told Applicant that because his girlfriend was listed as a source in his \nSCA, interviewing her was not optional. (GE 2 at 11-12, Tr. 53-57, 76) \n \n \nTwo days after his request to the investigator, Applicant called the investigator and \nconfessed to using drugs, failing to disclose his drug use, and asked for a subsequent \ninterview. Several days later, on November 21, 2017, Applicant was re-interviewed by the \ninvestigator. He disclosed that he used marijuana once in 2011 and once in 2012. He \nalso consumed edible marijuana in the spring of 2016. All of his marijuana use occurred \n\n \n3 \n \nat parties. He also disclosed that in early 2017, he purchased MDMA pills from a website \nbecause he was interested in neuroscience and the affect MDMA has on the brain. He \nused MDMA 5 to 10 times, and sold an MDMA pill one time at a party in May 2017. \nApplicant told the investigator that his drug use was not habitual or detrimental to his life, \nand that he did not think he had to disclose it. During a subsequent PSI in May 2018, \nApplicant disclosed that he used MDMA from early 2017 until the summer of 2017. (GE \n2 at 13-14, 17-18; Tr. 33-35, 53-57, 68) \n \n \nIn October 2018, Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories regarding his drug \nuse. He certified the accuracy (with one minor change) of all three of his PSIs. He also \ncompleted a worksheet, in which he claimed that he used marijuana only one time, and \naffirmed that he used MDMA 5 to 10 times in 2017. (GE 2 at 4; Tr. 58) \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant initially acknowledged that he used marijuana only one \ntime in 2012, and that he used MDMA only 3 to 4 times in 2017. Additionally, for the first \ntime, he claimed that all of his MDMA use occurred after he completed his SCA in March \n2017, and therefore, he did not fail to disclose his MDMA use in his SCA. Upon further \nquestioning, he admitted purchasing 10 MDMA pills, using MDMA 4 times with his former \ngirlfriend and once by himself at a party, and using marijuana a total of three times. \nApplicant claimed the discrepancy regarding his marijuana use was due to forgetfulness \nand was unintentional. He asserted that he decided to experiment with MDMA due to his \neducational background in neuroscience and philosophy. (Tr. 32-36, 49-51, 58, 66) \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant maintained that he continued to use MDMA after he \ncompleted his SCA, because he wanted to try it, and \u201cit was gone from his mind\u201d that drug \nuse was inconsistent with holding a security clearance. However, he also acknowledged \nthat at the same time he was concerned that if his employer learned he had used drugs \nhis employment would be in jeopardy. As of the hearing, Applicant had not reported his \n2016 marijuana use and 2017 MDMA use to his FSO or supervisor, because he was \nafraid it would negatively impact his ability to get a clearance, maintain his employment, \nand damage his reputation. Applicant has not been subjected to any urinalyses through \nhis current employment, but his employer does have a policy prohibiting the use of illegal \ndrugs. (Tr. 44, 66-69, 76) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor, who submitted a letter of recommendation, has known \nApplicant for four years in a professional capacity. His letter indicated he is aware that \nApplicant used drugs approximately when he was in his early teens, but he is unaware \nthat Applicant used drugs since he has known him. Applicant\u2019s supervisor recommended \nhim for a clearance. Additionally, Applicant submitted a letter of recommendation from a \nfriend. Both letters of recommendation described Applicant as responsible, reliable, and \ntrustworthy. (AE A; AE B; Tr. 23, 69) \n \n \nApplicant testified that he has not used MDMA since the summer of 2017, because \nhis curiosity was satisfied, and he does not intend to use illegal drugs in the future. He \nhas friends that continue to use marijuana, but he avoids being around them when they \nuse drugs. While in college, Applicant volunteered as a tutor. Applicant is currently \napplying to become an Air Force Reserve Officer. (GE 2 at 15, 18; Tr. 38, 41-43)  \n\n \n4 \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Abuse and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted \nin this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence established the following \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \n \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \n \ndrug paraphernalia. \n \nThe burden shifted to Appellant to prove mitigation of the resulting security \nconcerns. AG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAppellant\u2019s decision to purchase, use, and sell illegal drugs after he completed his \nSCA cannot be considered a minor lapse in judgment, but rather a pattern of behavior \nthat reflects his unwillingness to follow rules and regulations. Security clearance decisions \nare not limited to conduct during duty hours. Off-duty conduct, especially where it reflects \npoor judgment, provides a rational basis for the government to question an appellant\u2019s \nsecurity worthiness. (See, e.g., Cole v. Young, 351 U.S. 536, 550 n.13 (1956); Croft v. \nDepartment of Air Force, 40 M.S.P.R. 320, 321 n.1 (1989)). Applicant\u2019s behavior showed \na disregard for the law, regulations, and the fiduciary relationship he voluntarily entered \ninto with the government.  \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana once in 2011, 2012, and in 2016. He purchased 10 pills \nof MDMA in early 2017 and sold one MDMA pill in May 2017. He used MDMA at least \nfive times in 2017. He had an opportunity to make changes to the statements, he made \na change, and then reaffirmed the information he provided in the statements. Applicant\u2019s \nhearing testimony regarding his history of drug involvement was inconsistent with the \nstatements he made to the government investigator. His characterization of his use \nthroughout the investigative process minimized his drug involvement and reduced his \ncredibility.   \n \n \nApplicant did not disclose his drug involvement to the government until he became \nconcerned that his former girlfriend would disclose his involvement with drugs during her \ngovernment interview. He did not report his 2016 marijuana use or his 2017 MDMA \ninvolvement to his employer or security officer. He acknowledged that his employer has \na policy against illegal drug use, and he was concerned that if his employer knew of his \ndrug use it would affect his employment and reputation.  \n \nApplicant continues to associate with individuals who use drugs. All of his drug \ninvolvement occurred after he had completed a master\u2019s degree in 2010, and the majority \nof his drug involvement occurred while he was working for his current employer and in his \n30s. Therefore, Applicant\u2019s assertions that he has stopped using illegal drugs were \ninsufficient to overcome the concerns with respect to his past drug involvement, especially \nsince he was not forthcoming about it throughout the security clearance process. He failed \nto establish mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(c). \n \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n\n \n7 \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \nApplicant\u2019s false statements regarding his drug involvement in his March 2017 \nSCA and during his October 2017 PSI, buttressed by the documentary evidence, \nestablished the following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical of mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative. \nAG \u00b6 17 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and be mitigating. \nTwo are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and  \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nApplicant failed to disclose his history of drug involvement in his March 2017 SCA \nand during his October 2017 PSI. He failed to avail himself of numerous opportunities to \ncorrect his SCA omission.   \n  \nApplicant made deliberate choices to keep the government and his employer in \nthe dark regarding his behavior, raising the concern that he is unreliable and \nuntrustworthy and calling into question his judgment and willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. The totality of the evidence demonstrates that Applicant disclosed his \n\n \n8 \n \ndrug involvement because he was concerned that the government or his employer would \nlearn of his conduct from an independent source. Therefore, his disclosure does not rise \nto the level of a prompt or good-faith effort to correct his earlier falsifications.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s statements and testimony regarding his drug involvement are \ninconsistent and lack credibility. His assertion at the hearing, for the first time, that he only \nused MDMA after he completed the March 2017 SCA, demonstrates that he continues to \nbe untruthful with the government. This concern has not been mitigated by the passage \nof time. He failed to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(c). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines E and H in my \nwhole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s favorable character evidence, \nincluding his letters of recommendation. \n \n \nApplicant chose to use, purchase, and sell illegal drugs while working for his \ncurrent employer. Much of his involvement occurred just prior to applying for security \nclearance or within months of submitting his March 2017 SCA. All of this behavior \noccurred when he was in his early 30s, after he received degrees from two very prominent \nU.S. universities. There has not been a sufficient passage of time to overcome the \nconcerns with his drug involvement and falsifications. He did not initially disclose his drug \ninvolvement until he became concerned that the government would learn of his behavior \nfrom an independent source. Additionally, his hearing testimony was inconsistent and not \ncredible, indicating a continued lack of truthfulness. As of the date of the hearing, his \ncurrent supervisor and employer are not aware of his drug involvement, which primarily \noccurred while he has been in his current position. \n \n\n \n9 \n \nI conclude Applicant has not met his burden of proof and persuasion. He did not \nmitigate the drug involvement and personal conduct security concerns or establish his \neligibility for a security clearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of \nthe United States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n__________________________ \nCAROLINE E. HEINTZELMAN \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

Corrales, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n02/06/2020 \nDecision \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his late income tax filings, \nhis more than $50,000 in past-due taxes and other debts, his termination for cause from \nemployment with the Department of Defense (DOD) in 2014, and his lack of complete \ncandor on December 2013 and June 2017 security clearance applications (SCAs). \nEligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 29, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations, and Guideline E, personal conduct. The SOR \nexplained why the DOD CAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the \naction under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); \nand the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \n\n2 \n \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn May 11, 2019, Applicant responded to the Guideline F allegations and to the \nGuideline E allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.g, and he requested a decision based on the \nwritten record in lieu of a hearing. His response was incomplete for his failure to respond to \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b through 2.f. On August 22, 2019, Applicant submitted a supplemental \nresponse in which he answered all the allegations and again requested a decision on the \nwritten record. On October 31, 2019, the Government submitted a File of Relevant Material \n(FORM), including documents identified as Items 1 through 13. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant on November \n1, 2019, and instructed him that any response was due within 30 days of receipt. Applicant \nreceived the FORM on November 13, 2019. No response was received by the December \n13, 2019 deadline. On January 15, 2020, the case was assigned to me to determine \nwhether it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for Applicant. I received the case file on January 21, 2020. Items 1 \nthrough 13 included in the FORM are admitted into the record as exhibits for the \nGovernment. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant failed to timely file federal income \ntax returns for tax years 2010 through 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); owes $18,240 in delinquent \nfederal income taxes for tax years 2010 through 2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); failed to file his state \nincome tax returns for tax years 2015 through 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); owes $7,785 on a state \nincome tax lien filed against him in 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); owes judgment debts filed against \nhim in 2016 for $4,944 (SOR \u00b6 1.e) and in 2017 for $3,954 (SOR \u00b6 1.f); and owes charged- \noff or collection debts on seven other accounts totaling $28,138 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g-1.m). Under \nGuideline E, Applicant allegedly was terminated from federal employment in September \n2014 following an investigation for time-and-attendance abuse from January 2012 through \nat least January 2013 (SOR \u00b6 2.a); was terminated from a defense-contractor job in \napproximately August 2015 for poor performance (SOR \u00b6 2.b); falsified material facts on a \nDecember 17, 2013 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (hereafter \nSCA) by deliberately failing to disclose that he had failed to timely file federal income tax \nreturns for tax years 2010 through 2012 and owed delinquent income taxes (SOR \u00b6 2.c); \nand falsified material facts on a June 23, 2017 SCA by not disclosing his terminations from \nfederal employment (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d and 2.e) and his federal-contractor employment (SOR \u00b6 \n1.f) and by denying whether, in the last seven years, he had failed to file or pay federal, \nstate, or other taxes when required by law or ordinance (SOR \u00b6 2.g). (Item 1.) \n \n \nWhen Applicant answered the SOR allegations, he admitted that he failed to timely \nfile federal and state income tax returns for the years alleged but added that all his federal \ntax returns are filed. He admitted owing the federal and state income tax delinquencies, \nexplaining that he plans to establish payment arrangements for his federal taxes once he is \ngainfully employed. He admitted owing the judgment debts, but indicated that he had \nreduced the balance of the judgment in SOR \u00b6 1.e to $1,500. He admitted defaulting on the \n\n3 \n \nother accounts in the SOR except for the $8,041 allegedly owed the Defense Finance and \nAccounting Service (DFAS) (SOR \u00b6 1.h). Applicant admitted the Guideline E allegations, \nbut indicated that he was unjustly terminated from his federal employment and had filed an \nappeal \u201cto fight allegations\u201d of being absent without leave and of conduct unbecoming a \nfederal employee; that his poor performance with a defense contractor was due to poor \ntraining; and that his nondisclosure of his failure to file timely tax returns on his December \n2013 SCA \u201cwas an oversight.\u201d Applicant admitted without comment SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.e and 2.f, \nwhich respectively allege falsification of his June 2017 SCA for failing to disclose that he \nhad been fired from his federal and defense-contractor employments. (Items 2-3.) \nRegarding his negative response on his June 2017 SCA to the tax filing or tax payment \ninquiry, Applicant\u2019s initial response was \u201cI admit. However, done by accident without intent.\u201d \n(Item 2.) In his supplemental response, Applicant simply answered, \u201cI admit.\u201d (Item 3.) After \nconsidering the FORM, I make the following findings of fact: \n \nApplicant is 52 years old and unmarried. There is no evidence in the record \nindicating that he is currently employed. He seeks a security clearance so that he can work \nas a \u201cproprietary systems specialist\u201d for a defense contractor, who continues to sponsor \nhim for a security clearance despite the passage of more than two years since he \nsubmitted his SCA in June 2017. (Item 4.) \n \nApplicant has taken some college classes but has yet to earn a college degree. \n(Items 4-6.) He paid for his college classes in part with a federal student loan obtained for \n$17,560 in January 2003. (Items 11-13.) \n \nWhile working as a help-desk agent for a federal contactor, Applicant completed an \nSCA on March 12, 2009. He reported financial delinquencies on three consumer credit \naccounts totaling $1,769 and a $14,000 tax debt to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). He \nindicated that he had arrangements in place to repay his smallest debt of $187 and his IRS \ndebt, and that he would establish repayment plans for his other credit-card delinquencies. \nHe indicated on his SCA that another department of the U.S. government had granted him \na confidential clearance in August 2007 (Item 6), which he now believes was a grant of \neligibility for a public trust position. (Item 7.)  \n \nIn May 2010, Applicant resigned from his employment with a federal contractor to \nwork as a civilian information technology asset manager for the DOD in June 2010. (Items \n4- 6.) In 2013, Applicant was investigated for claiming 200 work hours on his time sheets \nbetween January 2012 and January 2013 that could not be accounted for. In approximately \nMay 2014, he was placed on administrative leave from his position with the DOD, and in \nSeptember 2014, he was involuntarily terminated for being absent without leave and for \nconduct not becoming a federal employee (SOR \u00b6 2.a). Applicant unsuccessfully appealed \nhis termination (Item 7), and in April 2015, the DFAS sought to recoup $8,017 in \nunspecified overpayments, most likely wages to which he was not entitled. As of June \n2017, Applicant owed a collection balance of $8,041 to DFAS (SOR \u00b6 1.h). (Item 13.) \nApplicant denies any wrongdoing with regard to his time and attendance and disputes the \nvalidity of the debt. (Items 2-3, 7.) \n \n\n4 \n \n \nOn December 17, 2013, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of an \nSCA on which he responded negatively to the following inquiry: \u201cIn the past seven (7) \nyears have you failed to file or pay Federal, state, or other taxes when required by law or \nordinance?\u201d (SOR \u00b6 2.c). (Item 5.) Available account transcripts from the IRS show that he \nfiled his federal income tax return for tax year 2010 in December 2011, after the IRS \ninquired about his non-filing in November 2011. He was assessed a penalty of $251 in \nFebruary 2012 for late filing, and, in March 2013, the IRS issued a notice of intent to levy \nfor nonpayment of taxes owed. IRS records also show that he had not yet filed his federal \nincome tax returns for tax years 2011 and 2012 as of his December 2013 SCA. Applicant \nwas apparently granted a DOD top secret clearance in March 2014. (Items 4, 7.)  \n \n \n After he was fired from his federal employment in September 2014, Applicant was \nunemployed through May 2015. In June 2015, he began working as a service-desk analyst \nwith a defense contractor. (Item 4.) In August 2015, he was involuntarily terminated from \nthat job for unsatisfactory performance. (Item 7.) \n \n \nApplicant was unemployed from September 2015 to February 2016. He supported \nhimself on his savings and unemployment compensation. (Item 7.) Applicant worked as a \ncontract service-desk analyst from February 2016 to August 2016, when his contract \nended, and the company decided to hire a different contractor. Applicant supported himself \non savings and on unemployment compensation received from at least November 2016 \nthrough April 2017. In June 2017, Applicant received a job offer from a defense contractor \ncontingent on him obtaining a DOD security clearance. (Item 7.) \n \n \nOn June 23, 2017, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of an SCA. \nRegarding the employment inquiries, Applicant stated that his federal employment ended \nfor the following reason:  \u201cMy Contract had ended for my agreement.\u201d He responded \u201cNo\u201d \nto inquiries concerning whether he had been fired from that employment; quit after being \nfired; left by mutual agreement following charges of allegation of misconduct; or left by \nmutual agreement following notice of unsatisfactory performance (SOR \u00b6 2.d). He also \nresponded \u201cNo\u201d to an inquiry concerning whether he had received a written warning, been \nofficially reprimanded, suspended, or disciplined for misconduct in that job (SOR \u00b6 2.e). As \nto why he lost his job with a federal contractor in August 2015, Applicant stated that he left \nbecause his contract ended, and he denied that he was fired; quit after being told that he \nwould be fired; left by mutual agreement following charges or allegations of misconduct; or \nleft by mutual agreement following notice of unsatisfactory performance (SOR \u00b6 1.f). (Item \n4.) \n \n \nApplicant also responded \u201cNo\u201d on his June 2017 SCA to an inquiry concerning \nwhether he had failed to file or pay federal, state, or other taxes within the last seven years \n(SOR \u00b6 1.g). (Item 4.) Available IRS account transcripts reflect Applicant had belatedly filed \nhis federal income tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2012, but he had not filed his \nfederal income tax returns for tax years 2014, 2015, or 2016 as of June 2017. His \ndelinquent federal income tax returns for those tax years were filed late in October 2017. \n(Item 7.) No account transcript was submitted for tax year 2013, although Applicant admits \nthat he filed late for that tax year. (Items 2-3.) Applicant did not disclose on his June 2017 \n\n5 \n \nSCA a state tax lien of $7,785 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) that was filed against him on April 13, 2016. \n(Item 8.) \n \n \nOn his June 2017 SCA, Applicant indicated that a financial judgment of \napproximately $3,000 had been entered against him in December 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.f) after \nhe fell behind on his payments due to unemployment. He explained that he had set up \npayment arrangements for the debt. (Item 4.) Available court records show that a judgment \nwas filed against Applicant by the creditor in November 2016 and that a consent judgment \nwas entered for $3,880 in August 2017. (Item 10.) Applicant also listed on his June 2017 \nSCA three other delinquencies of $900 (SOR \u00b6 1.j), $6,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.g), and $500 (not \nalleged in SOR) that he indicated he would begin to repay when he started working. (Item \n4.) Applicant did not disclose on his SCA that a $4,347 affidavit judgment had been \nentered against him in January 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). (Item 9.) \n \n \nAs of June 30, 2017, Applicant owed two consumer-credit judgments of $4,459 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e) and $3,954 (SOR \u00b6 1.f); charged-off balances of $13,388 on an unsecured \nloan (not $6,000 as reported on his SCA) (SOR \u00b6 1.g), $8,041 to the DFAS (SOR \u00b6 1.h), \nand $2,254 on a credit-card account (SOR \u00b6 1.i); and collection debts of $1,090 on a \ncredit-card account (SOR \u00b6 1.j), $306 for storage fees (SOR \u00b6 1.m), and three medical \ndebts (not alleged in the SOR) of $101, $97, and $38. Applicant\u2019s federal student-loan debt \nhad accrued to $40,517, and his account was rated as current. (Item 13.) \n \n \nOn December 19, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for \nthe Office of Personnel Management (OPM). About his employment history, Applicant \nexplained that he was unemployed since September 2016, but was in a defense \ncontractor\u2019s system \u201cas an employee awaiting security clearance to start physically \nworking.\u201d Applicant claimed that he left his defense-contractor employment in August 2015 \nafter his contract ended and that he left his job with the DOD in September 2014 because \n\u201che did not interview to renew employment for his position\u201d and that the position was \nmoved to another location. Applicant denied that he had any difficulties with any of his \nprevious employers. When asked about the adverse financial information on his credit \nrecord, Applicant did not deny the debts except for the DFAS debt, which he was disputing. \nHe claimed that his supervisor had signed off on his hours worked, and that the badge in-\nand-out system was faulty. Applicant explained that he had some credit cards that spiraled \nout of control, and that he obtained loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.g) to repay his debts but then \ncould not pay them. He attributed his delinquencies to unemployment and indicated that he \nwould begin to repay them once he began working. (Item 7.) \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed by a different investigator for the OPM on January 31, \n2018. He indicated that he had seasonal employment for two weeks in 2017 but that he \nwas again unemployed. When confronted about his termination from his defense-\ncontractor position in August 2015, Applicant stated that his supervisor would make him \nwork on tasks that were beyond his knowledge and familiarity, and he expressed his belief \nthat he should have received training. When asked to explain his removal from his DOD \nposition for being absent without leave and for conduct unbecoming a federal employee, \nApplicant stated that the allegations were untrue and that he never would steal time from \n\n6 \n \nan employer. He stated that he filed an appeal of his termination that was still pending. On \nMarch 5, 2018, Applicant told the OPM investigator that he intends to file for bankruptcy to \naddress his \u201coverwhelming\u201d debts, and had completed pre-counseling sessions. (Item 7.) \n \n \nThe OPM investigator re-interviewed Applicant on May 24, 2018. Applicant reported \nthat he began working in retail in December 2017. He indicated that, due to oversight, he \nhad not disclosed on his June 2017 SCA that he had been terminated from his defense-\ncontractor employment in August 2015. He explained that he had not reported the \ncircumstances or his termination on from his DOD employment because he wanted to \ndisclose the information in person to an investigator. (Item 7.) \n \n \nOn June 8, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by another OPM investigator. \nRegarding his finances, Applicant stated that he did not include all of his debts on his SCA \nbecause he had only a handful of account statements, \u201cwas going by memory for the rest \nof his debts,\u201d and figured he would discuss the rest in person. Applicant indicated that he \nwas still disputing the DFAS debt (SOR \u00b6 1.h). He asserted that he had filed a timely \nappeal of his termination, but that his initial attorney \u201cseveral months later\u201d referred him to \nanother attorney, who told him it was too late to file an appeal. On June 13, 2018, the OPM \ninvestigator obtained from Applicant \u201ccopies of documents pertaining to financial issue[s] \ncaused by employment issue.\u201d (Item 7.) Those documents were not included with the \nFORM. \n \n  \nWhen re-interviewed on August 8, 2018, Applicant indicated that he was no longer \nworking for the retailer because he found another job. He did not provide any details about \nhis new employment or the date that he left his previous employer. When confronted by the \nOPM investigator about the state tax lien filed against him in April 2016 for $7,785 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.d). Applicant acknowledged that he was aware of the lien for unpaid state taxes and \nexplained that he had insufficient withholdings in 2012. He indicated that he had started \nrepayment with the state but then dropped the payment arrangements without informing \nthe state when he became unemployed. When he tried to reinstate the repayment in 2016, \nthe state demanded half of his tax debt, and he could not afford it. He stated that the \nsituation would not recur because he would make sure he had enough taxes withheld from \nfuture earnings. (Item 7.) \n \n \nBy way of interrogatories, DOHA provided Applicant with summarized reports of his \ninterviews with the OPM investigators. Applicant affirmed on February 25, 2019, the \nsummarized reports of his interviews with OPM investigators were accurate, and he made \nno corrections or comments in that regard. In response to an interrogatory inquiry \nconcerning whether he had ever knowingly submitted an inaccurate time card or failed to \nsubmit a leave form for time that he was not at work during his federal employment from \nJune 2010 through September 2010, Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d and added, \u201cI have disputed \nthe claims alleged against me. I filed an appeal in October of 2014.\u201d In response to \ninquiries concerning whether he had failed to file federal and state income tax returns on \ntime, Applicant indicated that he had failed to timely file both federal and state returns for \ntax years 2015, 2016, and 2017, but listed only \u201c2018\u201d as currently unfiled. Applicant \nadmitted that he owed back taxes to the IRS of $18,240 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) for tax years 2010 \n\n7 \n \nthrough 2013, and that he owed back state taxes (no amount listed). He answered \u201cNo\u201d to \nwhether he currently had any federal or state tax liens against him for delinquent taxes. \n(Item 7.) \n \n \nWith his response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant submitted IRS account \ntranscripts for tax years 2010 through 2012 and 2014 through 2017. Relevant tax \ninformation as reported by the IRS is set forth in the following table. \n \nTax Year \nFiling Date \nAdjusted \nGross \nIncome (AGI) \nBalance due \n2010 \nDecember 19, 2011, \nafter November 22, \n2011 IRS inquiry for \nnon-filing; \npenalty \nassessed February \n13, 2012 for late \nfiling. \n$47,600 as single \nNotice of intent to \nlevy issued March \n25, 2013; $1,920 \ndue as of March 11, \n2019. \n2011 \nApril 1, 2014, after \nNovember 21, 2012 \nIRS inquiry for non-\nfiling; \npenalty \nassessed April 28, \n2014 for late filing. \n$45,533 as single \n$6,395 as of March \n11, 2019 \n2012 \nApril 1, 2014; penalty \nassessed April 28, \n2014, for late filing. \n$44,941 as single \n$6,053 as of March \n11, 2019 \n2014 \nOctober 12, 2017  \n$46,795 as head of \nhousehold \nApril 15, 2015 $478 \nof refund credited to \ntax year 2005 and \n$93 credited to tax \nyear \n2006; \n$0 \nbalance owed as of \nNovember 6, 2017. \n2015 \nOctober 12, 2017 \n$28,699 as head of \nhousehold \n$349 \nrefund \ncredited to tax year \n2006 on April 15, \n2016. \n2016 \nOctober 12, 2017; \nno \nevidence \nof \nextension to October \n2017.  \n$25,163 as head of \nhousehold \n$1,482 \nrefund \ncredited to tax year \n2006 on April 15, \n2017. \n2017 \nClaims filed, IRS has \nno record of filing as \nof February 2019. \nAGI not available  \nNot available. \n \n \n\n8 \n \nIn response to the March 29, 2019 SOR, Applicant indicated on May 11, 2019, that \nall federal income tax returns had been filed through 2018. He admitted that he had not \ntimely filed state income tax returns for tax years 2015 through 2017 but did not indicate \nwhether those tax returns have been filed. He admitted that he owed past-due federal \nincome taxes of $18,240 and state income taxes of $7,785, and the consumer-credit \ndelinquencies totaling $24,051 alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f through 1.m. Applicant denied that he \nowed the DFAS $8,041. He indicated with respect to the $4,944 judgment balance (SOR \u00b6 \n1.e) that he was repaying the debt \u201cdue to garnishment.\u201d (Item 2.) Court records of the \njudgment proceedings indicate that a writ of garnishment was issued for the debt in August \n2018 and that the garnishee reported being employed as of October 1, 2018. (Item 9.) On \nAugust 22, 2019, Applicant stated about the judgment debt that he now owes $1,500. (Item \n3.) As of October 31, 2019, Equifax reported a $1,533 debt balance with the creditor and a \nlast payment in May 2019. No progress was being reported by Equifax on the consumer-\ncredit debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f through 1.l. The storage debt in collection in 2017 was no longer \non his credit report, but there is no evidence showing it has been paid. (Item 11.) \n \nOn August 22, 2019, Applicant admitted that he was terminated from his DOD \nemployment in 2014 and defense contractor employment in 2015, but contended that he \nwas unjustly terminated from his federal job and that poor training was a factor in the loss \nof his defense-contractor employment. He admitted that he failed to disclose that he failed \nto timely file federal income tax returns for tax years 2010, 2011, and 2012 on his \nDecember 2013 SCA, but claimed that it was \u201can oversight.\u201d He admitted that he had \ndeliberately failed to disclose relevant information about his employment terminations and \nabout his delinquent tax returns and tax liabilities on his June 2017 SCA. (Item 3.) \n \nApplicant also indicated on August 22, 2019, that he plans \u201cto set up reasonable \npayment arrangements [for his federal tax delinquency] once gainfully employed.\u201d (Item 3.) \nThere is no evidence that Applicant has made any payments toward his past-due federal \nand state income taxes. The record before me contains scant information about Applicant\u2019s \nincome or expenses since 2017, so any reasonable assessment cannot be made as to \nwhen Applicant will be able to address the outstanding delinquencies on his credit record. \n                                                                                                                                              \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \n\n9 \n \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nAn applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage his finances \nin a way as to exhibit sound judgment and responsibility. The Appeal Board explained the \n\n10 \n \nscope and rationale for the financial considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-\n05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nGuideline F security concerns are established when an individual fails to comply with \nhis tax-filing obligations whether or not any taxes are owed. Available IRS tax transcripts, \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, or both establish that he filed his federal income tax returns late for \ntax years 2010 through 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Applicant admitted that he failed to timely file \nstate income tax returns for tax years 2015 through 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Given his state \nrequired him to report his adjusted gross income from his federal return on his state return, \nit is unlikely that he filed timely state returns for tax years 2010 through 2014 as well. \nHowever, the SOR does not allege timely failure to file state returns for tax years 2010 \nthrough 2014, and no information is in the record about his state tax filings for those years, \nso it was not considered. \n \nAvailable IRS account transcripts show that, as of March 2019, Applicant owed \n$1,920 for tax year 2010, $6,395 for tax year 2011, and $6,053 for 2012. A tax transcript \nfor tax year 2013 was not provided for review. Applicant indicated in February 2019 that he \nowed $18,240 in past-due federal income taxes for tax years 2010 through 2013 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.b). In April 2016, a state tax lien of $7,785 was filed against him for delinquent income \ntaxes (SOR \u00b6 1.d), reportedly due to insufficient tax withholdings for tax year 2012. \nApplicant also does not dispute that he defaulted on the accounts totaling almost $29,000 \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e-1.g, and 1.i-1.m. He contests the validity of the $8,041 debt to the DFAS \n(SOR \u00b6 1.h), asserting that his supervisor signed his time sheets and that he did not claim \ntime not worked. Under \u00b6 E3.1.14 of the Directive, the Government has the burden of \npresenting evidence to establish controverted facts. The DFAS debt appears on \nApplicant\u2019s June 30, 2017, August 22, 2018, and October 31, 2019 credit reports as a \ncollection debt. The Appeal Board held in ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, \n2010) that a credit report is sufficient to meet the government\u2019s burden of producing \nevidence of delinquency: \n \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for the \ndebt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n \n\n11 \n \nBased on the facts in this case, three disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 apply: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nThe burden is on Applicant to mitigate the negative implications for his financial \njudgment raised by his late tax filings and delinquent debts. Application of the aforesaid \ndisqualifying conditions triggers consideration of the potentially mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20. One or more of the following conditions may apply in whole or in part: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nConcerning AG \u00b6 20(a), Applicant filed his federal income tax return for tax year \n2010 in December 2011 and his federal income tax returns for tax years 2011 and 2012 in \nApril 2014. While those late tax filings were rectified some time ago, he then did not file his \nfederal tax returns for 2014, 2015, or 2016 until October 2017, and, as of February 2019, \n\n12 \n \nthe IRS had no record of him having filed an income tax return for tax year 2017. Applicant \nprovided no evidence confirming that his state income tax returns for tax years 2015 \nthrough 2017 have been filed. It cannot be reasonably concluded that his tax filing \nproblems occurred so long ago to no longer be of concern for his security clearance \neligibility. Moreover, Applicant has yet to make any payments toward his tax delinquencies \nor his other debts in the SOR with the exception of the judgment debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e, which \nis being repaid through garnishment. Applicant\u2019s debts are considered recent because \u201can \napplicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, \ncan be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. \nSept. 13, 2016)). AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to unemployment and low income, which \nare factors that could trigger AG \u00b6 20(b). After he was fired for cause from his DOD job, \nApplicant was unemployed from October 2014 through May 2015. He then worked as a \ndefense contractor only through August 2015, when he was terminated from that \nemployment for poor performance. He was unemployed from September 2015 to February \n2016, and again from August 2016 until December 2017, with the exception of two weeks \nin 2017. He collected unemployment compensation during part of that time. He worked in \nretail starting in December 2017 until he found a new job, sometime before his August 8, \n2018 interview. He was employed as of October 2018, as reflected in court records for the \njudgment debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e. When he responded to the SOR in August 2019, Applicant \nindicated that he plans to set up reasonable repayment arrangements for his federal \nincome tax delinquency once he is gainfully employed. Applicant was again unemployed. It \nis unclear when and whether he resigned, was laid off, or involuntarily terminated.  \nAvailable income information for Applicant shows his annual adjusted gross income was in \nthe mid-$40,000s before he was fired from his DOD employment. His adjusted gross \nincome for 2015 and 2016 was $28,699 in 2015 and $25,163 in 2016, when most of the \nconsumer-credit debts became delinquent. Low income and unemployment were clearly \nfactors that led to the delinquencies, but Applicant cannot fully benefit from AG \u00b6 20(b) \nwhere his financial problems resulted from his job loss caused by his own misconduct. \n \nI have to consider whether Applicant acted in a responsible manner when dealing \nwith his financial difficulties. See ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4, n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, \n2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-\n0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, \n2005)). A component is whether Applicant maintained contact with his creditors. Applicant\u2019s \nwages were garnished starting in the fall of 2018 to reduce the balance of the judgment in \nSOR \u00b6 1.e to $1,553 as of June 2019, but he made no efforts to arrange for repayments of \nhis other delinquencies, which include a $168 cable-television debt (SOR \u00b6 1.k) and a $146 \nelectric-utility debt (SOR \u00b6 1.l). There is no evidence that he remained in contact with his \ncreditors to inform them of his financial situation. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c), AG \u00b6 20(d), and AG \u00b6 20(g) warrant some consideration because \nApplicant belatedly filed federal income tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2012 and \n2014 through 2016. Although there is no evidence to corroborate a tax filing for tax year \n\n13 \n \n2013, there is no apparent reason why he would continue to ignore his tax-filing obligation \nfor that tax year, given he has caught up on his returns for the three tax years preceding \nand following 2013. He reported that he owes federal income taxes for tax year 2013. Even \nwhere an applicant has corrected his tax problems, and is motivated to present such \nproblems in the future, the administrative judge is not precluded from considering an \napplicant\u2019s trustworthiness in light of longstanding behavior evidencing irresponsibility. See \nISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015).  As recently noted by the DOHA \nAppeal Board, \u201cA person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her obligations, such as filing \ntax returns when due, does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and \nreliability required of those granted access to classified information.\u201d See ISCR Case No. \n18-01045 at 3 (App. Bd. May 14, 2019), citing ISCR Case No. 17-03978 at 3-4 (App. Bd. \nMar. 6, 2019). Without proof that he has filed a federal income tax return for tax year 2017 \nor that he has filed his delinquent state income tax returns, the security concerns raised by \nhis years of failure to comply with such a significant obligation are not fully mitigated. \n \n \nWhile some consideration of AG \u00b6 20(d) is warranted because of the reduction in \nthe balance of the judgment debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e from $4,944 to $1,553 by involuntary \ngarnishment, there is no indication that payments are currently being made. The most \nrecent payment of record for that debt is May 2019. Furthermore, involuntary garnishment \nto repay a judgment debt does not reflect the same good faith as had Applicant arranged to \nmake payments. Applicant has demonstrated no progress toward resolving his other \ndelinquencies, including his past-due income taxes. \n \nConcerning AG \u00b6 20(e), Applicant submitted no documentation in response to the \nFORM to indicate the debt is not his responsibility. He does not deny that he was \nterminated from his DOD job for reasons related to time and attendance, and it is \nreasonable to infer that the DFAS is seeking to recoup the wages overpaid to Applicant. \nHis uncorroborated assertions that the debt is invalid are not enough to disprove the debt\u2019s \nlegitimacy in light of other evidence indicating that he was terminated for cause from the \nDOD for time-and-attendance issues. He has made no effort to repay that debt. The \nfinancial considerations security concerns are not sufficiently mitigated. \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern about personal conduct is articulated in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigations or \nadjudicative processes. \n \n \nSecurity significant personal conduct concerns arise because of Applicant\u2019s time- \nand-attendance abuse that led to his termination from employment with the DOD in \nSeptember 2014 (SOR \u00b6 2.a), and his lack of candor on his June 2017 SCA about the \n\n14 \n \nreasons for why that employment ended. He falsely denied on his SCA that he had \nreceived any discipline when the evidence shows that he was investigated, placed on \nleave, and then removed for misconduct (SOR \u00b6 2.e). He claimed on his SCA that he left \nthe job because \u201c[his] contract had ended for [his] agreement\u201d (SOR 2.d). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s termination from his defense-contractor job for poor performance (SOR \u00b6 \n2.b) is an employment matter between him and the company that does not in and of itself \nimplicate personal conduct issues where there is no evidence that he engaged in \nquestionable judgment, was dishonest, or intentionally failed to comply with rules and \nregulations. A favorable finding is consequently warranted as to SOR \u00b6 2.b. However, \nApplicant attempted to conceal from the DOD that he left the job under unfavorable \ncircumstances by responding negatively on his June 2017 SCA about whether he was \nfired, quit after being told he would be fired, left by mutual agreement following charges or \nallegations of misconduct, or left by mutual agreement following notice of unsatisfactory \nperformance (SOR \u00b6 2.f). \n \n \nThe evidence also shows that Applicant was not candid on either his December \n2013 SCA (SOR \u00b6 2.c) or his June 2017 SCA (SOR \u00b6 2.g) about his failure to timely file \nincome tax returns and pay taxes. Both times, he responded \u201cNo\u201d to an inquiry into \nwhether, in the past seven years, he had failed to file or pay federal, state, or other taxes. \nIn Applicant\u2019s supplemental response to the SOR in August 2019, he admitted that he had \nanswered the tax inquiry negatively but indicated that it \u201cwas an oversight,\u201d which suggests \nthat it was inadvertent rather than intentional. \n \n \nThe Appeal Board has explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, \nstating: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has \nthe burden of proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, \ndoes not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the \nomission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record evidence as a \nwhole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence \nconcerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission \noccurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E \nand the burden of persuasion had shift to the applicant to present evidence \nto explain the omission. ISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, \n2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, 2004)). \n \n \nAs reported by the IRS and not contested by Applicant, he filed his federal income \ntax return for tax year 2010 in December 2011. Not only had he filed that return late, but he \nhad not yet filed his federal income tax returns for tax years 2011 or 2012 as of his \nDecember 2013 SCA. As of his June 2017 SCA, Applicant had not filed federal income tax \nreturns for tax years 2014, 2015, or 2016, and yet he denied on his June 2017 SCA any \nfailure to comply with his tax filing or tax payment obligations in the last seven years. If he \nwas acting in good faith and simply made an inadvertent error or mistake in December \n\n15 \n \n2013, he would have disclosed his noncompliance with his tax obligations on his June \n2017, and he did not. The evidence leads me to conclude that he intentionally concealed \nhis tax issues from his December 2013 SCA and his tax issues and adverse employment \ninformation from his June 2017 SCA. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 16, disqualifying condition 16(a) is established because of Applicant\u2019s \nfalsifications of his SCAs. AG \u00b6 16(d) applies because of his employment termination from \nthe DOD for misconduct related to time-and-attendance issues. The applicable \ndisqualifying conditions provide: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other \nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but \nwhich, when combined with all available information, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This includes, but is \nnot limited to, consideration of: \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer\u2019s time or resources. \n \nOne or more of the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 may apply in \nwhole or in part: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused or \nsignificantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n \n\n16 \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or \nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, has \nceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with \nrules and regulations. \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply in this case. His concealment of his tax \nissues was repeated. Although he was removed from his DOD position in September 2014, \nmore than five years ago, he lied on his June 2017 SCA about the circumstances under \nwhich his employment with the DOD ended. In December 2017, during his first interview \nwith an OPM investigator, Applicant falsely stated that he left his job with the DOD because \nhe did not want to interview to renew his employment, and he claimed that his position was \nmoved to another location. He attributed the DFAS debt to a faulty badge system. He \npersists in claiming he was wrongfully terminated because he would never steal time from \nan employer. His present denials of any culpability in that regard undermine his case for \nmitigation of his SCA falsifications because it casts doubt about his reform and whether his \nrepresentations can reasonably be relied on. The personal conduct security concerns are \nnot adequately mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n\n17 \n \nApplicant requested a decision on the written record, so it was incumbent on him to \nprovide the evidence that might extenuate or mitigate the poor judgment raised by his \nremoval from federal service, his unresolved delinquencies, his repeated noncompliance \nwith his income tax filing and payment obligations, and his deliberate misrepresentations. \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, he provided IRS tax transcripts for several years, \nshowing that most of his delinquent federal tax returns have been filed. That information is \nnot enough to overcome the security concerns that persist about several aspects of his \nbehavior. It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). After applying the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions to the evidence presented, I conclude that it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility \nfor Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.m: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.c-2.g: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_______________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017. In an \nundated response, Applicant addressed the sole allegation at issue and requested a \nhearing before a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge. \nI was assigned the case on March 7, 2019.  \n \nOn April 1, 2019, a notice setting the hearing for May 9, 2019, was issued. The \nhearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered three exhibits (Exs.), \nnoted as Exs. 1-3, and Applicant presented four documents, marked as Exs. A-D. All \nwere accepted into the record without objection.  \n \nApplicant was granted through May 17, 2019, to submit any additional materials. \nApplicant timely emailed the Government with a letter containing information she \n\n \n \n \n \n2\nwanted considered. It was forwarded to me on May 21, 2019, and accepted into the \nrecord as Ex. E without objection. The transcript of the proceeding (Tr.) was received on \nMay 29, 2019, and the record was closed. Based on the testimony, materials, and \nrecord as a whole, I find Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns. \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old senior systems engineer who has performed the same \ntype of work for over 20 years. She currently earns about $128,000 a year. Since 2005, \nApplicant has twice had periods of unemployment, from February 2017 to May 2017 \nand from April 2015 to July 2015. She also has her own business as a part-time venture \nwhich generates about $200 every few months. (Tr. 26-27) Applicant has earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree and has completed about a year of post-graduate studies. \n \nPresently single, Applicant is the mother of three children, one adult, one teen, \nand one child under 10. She lives with her two youngest children in a house she rents \nfor $2,645 a month. She receives no child support for the minor children living with her. \n \nDocumentary evidence in this matter is scant. The majority of the information \nbelow comes from Applicant\u2019s testimony: In 2005, Applicant began living in a property \nshe ultimately purchased the following year for $120,000 at 10.99% interest with 5% \ndown: \u201c[it was] a bad loan. I was 20 something years old. I just wanted to get a house, \nbut it was something that I couldn\u2019t do.\u201d (Tr. 34) The adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) \nonly seemed to go up when it adjusted. She unsuccessfully tried to get a loan \nmodification in 2009, when she was earning about $75,000 a year and the mortgage \npayment was about $1,620 a month. Her request was rejected because her income was \ntoo high. (Tr. 37) She then went into a repayment status paying $2,250 a month, \nfollowed by a second unsuccessful attempt at a modification in 2010. (Tr. 38-39) \n \nLater in 2010, Applicant tried to sell the house, but \u201cthe property value was so \nbad, it wasn\u2019t even worth it.\u201d (Tr. 40) In 2011, she again requested a loan modification \nafter incurring a $6,000 water bill due to a ruptured pipe. Meanwhile, without water, she \nand the children went to stay elsewhere. She then filed a hardship letter with her bank \nrequesting a loan modification. She was next rejected for relief in 2015, during a layoff. \nApplicant provided emails reflecting communication with her lender in 2016 and 2017. \n(Ex. B, Ex. D, which provide the only dated documentation of communication between \nApplicant and her lender regarding her situation)  \n \nIn late 2016 or early 2017, the house was subject to a break-in. Now feeling \nunsafe, and again subject to a layoff, Applicant made one more attempt to get a loan \nmodification. (Tr. 49) Meanwhile, she submitted payments, but they were returned \nbecause she had become delinquent. (Tr. 51) Frustrated, she and her family \nabandoned the home in September 2017. A short sale was discussed, but it was never \nattempted because she missed a deadline to accept a related offer. (Tr. 60) In sum, \nbetween 2010 and 2015, Applicant paid only delinquent mortgage payments or paid \nless than the full amount owed. (Tr. 56)  \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nIn January 2018, Applicant was informed that the house would be in foreclosure \nor up for auction. (Tr. 63) It ultimately was sold by auction for $115,000, leaving a \ndeficiency balance owed of $87,354.67. (Tr. 64-65) She was informed she owed this \namount in February 2018. With this information, she \u201cdidn\u2019t do anything because I didn\u2019t \nknow [what to do].\u201d (Tr. 66) She thought her treatment had been unfair and the process \n\u201ca really bad practice.\u201d (Tr. 66) Learning there was a class action suit against her lender, \nApplicant signed on as a claimant that month. She did so not by signing legal \npaperwork, but by signing and returning a postcard after answering some questions. \n(Tr. 69) From then on, she waited, not knowing what else to do. (Tr. 68) Since that time \nshe has taken no action and not contacted anyone about the deficiency. She has not \nconfirmed that she was made a party to the class action. She has no idea what the \nstatus of the class action is. Rather, she is waiting for someone to contact her. (Tr. 69) \nHowever, she currently has no plans to make payments on this delinquency because \nshe believes she is part of the class action. (Tr. 73) \n \nOverall, Applicant provides for her household. She has received financial \ncounseling. (Tr. 81) Her eldest child is away in a graduate program and is now \nfinancially independent, except for her car loan payments and car insurance. (Tr. 75) \nApplicant has about $180,000 in retirement savings. Her expenses exceed her income \nslightly, but she generally is able to have \u201ca little bit left\u201d at the end of each month. (Tr. \n84-86) Overall, she is \u201cliving within her means, but just barely. . . .\u201d (Tr. 86) She \npresently has a $2,000 state tax deficiency owed that she plans to pay off. (Tr. 89) Her \ncredit cards are in good standing. Going forward, Applicant intends to seek advice from \na credit counseling service and she hopes to work with a credit repair service to \nnegotiate better terms with her lender. She wrote that she intends to look for a second, \npart-time job. (Ex. E) \u201cIf all else fails,\u201d she will file Chapter 13 bankruptcy \u201cso any income \nleftover will go to [her] creditors for 3 to 5 years. Managed by a trustee, [Her] credit will \nbe reestablished over a few years. This is only after all other options have been \nexhausted.\u201d (Ex. E) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and \nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or \nproven by Department Counsel and has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a \nfavorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions necessarily \ninclude consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently \nfail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the national interest \nand do not question the loyalty of an applicant.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nUnder Guideline F, AG \u00b6 18 sets forth that the security concern under this \nguideline is that failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.  \n \nHere, the Government offered documentary evidence reflecting that Applicant is \npast due on a mortgage account that went into foreclosure status. This is sufficient to \ninvoke financial considerations disqualifying conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the inability to do so;  \nand \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nFour conditions could mitigate the finance related security concerns posed here:  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nThe debt incurred by Applicant related to her mortgage account was still existent \nat the time of the hearing, although the amount at issue is now apparently in the \n$80,000+ range rather than the $100,000+ range because the home was auctioned.  \nApplicant provided considerable narrative regarding her efforts to handle what became \nunwieldy monthly payments on that mortgage as her interest rate \u2013 as well as her \nincome \u2013 rose. With the exception of the 2016-2017 period, for which she provided \nmultiple examples of communications, the detail she provided on her efforts over the \npast dozen years seem credible, despite scant substantiating documentary evidence. \n \nApplicant\u2019s efforts appear to have ended in 2018. At that point, she apparently \ntook a passive stance, deciding to be reactive should some entity contact her, rather \nthan proactively continuing to work toward resolving her situation. It is also when she \ndecided to rely on a postcard soliciting potential members of a class action suit as \nevidence she had been so included, a status she has yet to clarify.  \n \nTo her credit, Applicant espoused a plan for tackling her debt following the \nhearing: to seek advice from a credit counseling service, to work with a credit repair \nservice to negotiate better terms with her lender, and to take a part-time job. As a last \nresort, she related that she would file Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which she believes will \nsatisfy her obligation in three to five years and reestablish her credit. The plan is not \nwithout merit, but there is no documentary evidence indicating she has implemented \neven the most initial steps in executing it. Like her reliance on the class action card, this \napproach is far too reliant on hopeful thinking and promises than it is on verified action.  \n \nWhile Applicant received financial counseling at some point, any progress on her \ndebt has been at a standstill for over a year, obviating applicability of AG \u00b6 20(c). \nFinally, I note the inapplicability of AG \u00b6 20(b). Taking Applicant at her word with regard \nto her efforts to modify her mortgage or otherwise ameliorate her situation, she chose to \npurchase the house at issue knowing its area and its financial terms. She acknowledges \nthat the terms were less than favorable and, apparently, she entered into the \narrangement without any financial guidance. Therefore, the upward machinations of the \nARM with which she was voluntarily encumbered cannot be said to have been beyond \nher control. None of the other mitigating conditions apply. \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of her conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Here, I have considered those factors. I \nam also mindful that, under AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based on \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old senior systems engineer earning about $128,000 a \nyear. She has a college degree and received financial counseling. In 2005, she was so \ndesirous of being a 20-something homeowner, she purchased a property in 2006 with a \n10.99% interest ARM. In her naivet\u00e9, she became overwhelmed as the rate seemed to \nonly move higher, becoming unwieldy. To her credit, she apparently made efforts to \nmodify the mortgage or otherwise ameliorate her situation, but without success due, in \npart, to her growing income. In 2018, after abandoning the house and around the time \nthe property went into foreclosure, she received a postcard soliciting potentially affected \nindividuals to join a class action suit against her lender. Assuming her return of the card \nmade her inclusion a fait accompli, she ceased working to resolve either her situation or \nher debt. Instead, she chose to take the passive role and await either the problem or the \nsolution to come to her. \n \nA year of inactivity passed before Applicant\u2019s hearing. After the hearing, she \nsubmitted a letter setting forth her plan to seek financial assistance and credit repair aid, \nas well as a second job, before considering Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection as a \nsolution. These ideas form the basis of a viable plan. However, she provided no \ndocumentary evidence indicating she has taken even the most preliminary steps in \nimplementing it. This process does not expect an applicant to satisfy all of ones \ndelinquent debt at the same time, but it does require that a workable plan be described \nand implemented. Here, that bar has not yet been met. Financial considerations security \nconcerns remain unmitigated.  \n \n   Formal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\n \n                            \n  \n    Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

Additionally, Applicant failed to timely file \nher state and federal income tax returns between 2010 and 2017, and she incurred a \nlarge bill for unpaid taxes. Applicant\u2019s failure to timely address her debts, as well as her \nongoing failure to file and pay her income taxes, undermine confidence in her judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s request for continued access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \n \nOn April 19, 2017, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to renew her eligibility for a security clearance required \nfor her employment with a federal contractor. Based on the results of the ensuing \nbackground investigation, Department of Defense (DOD) adjudicators could not \ndetermine that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nto have a security clearance, as required by Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) \n4, Section E.4, and by DOD Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive), Section 4.2. \n \n \nOn January 9, 2019, DOD issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts that raise security concerns under the adjudicative guideline for financial \nconsiderations (Guideline F). The adjudicative guidelines (AG) cited in the SOR were \nissued by the Director of National Intelligence on December 10, 2016, to be effective for \nall adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge at the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). This \ncase was originally assigned to an administrative judge on April 1, 2019 and scheduled \nfor hearing on April 25, 2019. On April 22, 2019, that hearing was cancelled sine die. \nSubsequently, a mutually agreeable schedule for hearing could not be established. \n \n \nI received the case on October 8, 2019, and I convened the requested hearing by \nvideo teleconference (VTC) on February 6, 2020. The parties appeared as scheduled, \nand DOHA received a transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 19, 2020. Applicant and \none witness testified. Department Counsel proffered Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 6. \nWith her Answer, Applicant provided documents included as Answer Attachments A \u2013 D. \nAt hearing, Applicant also proffered Applicant Exhibits (AX) A and B. All attachments and \nexhibits were admitted without objection. (Tr. 14 \u2013 21) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant did not timely file her \nfederal income tax returns for the 2010 \u2013 2017 tax years; that although she had filed her \nreturns for 2010 \u2013 2012 before the SOR was issued in 2019, she had yet to file her 2013 \n\u2013 2017 returns (SOR 1.a). It also was alleged that as of January 9, 2019, Appellant had \nnot yet filed her state income tax returns for the 2013 \u2013 2017 tax years (SOR 1.b); and \nthat she owed $24,287 for past-due federal income taxes (SOR 1.c). The Government \nalso alleged under Guideline F that Applicant owes 36 delinquent or past-due debts \ntotaling $87,969 (SOR 1.d \u2013 1.mm). Two of the allegations (SOR 1.v and 1.dd) address \nunpaid satellite television and cell phone accounts, respectively, and total $6,419. The \nremaining allegations addressed unpaid medical accounts that comprise about 93 \npercent of Applicant\u2019s non-tax debt.  \n \n \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted with explanation the allegations at \nSOR 1.v, and 1.w \u2013 1.bb. She denied with explanation the allegations at SOR 1.a, 1.b, \n1.dd, 1.ll, and 1.mm. Applicant indicated she could neither admit nor deny the allegations \nat SOR 1.c \u2013 1.u, 1.cc, and 1.ee \u2013 1.kk, and her responses thereto have been entered as \ndenials. (Answer; Tr. 8 - 9) In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, \nI make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant is 52 years old and has worked as a long-distance truck driver since May \n2005. She and her husband, with whom she drives as a two-person team, have been \nmarried since June 2000. Applicant previously was married from July 1986 until divorcing \nin February 1994. She had two children, now adults, during her first marriage. (GX 1) \n \n \nApplicant has driven on government contracts for her current employer since \nDecember 2016. She previously worked for that company between May 2005 and April \n2013. She then worked for a different trucking company, also on government contracts, \nuntil October 2015, when she fell ill while on the road for work. From October 2015 until \nNovember 2016, Applicant worked at home as bookkeeper for her husband while she \nrecuperated and he drove on his own. Applicant was first granted a security clearance in \n2006. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2) \n \n \nApplicant and her husband own their own truck and \u201clease\u201d its use and their driving \nservices to the transportation company with whom the government contracts the \ntransportation of sensitive materials and access to sensitive locations. Applicant\u2019s income \nis reported to the IRS as that of a contract employee. She receives IRS Form 1099s each \nyear and is required to report and pay her income taxes either on a quarterly or annual \nbasis. Much of her attention throughout each year is on accurately recording her work \nhours, costs of operation, and other factors required to accurately assess and report her \ntax obligations. To that end, since they started their long-distance trucking work in 2005, \nshe and her husband used an individual (T) to compile the necessary information in the \nform of receipts and driving logs and information from the transportation company. T then \nforwarded the information to an accountant / tax lawyer (H) whom Applicant and her \nhusband started using around the same time to file their joint federal and state income \ntax returns. (Answer; AX A; Tr. 25, 37 \u2013 45) \n \n \nIn 2011, Applicant was severely injured in a motorcycle accident. As a result, she \nwas unable to work for several months. The timing of her accident coincided with the \ndeadline for tax return filing for the 2010 tax year and Applicant did not file her federal or \nstate returns on time. It also does not appear that she requested an extension of the filing \ndeadline. Her 2010 returns were filed in August 2014. Applicant also did not file her 2011 \nreturns until October 2016. Her 2012 returns were not filed until November 2017. During \nthese tax years, aside from time off in 2011 recuperating from her motorcycle accident, \nApplicant steadily drove for the company that currently employs her. (Answer; GX 1; GX \n2) \n \n \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator as part of her \nbackground investigation in May 2018, she stated that her 2013 and 2014 federal and \nstate income tax returns would be filed by October 2018, and that her 2015 and 2016 \nreturns would be filed sometime in 2019. At her hearing, Applicant provided copies of \nprepared federal income tax returns for 2013 and 2014, but she did not establish that \nthose returns had been filed. Additionally, Applicant had not yet filed her returns for the \n2015 through 2018 tax years. Applicant claimed her failure to file was due, in part, to the \nfact that T developed cancer in 2016 and died sometime between 2017 and 2018. She \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nalso claimed H\u2019s involvement in a car accident in January 2020 caused her delay in filing \nher tax returns; however, in August 2018, H told Applicant she (H) could not complete her \nwork on Applicant\u2019s past-due returns until Applicant produced the information required to \ncomplete the returns. Applicant did not provide that information until early 2019. On \nFebruary 4, 2020, H told Applicant that her returns for 2015 \u2013 2018 would be ready by \nthe end of February 2020. (Answer; GX 2; AX A; Tr. 20, 24 \u2013 25, 40 \u2013 45, 48 \u2013 49, 50 \u2013 \n52, 63 \u2013 66) \n \n \nSOR 1.c alleges that Applicant owes $24,287 in unpaid federal taxes. Applicant \ndenied this allegation. SOR 1.c is based on Applicant\u2019s disclosure in Section 26 of her \nmost recent e-QIP regarding her 2013 taxes. Additionally, information she discussed with \na government investigator during her May 16, 2018 subject interview (SI) about unpaid \ntaxes supports this allegation. During her SI, Applicant did not dispute that she owed a \nsignificant unpaid tax debt and averred she would establish a repayment agreement with \nthe IRS to satisfy any past-due tax obligations; however, at her hearing, Applicant simply \ndenied that the IRS was trying to collect the tax debt described at SOR 1.c. Information \nshe provided in response to interrogatories in November 2018 showed that Applicant \nowed $20,257 for 2011 and $5,030 for 2012. Available information shows that the debt \nalleged at SOR 1.c is actually $25,287, an apparent arithmetical error. (Answer; GX 1; \nGX 2; Tr. 12, 22, 45 \u2013 46, 59 \u2013 62) \n \n \nIn October 2015, while on the road for a different transportation company, \nApplicant was taken to the emergency room. She had been found unconscious and in \nsevere respiratory distress. At the time, she did not carry any medical insurance. The \nmedical debts alleged at SOR 1.d \u2013 1.u, as well as the delinquent cell phone account at \nSOR 1.v, arose from that medical emergency and from her 2011 motorcycle accident. \nApplicant and her husband experienced a significant loss of income for the rest of 2015 \nand throughout 2016, because she could not drive and he was limited in how much work \nhe could take on as a solo driver on non-government contracts. In January 2017, \nApplicant and her husband resumed driving as a team and restored some of their lost \nincome. By operation of state law, most of the aforementioned debts may no longer be \ncollectable; however, there is no indication that Applicant addressed any of them or \nsought assistance in resolving them after she returned to work full time despite having \nreceived collection notices at or near the time her earlier debts became delinquent. \n(Answer; GX 1 \u2013 6; Tr. 12 \u2013 13, 57 \u2013 58) \n \n \nIn January 2018, Applicant was involved in another accident when the car she was \ndriving was struck by a tractor trailer. Applicant again was injured and lost significant time \nand income from work. In about July 2018, she returned to work full time. Additionally, \nshe also received a large civil settlement in May 2019 after filing suit in March 2018 \nagainst the trucking company operating the truck that struck her. The medical debts \nalleged at SOR 1.x \u2013 1.cc, as well as the delinquent cell phone account at SOR 1.dd, \nresulted from the January 2018 accident, and the proceeds from the civil settlement are \nbeing used to resolve those accounts. Applicant also indicated the settlement is sufficient \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nto resolve her outstanding tax obligations, but there is no indication that any such \npayments have been made. (Answer; GX 2 \u2013 6; AX B \u2013 D; Tr. 13, 23 \u2013 24, 55 \u2013 57, 61) \n \n \nApplicant and her husband have excellent reputations with their employer. The \ncompany\u2019s vice president for safety has known them since they started driving in 2005. \nHe believes they are reliable and trustworthy, and testified that they have not caused any \nsafety or security problems in their tenure with that company. That witness was aware of \nApplicant\u2019s medically related financial problems but was not aware of any problems \nrelated to Applicant\u2019s income taxes. As to their current finances, Applicant and her \nhusband live frugally and within their means. After their personal vehicle was totaled in \nApplicant\u2019s 2018 accident, they purchased an older used vehicle rather than incur the \nfinancing costs of a new car. They have owned their house for about 16 years, and there \nis no indication that they have incurred any new debts that they are unable to pay. (Tr. 34 \n\u2013 35, 74 \u2013 87) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are:  \n \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988))  \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations  \n \n \nThe Government established that Applicant has failed to timely file her federal and \nstate income tax returns since 2011. Available information also shows that she owes \n$25,287 in unpaid federal taxes for the 2011 and 2012 tax years. Additionally, the \nGovernment established that since 2011, she has incurred delinquent or past-due debts \ntotaling $87,969. This information reasonably raises a security concern about Applicant\u2019s \nfinances that is articulated at AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \n \nIn response to the Government\u2019s information, Applicant established that all of the \nnon-tax debts alleged in the SOR arose as a result of a 2011 motorcycle accident, a 2015 \nillness, and a 2018 automobile accident. All of these events were beyond Applicant\u2019s \ncontrol, and in some instances occurred nine years ago. These circumstances require \nconsideration of the mitigating conditions at AG\u00b6\u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long \nago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment) and 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected \nmedical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear victimization by predatory \nlending practices, or identity theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances).  \n \nAs to the debts incurred after her 2018 accident (SOR 1.x \u2013 1.dd), Applicant is \nresolving them with the help of her attorney and through application of the proceeds from \nsettlement of a civil suit she filed against the owners and operator of the vehicle that struck \nher. However, in the nine years after her motorcycle accident, or in the time after her 2015 \nillness, Applicant did not take any action to resolve the medical debts she incurred. \nAlthough it may not have been possible to pay those debts in view of the interruptions to \nher employment, the record is devoid of any attempt by Applicant to contact her creditors \nor to seek professional assistance in solving her financial problems. Further, her reliance \non the expiration of state statutes of limitation for reporting and collecting delinquent debts \nis misplaced. In addition to the risk that a person holding a clearance might engage in \nillegal activities to resolve delinquent debts, the Government is equally concerned when \none does not act in a way that indicates a willingness to accept responsibility for their \ndebts. Here, Applicant did not timely act in response to collection notices regarding her \nearlier medical debts. In view of the record as a whole, but for her receipt of a large civil \nsettlement in 2019, I have little confidence Applicant would have taken any action to \naddress her more recent medical debts. \n \nIt also does not appear that Applicant has acted responsibly to resolve her failures \nto timely file her federal or state income tax returns starting in 2011. Although there were \nintervening events that may have caused her to miss her filing deadlines, her 2010 \u2013 2012 \nreturns were all filed at least four years late. As to her returns since the 2013 tax year, \neven after being interviewed in May 2018, Applicant did not provide her accountant the \ninformation needed for filing until early 2019. As of the hearing, none of her past-due \nreturns had been filed. Applicant did not establish that she acted in a timely or responsible \nway to resolve her tax filing delinquencies, instead blaming other events for her failure to \nfile. In this regard, I did not find Applicant\u2019s testimony credible. Similarly, the \nGovernment\u2019s information, including Applicant\u2019s disclosures in her e-QIP and SI, \nsupported the SOR 1.c allegation that Applicant owes past-due taxes in excess of \n$25,000. Applicant\u2019s denials in response to the SOR and through her testimony at hearing \nwere likewise not credible. Applicant has been aware since she submitted her e-QIP that \nshe has an outstanding tax debt from 2011 and 2012; yet, despite receipt of a large civil \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \nsettlement, there is no indication she has arranged for repayment with the IRS as she \nsaid she would during her 2018 SI. All of the foregoing precludes application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(a) and 20(b). Likewise, there is no support for application of AG\u00b6 20(g) (the individual \nhas made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file or pay the amount owed \nand is in compliance with those arrangements). \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts and tax difficulties may have, at times, resulted from \ncircumstances beyond her control. But to mitigate the security concerns raised by these \nfacts and circumstances, it was incumbent on Applicant to take some action to resolve \nher problems; that is, to act in as responsibly as her circumstances permitted to address \nher financial and tax issues. Her failure to do so indicates flaws in her judgment and \nreliability that undermine confidence that she is suitable for continued access to classified \ninformation. The security concerns raised under this guideline are not mitigated. \nI also have evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed \nin AG \u00b6 2(d). The positive testimony of Applicant\u2019s employer is not sufficient to overcome \nthe doubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to sensitive information that have been \nraised by the Government\u2019s information. Because protection of the national interest is the \nprincipal focus of these adjudications, any unresolved doubts must be resolved against \nthe Applicant. \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n Paragraph 1, Guideline F: \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.mm: \n Against Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n                                        \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

After considering the FORM, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is a 39-year-old dual citizen of the United States and his native Iraq. Applicant has never married, but he has a five-year-old daughter, who was born in the United States in August 2014. As of August 2017, Applicant was paying child support at $700 a month. (Item 4.) He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in January 2017. Although he expressed an intention to renounce his Iraqi citizenship when he applied in July 2017 for a DOD clearance to work as a linguist for a defense contractor (Item 3), and indicated during an October 2017 subject interview that he had signed a form renouncing his Iraqi citizenship during a counterintelligence screening interview in August 2017 (Item 5), there is no evidence showing that he no longer holds Iraqi citizenship. Applicant was raised in his native Iraq. He is the third of eight children born to his parents, both native resident citizens of Iraq. His father retired from a position with the Iraqi government. His mother did not work outside the home. Applicant\u2019s siblings (an older brother and sister, three younger sisters, and two younger brothers) are Iraqi resident citizens. (Items 3-4.)

Price, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n02/20/2020 \nDecision \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant\u2019s parents and siblings are resident citizens of Iraq, and several family \nmembers are or were employed by the Iraqi government. Applicant has not adequately \nmitigated the heightened risk of undue foreign influence that exists because of his close \nties to his family members in Iraq. Foreign preference concerns were not established. \nClearance eligibility is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 31, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline B, foreign influence, and Guideline C, foreign preference. The \nSOR explained why the DOD CAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the \naction under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility \nfor Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective \nwithin the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n\n \n \n2 \nOn May 23, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested a \ndecision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On November 5, 2019, the \nGovernment submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing five exhibits (Items \n1-5). On November 7, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nforwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant and advised him that any response was due \nwithin 30 days of receipt. Applicant received the FORM on December 2, 2019, and he \napparently elected not to respond.1 On January 24, 2020, the case was assigned to me \nto determine whether it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant \nor continue a security clearance for Applicant. I received the case file on February 5, \n2020. After reviewing the FORM, I admitted Items 1 through 4 as Government exhibits \nfor the record.  \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \n \nIn its FORM, the Government requests that the administrative judge take \nadministrative notice of several facts pertaining to the Federal Republic of Iraq (Iraq), as \nset forth in a Request for Administrative Notice, dated October 31, 2019. The request was \nbased on seven publications from the U.S. State Department; a January 29, 2019 \nStatement for the Record from the U.S. Director of National Intelligence; a publication \nfrom the U.S. Department of Homeland Security; a publication from U.S. Customs and \nBorder Protection; federal Public Law 114-113; and Title 8 Section 1187 of the United \nStates Code. Applicant was reportedly provided extracts of the cited documents and the \nURLs where he could obtain the full documents. I was given only the URLs.  \n \n \nThe documents and laws relied on by the Government are proper for administrative \nnotice and are not subject to reasonable dispute. Applicant did not respond to the FORM, \nand thus he waived any objections to the administrative notice request or to the facts set \nforth therein. Appeal Board precedent, set forth in ISCR Case No. 05-11292, dated April \n12, 2007, requires that the administrative judge consider the most current political \nconditions in a foreign country when evaluating Guideline B cases. Accordingly, I \naccepted the Government\u2019s Request for Administrative Notice in the record, accessed \nand reviewed the full text of the publications relied on by the Government for \nadministrative notice, and took administrative notice of the facts set forth below. \n \nSummary of SOR Allegations and Response \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline B that Applicant\u2019s mother (SOR \u00b6 1.a), his father \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b), his three brothers (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and his four sisters (SOR \u00b6 1.d) are resident \ncitizens of Iraq, and that many of his family members, including his father, siblings, in-\nlaws, uncles, and cousins are or were employed by the Iraqi government (SOR \u00b6 1.e). \nNamed in the SOR are the Iraqi government entities that employ two of his brothers, one \nof his sisters, and a brother-in-law. The names of the government entities are not \nmentioned in this decision to protect Applicant\u2019s and his family\u2019s privacy. Under Guideline \n                                                 \n1 A January 22, 2020 memorandum in the file indicates that Applicant had a January 1, 2020 deadline to \nrespond, which is a federal holiday. There is no evidence that Applicant has filed any response to the \nFORM. \n\n \n \n3 \nC, Applicant is alleged to have served in the Iraqi National Guard from approximately \n2003 to 2005 (SOR \u00b6 2.a). (Item 1.) When Applicant responded to the SOR, he admitted \nthe allegations under Guidelines B and C without comment. (Item 2.) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the Iraqi residency and citizenship and the Iraqi \ngovernment employments of his family members, and to his former service in the Iraqi \nNational Guard, are accepted and incorporated as findings of fact. After considering the \nFORM, I make the following additional findings of fact: \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old dual citizen of the United States and his native Iraq. \nApplicant has never married, but he has a five-year-old daughter, who was born in the \nUnited States in August 2014. As of August 2017, Applicant was paying child support at \n$700 a month. (Item 4.) He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in January 2017. Although \nhe expressed an intention to renounce his Iraqi citizenship when he applied in July 2017 \nfor a DOD clearance to work as a linguist for a defense contractor (Item 3), and indicated \nduring an October 2017 subject interview that he had signed a form renouncing his Iraqi \ncitizenship during a counterintelligence screening interview in August 2017 (Item 5), there \nis no evidence showing that he no longer holds Iraqi citizenship. \n \nApplicant was raised in his native Iraq. He is the third of eight children born to his \nparents, both native resident citizens of Iraq. His father retired from a position with the \nIraqi government. His mother did not work outside the home. Applicant\u2019s siblings (an older \nbrother and sister, three younger sisters, and two younger brothers) are Iraqi resident \ncitizens. (Items 3-4.) \n \nApplicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in November 2004 from a technological \nuniversity in Iraq. At that time, he was serving in Iraq\u2019s National Guard at the rank of \nsergeant. He enlisted voluntarily because of the financial benefit and the lack of civilian \nwork in Iraq at the time and began active duty service in June 2003. He was discharged \nin July 2005. He then worked as an electrical engineer for a construction company in Iraq \nuntil November 2006. From November 2006 to July 2009, he worked on a reconstruction \nteam in Iraq providing linguist services in support of the U.S. government. (Items 3-4.) He \nhad yearly security screenings as part of his employment as a local hire in Iraq for his \nduties for the U.S. government. (Item 4.) \n \nApplicant came to the United States on a Special Immigration Visa (SIV) in July \n2009. (Items 4-5.) The United States granted employment fourth preference immigration \nvisa status to certain special immigrants, including Iraqi nationals who were employed by \nor on behalf of the U.S. government in Iraq for at least 12 months and met certain \nrequirements. See travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/special-immg-\nvisas-iraqis-employed-us-gov.html. He was cleared to immigrate in March 2009 and was \nissued the SIV in April 2009. He entered the United States on an Iraqi passport issued in \nJanuary 2007 and valid until January 2015. (Item 4.) After a brief period of unemployment \nin the United States, Applicant worked part time, as needed, as an interpreter and role \n\n \n \n4 \nplayer from November 2009 to March 2011. He indicates that he had a counterintelligence \n(CI) screening in June 2010 (Item 5) for that work. He also held a job with a company \nfrom November 2010 to February 2011. From May 2011 to October 2011, Applicant \nworked full time as a security guard. He left the job voluntarily, and worked as an \nequipment operator in the oil industry from October 2011 to August 2012. (Item 3.) \n \nApplicant attended graduate school in the United States from August 2012 to \nNovember 2013, and was awarded his master\u2019s degree in industrial engineering in \nDecember 2013. He returned to work for his previous employer in the oil industry in the \nUnited States until September 2015, when he was terminated for failure to show up for \nwork during his scheduled days off. Applicant collected unemployment compensation \nwhile out of work from October 2015 to April 2016. From May 2016 through at least \nOctober 2017, Applicant worked as a truck driver for a succession of seven different \nemployers in the United States. (Items 3-4.) \n \nIn January 2017, Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen on his own \napplication submitted in October 2014. He obtained a U.S. passport in early February \n2017. Later in February 2017, he renewed his Iraqi passport, which expires in mid-\nFebruary 2025. (Items 3-4.) He was in Iraq for his uncle\u2019s funeral and had entered Iraq \nusing his Iraqi passport that expired in January 2015. He used his expired Iraqi passport \nrather than his newly-obtained U.S. passport because he wanted to avoid the visa fee, \nand he renewed his Iraqi passport because under Iraqi law, he was required to exit Iraq \non a current Iraqi passport. That Iraqi passport bears a departure stamp from Iraq dated \nFebruary 27, 2017. (Item 4.) \n   \nIn June 2017, Applicant was offered contract work by a defense contractor \n(company X) to provide linguist services in Iraq to the United States military, apparently \ncontingent on passing a CI screening and background investigation for security clearance \neligibility. On July 24, 2017, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a security \nclearance application (SCA) on which he disclosed personal and family ties to Iraq, \nincluding his Iraqi citizenship and possession of a valid Iraqi passport. He stated about \nhis foreign citizenship that he was renouncing it as an employee of company X and that \nhe will surrender his Iraqi passport to company X following his CI screening. Applicant \nindicated that he had used his Iraqi passport in February 2017 to travel to Iraq but used \nhis U.S. passport while in transit through Qatar. Applicant disclosed on his SCA that his \nparents and siblings are resident citizens of Iraq, and he listed their employments showing \nthat, with limited exception, his family members are or were employed by Iraq\u2019s \ngovernment. Applicant reported that he had daily telephone contact with his mother and \nbrothers and weekly contact with his father and sisters. Applicant responded affirmatively \nto an SCA inquiry concerning whether he has or has had close or continuing contact with \nother foreign nationals within the last seven years. He listed ten persons with Iraqi \ncitizenship, eight living in Iraq and two living in the United States. Of the eight persons in \nIraq, four work for Iraq\u2019s government and one works for a public university; two are \nhomemakers; and one is a self-employed jeweler. (Item 3.) \n \n\n \n \n5 \nOn August 30, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator as \npart of his CI screening. He explained that he immigrated to the United States with a SIV \nbecause he wanted to start a new life in the United States, and he had previously worked \nfor the United States in Iraq and was concerned for his safety in Iraq. He denied that he \nhad any allegiance to any country over the United States, stating that he loves the United \nand that his affection grew for the United States because he was trained by the United \nStates military while he served in the Iraqi National Guard. He denied any ongoing \nassociation with anyone with whom he served in Iraq. He admitted that he sometimes \nmisses Iraq but has decided to stay in the United States and \u201cbecome something.\u201d \nApplicant expressed a plan to renounce his Iraqi citizenship, and to surrender his Iraqi \npassport to company X on completion of his CI screening. In the event of any attempts to \nthreaten or blackmail him, Applicant indicated that he would contact the U.S. government. \nHe could conceive of no situation where it would be acceptable to betray the U.S. \ngovernment. (Item 4.) \n \nDuring his CI, Applicant discussed his family members in Iraq, their employments, \nand his contacts with them. The family members with whom he has ongoing contact are \nset forth in the following table. \n \nRelationship to Applicant \nForeign employment \nFrequency of Applicant\u2019s \ncontact \nFather \u2013 resident citizen of \nIraq \nRetired in 2012 after 35 \nyears as power technician \nfor a ministry of Iraq\u2019s \ngovernment \nWeekly \nMother \u2013 resident citizen of \nIraq \nHomemaker \nDaily \nBrother age 44 \u2013 resident \ncitizen of Iraq (lives in \nparents\u2019 home with his \nfamily) \nOffice manager for Iraqi \ngovernment agency since \nOctober 2013 \nDaily \nSister age 42 \u2013 resident \ncitizen of Iraq \nOffice \nmanager \nfor \ncommittee \nof \nIraq \ngovernment \nsince \nJune \n2006 \nWeekly \nSister age 38 \u2013 resident \ncitizen of Iraq \nPublic high school teacher \nsince March 2006 \nWeekly \nBrother-in-law (spouse of \n38-year-old \nsister) \n\u2013 \nresident citizen of Iraq \nCommittee chairman in Iraq \ngovernment \nsince \nApril \n2014 \nMonthly \nSister age 30 \u2013 resident \ncitizen of Iraq \nAdministrative \nemployee \nfor Iraq government council \nsince June 2012 \nWeekly \nBrother-in-law \u2013 resident \ncitizen of Iraq (spouse of \n30-year-old sister) \nEmployee \nof \nIraqi \ngovernment \ncommission \nsince February 2010 \nWeekly \n\n \n \n6 \nSister age 32 \u2013 resident \ncitizen of Iraq \nTeacher \nat \npublic \nelementary school since \nApril 2011 \nWeekly \nBrother-in-law \u2013 resident \ncitizen of Iraq (spouse of \n32-year-old sister) \nProfessor \nat \npublic \nuniversity since May 2006 \nMonthly \nBrother age 27 \u2013 resident \ncitizen of Iraq \nLegal officer for council in \nIraqi  government since \nFebruary 2014 \nDaily \nBrother age 20 \u2013 resident \ncitizen of Iraq \nHigh school student \nDaily \nAunt \u2013 resident citizen of \nIraq \nHomemaker \nMonthly \nCousin \u2013 resident citizen of \nIraq \nLab technician for Iraqi \ngovernment ministry since \nJuly 2007 \nQuarterly (monthly as of \nOctober 2017) \nCousin \u2013 resident citizen of \nIraq \nProduction unit supervisor \nfor \nIraqi \ngovernment \nministry since December \n2002 \nQuarterly (monthly as of \nOctober 2017) \nCousin \u2013 resident citizen of \nIraq \nHomemaker  \nMonthly \nCousin \u2013 resident citizen of \nIraq \nJewelry store worker \nQuarterly \n \n \nApplicant also provided the names and occupations of 15 other extended family \nmembers (uncles, aunts, cousins) in Iraq, including three cousins who work for the Iraqi \ngovernment. He saw nine of these extended family members when he was in Iraq for his \nuncle\u2019s funeral in February 2017, including a cousin who has worked in intelligence for \nthe Iraqi government since July 2014. He has otherwise had no contact with these 15 \nfamily members in Iraq since January 2007. CI agent reviewers considered Applicant to \nbe a potential security risk because of Applicant\u2019s renewal and use of a current Iraqi \npassport to depart Iraq in February 2017 and his family members\u2019 employment with Iraq\u2019s \ngovernment, particularly in light of his older brother\u2019s employment and a cousin\u2019s \nintelligence duties. (Item 4.) \n \n \nOn October 30, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for \nthe Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant stated that company X took \npossession of his current Iraqi passport about a month prior to his OPM interview. He \nalso stated that he would renounce his Iraqi citizenship as soon as he is granted a security \nclearance and that he had signed a renouncement form at his CI screening in August \n2017. (Item 5.) Available records from that CI screening (Item 4) do not include any \nrenunciation form or other document showing action taken to renounce his Iraqi \ncitizenship. When asked about his contacts with family members in Iraq, Applicant \nprovided information consistent with what he had said during his CI with some limited \nexceptions. He related that he has not had any contact since 2007 with some of his \n\n \n \n7 \nextended family in Iraq, including no contact with the cousin who works in intelligence for \nthe Iraqi government. He disclosed his travel to Iraq for his uncle\u2019s funeral, but there is no \nindication that he told the OPM investigator that he saw several members of his extended \nfamily at the funeral. (Item 5.) \n \n \nBy way of interrogatories, DOHA provided a copy of a summary report of his \nOctober 2017 OPM interview for his review. On January 5, 2019, Applicant adopted the \nsummary as accurate with a few corrections, including that a friend discussed during the \ninterview was living in the United States and not Baghdad. Applicant also responded to \nforeign influence inquiries. He disclosed his previous service in Iraq\u2019s National Guard. He \nprovided information about his relatives in Iraq, which showed no changes in the Iraqi \ngovernment employments of his family members from what he had reported during his \nAugust 2017 CI screening. Applicant denied that he has any foreign financial interests, \nwhile also reporting that he had a new employer since March 2018 and was working as \nan electronics technician. Applicant answered \u201cYes\u201d to whether he currently holds a \nforeign passport because company X had returned his valid Iraqi passport to him \u201cabout \n3 months ago.\u201d He had not used that passport since he departed Iraq for the United States \nin February 2017. (Item 5.) \n \n \nAs of August 30, 2017, Applicant reported financial assets in the United States of \n$5,700, consisting of a 2008 model-year vehicle worth $2,000 and $3,700 in bank \nsavings. He owed $21,853 on a federal student loan, $1,716 on a credit loan, $2,926 on \na car loan, and $14,540 in credit-card debt. His monthly net income was $4,542, and after \npaying expenses and debts, he had $18 in discretionary income. (Item 4.) In response to \nDOHA interrogatories, Applicant did not provide updated information about his finances \nother than to indicate that he is making more money in his current job, which he started \nin March 2018. Applicant has no foreign financial assets, and he does not expect to inherit \nany property in Iraq. He denies voting or exercising any rights of his Iraqi citizenship since \nimmigrating to the United States in July 2009. (Item 5.) There is no information in the \nrecord about whether Applicant has voted in the United States or whether he is involved \nin community or other activities in the United States. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 16-02522 at 2-3 (App. Bd. July 12, \n2017); ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n. 1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-\n24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. \n10, 2004) and McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n. 4 \n(3d Cir. 1986)). Usually administrative notice at ISCR proceedings is accorded to facts \nthat are either well known or from government reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, \nSection 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). \n \n \nAfter reviewing the source documents relied on by the Government, I have taken \nadministrative notice of the facts set forth in the Government\u2019s October 31, 2019 request \nand incorporate them by reference in this decision. For additional background information \n\n \n \n8 \nregarding Iraq\u2019s relationship with the U.S., I have reviewed the U.S. State Department\u2019s \nBilateral Relations Fact Sheet, issued for Iraq on November 13, 2019. Consistent with my \nobligation to consider updated information in Guideline B cases, I have received the latest \nState Department travel advisory for Iraq issued on January 11, 2020. Of particular note \nare the following salient facts. \n \n \nIraq is a constitutional parliamentary republic. With the assistance of the United \nStates and in coordination with the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, Iraq liberated its \nterritory from ISIS in December 2017. The United States increased its efforts to stabilize \nliberated areas as Iraq continues to develop as a sovereign, stable, and self-reliant \ncountry. Iraq is now considered a key partner of the United States in the region and as a \nvoice of moderation and democracy in the Middle East. Iraq benefits from functioning \ngovernment institutions, including an active legislature. The United States maintains \nvigorous and broad engagement with Iraq on diplomatic, political, economic, and security \nissues in accord with the U.S.-Iraq Strategic Framework Agreement. Since 2014, the \nUnited States has contributed billions of dollars in humanitarian, de-mining, and \nstabilization aid to conflict-affected and displaced Iraqis in the region. U.S. security \nassistance programs support the development of a professional Iraqi military capable of \ndefending Iraq and its borders, responding to threats, and conducting counterterrorism \noperations, and promote civilian oversight of the military, adherence to the rule of law, \nand respect for human rights. Iraq\u2019s efforts to transition to a market-oriented economy are \naided by a significant increase in investment by U.S. companies in Iraq in the last ten \nyears. To increase trade, the United States has designated Iraq as a beneficiary \ndeveloping country under the Generalized System of Preferences program. \n \n \nParliamentary elections in Iraq in 2018 were imperfect but generally met \ninternational standards of free and fair elections and led to the peaceful transition of power \nto Prime Minister Adil Abd al-Mahdi. However, some human rights abuses persisted. In \n2018, civilian authorities did not maintain effective control over some elements of the Iraq \nSecurity Forces (ISF), particularly certain units of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) \naligned with Iran that were implicated in unlawful or arbitrary killings. Other significant \nhuman rights abuses included forced disappearances; torture and arbitrary arrest and \ndetention; arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy; restrictions on free expression, \nthe press, and the Internet, including censorship; legal restrictions on free movement by \nwomen; widespread official corruption; unlawful recruitment or use of child soldiers by the \nIran-aligned PMF; trafficking in persons; and criminalization of lesbian, gay, bisexual, \ntransgender, and intersex (LGBTI) status and conduct. Impunity existed for government \nofficials and security force personnel. \n \n \nISIS continued to carry out deadly attacks and kidnappings in Iraq, resorting \nincreasingly to targeted assassinations of police and local political leaders through \nshootings and improvised explosive devices (IEDs). With the cooperation of the United \nStates and the international community, Iraq improved its ability to detect and prevent \nterrorist threats and in disrupting terrorist activities by detaining, arresting, and trying \nthousands of suspected terrorists in 2018. Border security remained a critical gap in \ncapability as the ISF had limited capability to fully secure Iraq\u2019s borders with Syria and \n\n \n \n9 \nIran. Iraqi Shia militants conducted several attacks against U.S. diplomatic facilities in Iraq \nin September 2018 and December 2018. In January 2019, the U.S. Director of National \nIntelligence expressed that the PMF Shia militias supported by Iran remained the primary \nthreat to U.S. personnel in Iraq and that the threat is expected to increase as the tension \nbetween Iran and the United States increases. \n \n \nAs of January 11, 2020, the U.S. State Department\u2019s travel advisory for Iraq was \nLevel 4: Do Not Travel due to terrorism, kidnapping, and armed conflict. U.S. citizens in \nIraq are considered to be at high risk for violence and kidnapping. Terrorist and insurgent \ngroups active in Iraq regularly attack both Iraqi security forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. \nsectarian militias threaten U.S citizens and Western companies throughout the country. \nEffective December 31, 2019, the U.S. Embassy suspended public consular services until \nfurther notice because of the damage inflicted by Iranian-backed terrorist attacks on the \nEmbassy compound. Operations at the U.S. Consulate General in Basra have been \nsuspended since October 18, 2018. U.S. Embassy personnel in Baghdad have been \ninstructed not to use Baghdad International Airport due to security concerns. \n  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \n \n\n \n \n10 \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concerns about foreign influence are articulated in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that \nis inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents and siblings are resident citizens of Iraq. Applicant\u2019s father \nretired in 2012 after 35 years of employment with the Iraqi government. Six of Applicant\u2019s \nseven siblings are currently employed in Iraq for different agencies or departments of \nIraq\u2019s government. His youngest brother is a student. His older brother is employed as an \noffice manager for an agency that has security duties. Another brother is a legal officer \nfor Iraq\u2019s government. Some of the members of Applicant\u2019s extended family in Iraq work \nfor Iraq\u2019s government, including a cousin with intelligence duties. Two of Applicant\u2019s \nsisters are teachers and work in schools rather than directly in the service of Iraq\u2019s central \ngovernment or parliament. However, the spouse of one of Applicant\u2019s sisters heads a \ncommittee in Iraq\u2019s government. \n \nThe evidence shows that Applicant holds dual citizenship with his native Iraq and \na current Iraqi passport, and that he renewed his Iraqi passport in February 2017 after he \nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen. His Iraqi citizenship could impose obligations \ninconsistent with his U.S. citizenship that would make him vulnerable to foreign influence, \nespecially in Iraq. Neither his foreign citizenship nor his possession of a foreign passport \n\n \n \n11 \nwere alleged under either under Guideline B or Guideline C, so they cannot be considered \nfor disqualification purposes. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), \nthe Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in a SOR may \nbe considered, as follows: \n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for the whole-person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3. \n \nA person is not automatically disqualified from holding a security clearance \nbecause he has relatives with foreign citizenship or they live in a foreign country. \nHowever, if any applicant, his or her spouse, or someone sharing living quarters with \nthem, has such a relationship with even one person living in a foreign country, this factor \nalone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result \nin the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No, 08-02864 at 4-5 (App. \nBd. Dec. 29, 2009). Contacts and connections to foreign citizens are potentially \ndisqualifying if they present a heightened risk under AG \u00b6 7(a), or they create a potential \nconflict of interest under AG \u00b6 7(b). Those disqualifying conditions provide: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \n \n \nThe \u201cheightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having \na family member living under a foreign government. The nature and strength of the family \nties or other foreign interests and the country involved (i.e., the nature of its government, \nits relationship with the United States, and its human rights record) are relevant in \nassessing whether there is a likelihood of vulnerability to government coercion. The risk \nof coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government; a family member is associated with, or dependent on, the \nforeign government; or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against \nthe United States. Moreover, in considering the nature of the foreign government, the \nadministrative judge must take into account any terrorist activity in the country at issue. \nSee generally ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006). A heightened level \nof scrutiny is warranted when an applicant has a close relationship with relatives who \nreside in a country where elements hostile to the United States and its interests operate \nsomewhat freely. See generally ISCR Case No. 12-05092 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 22, 2017.) \n\n \n \n12 \n \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives, criminals, or terrorists from \nor in Iraq seek or have sought classified or economic information from or through \nApplicant or his family, nevertheless, it is not prudent to rule out such a possibility in the \nfuture. Despite Iraq\u2019s liberation of its territory from ISIS control in December 2017, Iraq \ncontinues to have a significant problem with terrorism from Iran-backed militias. The U.S. \nEmbassy in Iraq has suspended public consular service because of the damage inflicted \nby Iranian-backed terrorist attacks on the Embassy compound. The State Department \ncurrently advises U.S. citizens against traveling to Iraq because of risks of kidnapping, \nterrorism, and armed conflict. Iraq remains a dangerous place, despite the progress in \ncountering terrorism that targets Westerners and Iraqis. \n \nAs alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, many of Applicant\u2019s family members in Iraq are or were \nemployed by Iraq\u2019s government, some in prominent positions or in agencies or \ndepartments with intelligence or security duties. In carrying out their duties, they are \nrequired to further Iraq\u2019s interests, and some of Applicant\u2019s family members may well be \nknown to persons beyond their immediate sphere of influence. The issue under Guideline \nB is not whether an applicant\u2019s family members in a foreign country are of interest to a \nforeign government or entity based on their prominence or personal situation. The issue \nis whether an applicant\u2019s foreign ties and contacts create a potential vulnerability that a \nforeign power or terrorists could seek to exploit in an effort to obtain unauthorized access \nto classified or sensitive information. See ISCR Case No. 03-24933 (App. Bd. July 28, \n2005). Applicant does not have any ongoing contact with some of his cousins in Iraq, \nincluding with the cousin who has intelligence duties. However, his close bonds of \naffection to his parents and siblings in Iraq are evident by his regular contact with them. \nHe reported daily telephone contact with his mother and brothers. It is conceivable that \nundue influence or pressure could be brought to bear on Applicant through his \nunderstandably close connections to his family in Iraq. Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n7(a) and 7(b) apply. \n \n Applicant has a significant burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he cannot be \nforced to choose between loyalty to the U.S. and a desire to assist his immediate family \nmembers. AG \u00b6 8(a) provides for mitigation as follows: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a) does not apply because the foreign persons involved are immediate \nfamily with whom Applicant has close bonds of affection if not also obligation; there is a \nsignificant threat of violence and terrorist activity in Iraq; and there are ongoing human \nrights problems in the country. The risk of any of his family members being kidnapped or \npressured cannot be discounted. \n \n\n \n \n13 \nRegarding AG \u00b6 8(b), during his August 2017 CI screening, Applicant denied any \nallegiance for Iraq over the United States. He expressed an intention to remain in the \nUnited States. Even so, it is difficult to conclude that the bonds of affection and obligation \nto his immediate family in Iraq are similarly so minimal to satisfy the first part of AG \u00b6 8(b), \nwhich provides: \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the United States, that the individual can be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. \n \nConcerning whether Applicant has such deep and longstanding relationships and \nloyalties in the United States that he can be counted on to resolve any conflict in favor of \nthe U.S. interest, Applicant developed an affinity for the United States even while he was \nliving his native Iraq. While voluntarily serving in the Iraq National Guard from June 2003 \nto July 2005, he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree from an Iraqi university. However, in the \nGuard, he was trained by U.S. forces. He then worked on a reconstruction team serving \nthe U.S. military in Iraq from November 2006 until July 2009, when he immigrated to the \nUnited States with a SIV given after vetting and meeting certain requirements. Applicant \nearned a master\u2019s degree in industrial engineering in the United States in December \n2013. In January 2017, he became a naturalized U.S. citizen on his own application \nsubmitted in October 2014. Applicant chose to pursue his life and career in the United \nStates. His income is solely from U.S. sources. He has no foreign financial assets. He \nhas a five-year-old daughter who is a U.S. resident citizen for whom he pays child support. \n \nEven so, Applicant has maintained his Iraqi citizenship and passport. Applicant\u2019s \npossession of Iraqi citizenship and a valid Iraqi passport are relevant under Guideline B \nin assessing the relative strength of his ties to his native Iraq and the  United States in \ndetermining whether, in mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(b), he can be counted on to resolve any \nconflict in favor of the United States. After he obtained his U.S. citizenship and U.S. \npassport, he traveled to Iraq for his uncle\u2019s funeral in February 2017. He entered Iraq on \nhis expired Iraqi passport in preference to his U.S. passport because he did not want to \npay for a visa. He renewed his then expired Iraqi passport when he was in Iraq, apparently \nin accord with Iraqi law. In approximately September 2017, he surrendered possession \nof his Iraqi passport to the company currently sponsoring him for a clearance to work as \na linguist in Iraq, but the passport was returned to him in the fall of 2018. Applicant has \nexpressed a willingness to renounce his Iraqi citizenship, but it appears to be conditioned \non a favorable adjudication of his security clearance eligibility. Applicant is not required \nto renounce his Iraqi citizenship, and as a dual citizen, he is legally entitled to accept \nbenefits or privileges offered by Iraq. However, it undercuts his case with respect to \nestablishing that his ties to the United States are so deep and longstanding that he can \nbe counted on to resolve any conflict in favor of the United States. \n \nApplicant\u2019s willingness to support the DOD in Iraq as a linguist, including the \ndangers that service in Iraq entails, carries some mitigating weight under AG \u00b6 8(b). \n\n \n \n14 \nNevertheless, his family members in Iraq are at risk from criminals, terrorists, and human \nrights violations of the Iraqi government. Applicant presented no evidence from others \nattesting to his commitment to his work, his involvement in his local community, or other \naspects of behavior that could weigh in his favor with respect to demonstrating that he \ncould not be manipulated or induced to aid a foreign family member. It cannot reasonably \nbe said under AG \u00b6 8(c) that his \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so \ncasual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation.\u201d His connections to his family members in Iraq are not so \nattenuated to overcome the foreign influence security concerns. \n \nGuideline C: Foreign Preference \n \n \nThe security concerns about foreign preference are articulated in AG \u00b6 9: \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way to indicate a preference for a foreign \ncountry over the United States, then he or she may provide information or \nmake decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States. \nForeign involvement raises concerns about an individual\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness when it is in conflict with U.S. national \ninterests or when the individual acts to conceal it. By itself, the fact that a \nU.S. citizen is also a citizen of another country is not disqualifying without \nan objective showing of such conflict or attempt at concealment. The same \nis true for a U.S. citizen\u2019s exercise of any right or privilege of foreign \ncitizenship and any action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign \ncitizenship. \n \nApplicant\u2019s service in the Iraq National Guard from June 2003 to July 2005 could \nraise foreign preference concerns under AG \u00b6 10(d), which provides: \n \n(d) participation in foreign activities, including but not limited to: \n \n(1) assuming or attempting to assume any type of \nemployment, position, or political office in a foreign \ngovernment or military organization; and \n \n(2) otherwise acting to serve the interests of a foreign person, \ngroup, organization, or government in any way that conflicts \nwith U.S. national security interests. \n \n \nAvailable information falls short of establishing that Applicant\u2019s military service for \nIraq conflicted with U.S. national security interests. His military service occurred before \nhe became a U.S. citizen. He credibly indicated during his CI screening interview that he \nwas trained by U.S. forces while he served in the Guard. To the extent that any issues of \nforeign preference arise, they would be mitigated by his immigration to the United States \nand willingness to provide assistance to the DOD in Iraq. He immigrated to the United \nStates in July 2009 after working for the U.S. military in Iraq because he feared for his \n\n \n \n15 \nsafety in Iraq because of that work. His current desire to serve as a linguist for the United \nStates in Iraq shows his patriotism, loyalty, and fidelity to the United States. Concerns of \nforeign preference were not sufficiently established. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d), which are as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n  \nFurthermore, in weighing these whole-person factors in a foreign influence case, \nthe Appeal Board has held that: \n \nEvidence of good character and personal integrity is relevant and material \nunder the whole person concept. However, a finding that an applicant \npossesses good character and integrity does not preclude the government \nfrom considering whether the applicant's facts and circumstances still pose \na security risk. Stated otherwise, the government need not prove that an \napplicant is a bad person before it can deny or revoke access to classified \ninformation. Even good people can pose a security risk because of facts \nand circumstances not under their control. See ISCR Case No. 01-26893 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002). \n \nApplicant cannot control the decisions of his parents\u2019 and siblings\u2019 decisions to live \nand work in their native Iraq. While there is nothing untoward about his relationships and \ncontacts with his family members in Iraq, his present circumstances are such that he \ncould be placed in an untenable position of having to choose between the interests of a \nloved one and the U.S. As stated by the DOHA Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 08-10025 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2009), \u201cApplication of the guidelines is not a comment on an applicant\u2019s \npatriotism but merely an acknowledgment that people may act in unpredictable ways \nwhen faced with choices that could be important to a loved-one, such as a family \nmember.\u201d  Applicant presented no evidence from others attesting to his commitment to \nhis work, his involvement in his local community, or other aspects of behavior that could \nweigh in his favor with respect to demonstrating that he could not be manipulated or \ninduced to aid a foreign family member. Based on the facts and circumstances before \nme, concerns of undue foreign influence persist. \n\n \n \n16 \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline C:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue eligibility for a security clearance for Applicant. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \n \n______________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a-1.b, 1.h, and 1.n, with explanations. His admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. He either denied, or neither admitted nor denied the remaining SOR allegations. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began working at his present job in March 2017. He pointed out that his current position is somewhat irregular in providing full-time employment. He has been laid off several times and also works less than a full-time schedule. He has a high school diploma. He is twice divorced (married from 2006-2007 and from 2010-2015) and has three children. (Tr.2 at 21, 23; GE 1) The SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file his 2013-2017 federal and state income tax returns as required; and that he accumulated 14 delinquent debts (consumer debts, medical debts; and various other debt) totaling approximately $6,600. He admitted failing to file his federal and state tax returns during his October 2017 background interview. The debts were listed in credit reports from August 2017, May 2018, February 2019, and November 2019 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.p). (GE 3-7) Applicant attributed his tax filing problems to his divorce from his second wife. He claimed that in 2013 he could not resolve how to handle his taxes with his ex-wife, so he just did not file his federal or state tax returns for that year and c",

The DOD acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective on June 8, \n2017. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 18, 2019. The case was originally assigned \nto another judge on September 3, 2019. A notice of hearing was sent to Applicant on \nOctober 15, 2019, setting the hearing for December 2, 2019. Applicant appeared at the \nhearing and the case commenced. Shortly into the proceeding, the judge became \nconcerned that Applicant was not prepared for the hearing. Rather than proceeding with \n\n \n2 \n \nthe hearing, the judge continued the case to allow Applicant additional time to present \nevidence concerning his financial status. The judge stressed how important it was for \nApplicant to show up at the next hearing with documentation supporting his position. \n(See hearing transcript received on December 11, 2019 (Tr.1 at 31-34)) The case was \nreassigned to me on January 8, 2020. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on January 29, 2020, and the hearing was convened \nas scheduled on March 3, 2020. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 7, \nwhich were admitted into evidence without objection, except GE 6 which Applicant \nobjected to, but was overruled. Department Counsel\u2019s exhibit list and discovery letter \nwere marked as hearing exhibits (HE) I-II. Applicant testified at the hearing, but he did \nnot offer any documentation. DOHA received the second hearing transcript (Tr.2) on \nMarch 11, 2020.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a-1.b, 1.h, and 1.n, \nwith explanations. His admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. He either denied, \nor neither admitted nor denied the remaining SOR allegations. After a review of the \npleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began working \nat his present job in March 2017. He pointed out that his current position is somewhat \nirregular in providing full-time employment. He has been laid off several times and also \nworks less than a full-time schedule. He has a high school diploma. He is twice divorced \n(married from 2006-2007 and from 2010-2015) and has three children. (Tr.2 at 21, 23; \nGE 1) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file his 2013-2017 federal and state \nincome tax returns as required; and that he accumulated 14 delinquent debts \n(consumer debts, medical debts; and various other debt) totaling approximately $6,600. \nHe admitted failing to file his federal and state tax returns during his October 2017 \nbackground interview. The debts were listed in credit reports from August 2017, May \n2018, February 2019, and November 2019 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.p). (GE 3-7) \n \n \nApplicant attributed his tax filing problems to his divorce from his second wife. He \nclaimed that in 2013 he could not resolve how to handle his taxes with his ex-wife, so he \njust did not file his federal or state tax returns for that year and continued not to file for \nsubsequent years. He claimed that he went to two tax preparing services, but he did not \nuse either one to file his returns. He still has not filed his federal or state returns for tax \nyears 2013-2017. (Tr.2 at 28-29, 36-40; GE 2-3) \n \n \nApplicant failed to document that he addressed any of his delinquent debts, \neither through payments, or proof of a legitimate dispute over the debt. He claimed that \nhe was on a payment plan for one of the debts (SOR 1.c) and making small payments \nuntil he could no longer afford to do so. He failed to provide documentation supporting \nthis assertion. All the debts remain unpaid. In addition to the unpaid SOR debts, \nApplicant also testified that he was in arrears on his child support, behind on four car \n\n \n3 \n \npayments, and delinquent on his cell phone bill (these debts were not alleged in the \nSOR, so I will not consider them for disqualification purposes, but I may consider them \nwhen applying the mitigating conditions and whole-person factors). Applicant stated that \nhe was unable to make any progress toward paying his debts because of his reduced \nwork schedule. He has tried to supplement his income with outside construction work, \nbut it has not produced significant income for him. Applicant stated that some of his \nmedical debts were due to a heart condition that he was treated for in 2014 or 2015. \n(Tr.2 at 22-23, 29-34) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n\n \n4 \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and   \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant failed to file his 2013-2017 federal and state income tax returns and \naccumulated 14 delinquent debts. He provide no documentation that his taxes have \nbeen filed or that he made payments toward his debts. I find all the above disqualifying \nconditions are raised.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n\n \n5 \n \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent and remain unpaid. He failed to produce evidence \nshowing that recurrence of his financial problems is unlikely. On the contrary, he \ntestified that he has additional financial problems in the form of an +overdue car and cell \nphone payments. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s sporadic work schedule and medical issues are circumstances \nbeyond his control. However, he did not act responsibly by failing to take any action to \nresolve his debts or file his federal and state tax returns. Overall, the record evidence \ndoes not support that Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) \nis partially applicable.  \n \n \n \nApplicant presented no evidence of financial counseling. He has done nothing to \naddress his tax returns or his delinquent debts. He presented no evidence that he was \nworking with the IRS or the state tax authority to file his tax returns. He failed to put forth \ngood-faith efforts to pay or resolve the debts or file his tax returns for 2013-2017. He \nfailed to document any viable dispute of any debts. None of the above mitigating \nconditions apply.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.       \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s federal contractor service, his medical issue, his \nsporadic working schedule, and the circumstances surrounding his indebtedness. \nHowever, I also considered that he has made no efforts to resolve his debts or file his \nfederal and state tax returns. He has not established a meaningful track record of debt \nmanagement, which causes me to question his ability to resolve his future debts.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. (I \nconsidered the exceptions under Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, \nAppendix C, dated June 8, 2017, and determined they are not applicable in this case.)   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs: 1.a \u2013 1.p  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRobert E.

The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017. \nIn a response notarized on January 16, 2019, Applicant admitted six of seven \nallegations. He also requested a hearing before a Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) administrative judge. I was assigned the case on April 4, 2019.  \nOn June 10, 2019, a notice was issued setting the hearing for July 3, 2019. The \nhearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered 11 exhibits, marked as \nGov\u2019t. Exs. (GE) 1-11. Each of those exhibits was accepted over Applicant\u2019s objections. \nApplicant presented 56 documents, marked as App. Exs. (AE) 1-56. With no objections, \nall exhibits were accepted into the record. Applicant was granted through July 19, 2019, \n\n \n \n \n \n2\nto submit any additional materials, with leave to request an extension into the beginning \nof the autumn 2019 academic term. The transcript (Tr.) was received on July 18, 2019. \nApplicant submitted additional documentation in January 2020. On February 4, 2020, the \nGovernment noted no objection and the items were accepted as AE 57-59. The record \nwas then closed. Based on the testimony, materials, and record as a whole, I find \nApplicant mitigated financial considerations security concerns. \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old compliance specialist who has worked in that capacity \nfor nearly two years. He has earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration and \nan associate\u2019s degree in management. He is currently working toward a master\u2019s degree. \n(Tr. 34) Applicant is well-regarded amongst his professional and work peers, and recently \nreceived a sizeable salary raise. He served in one branch of the United States military on \nactive duty, then in another branch as both a reservist and on active duty. This occurred \nbetween 1998, shortly after his high school graduation, and 2003. In the interim, while \nliving independently and away from home for the first time, he lived beyond his means. \nThis led him to file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in 2002, while still in his early \n20s. In 2003, he received a general discharge from the military \u201cnot for the performance \nof [his] work, [but] for not being able to sustain [his] financial obligations.\u201d (Tr. 51-52) \n \n \nToday, Applicant is married. The couple has two preteen children. Both children \nexperienced differing allergic conditions from birth to about age two, requiring special care \nand products that adversely impacted Applicant financially during intermittent periods of \nemployment and of unemployment. (Tr. 31-32). \n \n \nIn 2006, Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection, which included the \nrollover of the 2002 bankruptcy petition which had been dismissed in June 2004. (Tr. 53) \nHe did so on the advice of counsel. This included debts related to the couples\u2019 necessities, \nmedical services, and other obligations accrued during periods of unemployment or \nunderemployment by one or both of the spouses. Without thus resorting to bankruptcy, \nhe had been unable to maintain payment arrangements or otherwise meet his obligations \ndespite taking a secondary job. (Tr. 53) Ultimately, that bankruptcy action was dismissed \nin October 2006 for failure to make timely payments.  \n \n \nIn about October 2009, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy regarding his \npersonal debts. The bankruptcy was discharged in January 2010, giving him a clean slate. \nHe was unemployed for two six-month periods in 2009 and 2011. He then lost health \ninsurance coverage in 2012, leading to a period of inadequate coverage from 2012 to \n2017, during which his children suffered their allergy problems. (Tr. 71) \n \nIn September 2015, however, the couple filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which \nincluded mostly medical bills and related debts. (Tr. 57) Some of those medical bills were \nnew, were for addressing the children\u2019s allergy needs, or for his wife\u2019s medical treatments \nduring periods of unemployment (2009 and 2011). He failed to make or was late making \npayments in January 2016, October 2016, July 2017, October 2017, November 2017, \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nJanuary 2018, August 2018, and September 2018. Some of these payments were \ninterrupted because the family incurred additional debt for child care and education in \npreparation for a relocation. (Tr. 77) To date, however, they have paid about $30,000 \ntoward the bankruptcy petition balance with a current balance remaining of under $11,000 \nto be paid by October 2021. (Tr. 58-59) The payment schedule and balances due are \nmanageable.  \n \nAt present, Applicant is living within his means. Each month, after all expenses \nand obligations, he has a net remainder of about $3,200, and he has a $5,000 promotion \nanticipated in the foreseeable future. (Tr. 36-37) He is current on his credit cards. The \nfamily has not had any extravagant expenses or vacations in recent times. They actively \ncontribute to a savings account and a 401k account. (Tr. 42) Applicant has two late model \nvehicles (2008 and 2011) included in his bankruptcy petition. His wife works as an office \nmanager. (Tr. 38) Applicant\u2019s wife manages the household accounts. A balance owed to \nan academic institution for contested fees in the amount of $6,479 has been satisfied. \n(AE 57-59) \n \nApplicant had a past-due amount of $1,099 due on a total balance of $16,360. This \nwas for a new vehicle bought in 2017 to replace an unreliable car his wife had been using \nfor transporting the children. That account is now current. (Tr. 65-66; Ex. 9)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence, and transcends \nduty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in those \ngranted such access. Decisions necessarily include consideration of the possible risk an \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions \nshall be in terms of the national interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nUnder Guideline F, AG \u00b6 18 sets forth that the security concern under this guideline \nis that failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by \nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.  \n \nHere, the Government offered documentary evidence reflecting that Applicant has \nnumerous delinquent debts. This is sufficient to invoke financial considerations \ndisqualifying conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \nand \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nUnder these facts, three conditions could mitigate related security concerns:  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problems from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or under control; and  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nOver the years, varying reasons contributed to Applicant\u2019s acquisition of delinquent \ndebt, ranging from youthful naivet\u00e9, unexpected medical care or needs, and periods of \nunemployment or underemployment, to insufficient regular income to provide for his \ngrowing family\u2019s needs. Those unforeseeable conditions concerning medical care and \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nemployment potentially raise AG \u00b6 20(b). The evidence shows that he attempted to seek \nbankruptcy protection on multiple occasions and also took on a second job. While \nbankruptcy is not the preferred method for addressing one\u2019s financial issues, it is a legally \naccepted tool for finding financial relief, it also includes required financial counseling. \nMoreover, Applicant showed he has learned from both his past mistakes and his past \nfinancial mishandling. He has matured. He is now current on his debts and bills, \napparently benefitted from his most recent financial counseling, in timely repayment on \nhis Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition, and has satisfied his academic fees. Consequently, \nAG \u00b6 20(b) - AG \u00b6 20(d) apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Here, I have considered those factors. I am also \nmindful that, under AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \na security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based on careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nAt the cusp of age 40, Applicant has grown from a raw military recruit fresh from \nhigh school with little life experience to a maturing father of two. Along the way, he has \nfaced various financial obstacles, such as breaks in income, variances in the levels of the \nhousehold coffers, and unexpected financial obligations. His income and his needs are \nnow in synch, helped by improvement in his family\u2019s health issues, his wife\u2019s employment, \nand a higher, consistent salary. He has satisfied some of his older debts. Going forward, \nhe is addressing his remaining debts through his Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition, on which \nhe is making timely and regular payments. The required payments are realistic, the \nbalance owed can be reasonably satisfied given his income and resources, and is \ncommitted to resolving his financial situation.

The DOD \nCAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; and DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive) and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective June \n8, 2017. \n \n \n\n2 \n \nOn September 25, 2019, Applicant answered the SOR, admitting the allegation and \nrequesting a hearing. On January 22, 2020, Department Counsel amended the SOR \nalleging an additional security concern under Guideline B, foreign influence. Applicant \nresponded on February 1, 2020, admitting that allegation. \n \n  The case was assigned to me on February 6, 2020. On February 26, 2020, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing, scheduling Applicant\u2019s \ncase for March 25, 2020. Because of the COVID-19 Pandemic, that hearing was canceled. \nOn July 10, 2020, the court issued a notice rescheduling the case for August 5, 2020. The \nhearing was held as rescheduled. I received Government Exhibit (GE) 1 and GE 3 through \nGE 6. I admitted the first six pages of GE 2, and reserved judgment on the admissibility of \nthe remainder of GE 2. I received Applicant Exhibit (AE) A through AE H. I also took \nadministrative notice, at Department Counsel\u2019s request, of the facts set forth in six \ndocuments marked as Administrative Notice Document (AN) I through AN VI. The transcript \n(Tr.) was received on August 17, 2020. \n \nRulings of Procedure and Evidence \n \n \nPages seven through ten of GE 2 are part of a document entitled \u201c[Applicant\u2019s] \nNetwork Activity Investigation, 1/5/2015.\u201d Applicant\u2019s counsel objected to its admission, \narguing that as an unsigned document with no identifying markers such as a company \nletterhead, it was unauthenticated. I reserved judgment and left the record open through \nAugust 26, 2020 to consider any additional evidence or argument regarding the \nadmissibility of GE 2 in its entirety.  \n \nWithin the time allotted, Department Counsel submitted an additional exhibit, a copy \nof an e-mail from Applicant\u2019s former supervisor, concerning the investigative report, which I \nmarked as GE 7. On August 26, 2012, Applicant\u2019s counsel e-mailed me in response to \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s submission of GE 7 that I incorporated into the record as AE I. He \ndid not object to GE 7, but renewed his objection to the admissibility of GE 2, pages seven \nthrough ten. Upon considering the argument of the parties and the additional exhibits, I \nadmitted GE 2 pages seven through ten into the record.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old single man. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2009, and \na bachelor\u2019s degree in 2013. (Tr. 28) For the past 12 years, he has been working in the \ninformation technology field. (Tr. 12, 53) Most recently, since 2018, he has been working \nfor a defense contractor as an information technology specialist. (Tr. 48) He currently holds \npublic trust access to sensitive information. (Tr. 66)  \n \n \nApplicant is a native of Cameroon. He has been a naturalized citizen of the United \nStates since 2011.  (Tr. 37) He immigrated to the United States when he was 11 years old \nand spent the remainder of his childhood living with his uncle, a U.S. citizen. (Tr. 32, 43) In \naddition to raising Applicant after he immigrated to the United States, his uncle helped \nfinance his education. (Tr. 43) When Applicant first moved to the United States, it was very \n\n3 \n \nexpensive to make long-distance calls to Cameroon. (Tr. 39) Consequently, Applicant\u2019s \nparents seldom talked to him. Similarly, they did not often travel to the United States to visit \nhim. Applicant did not hear from his parents or see them for nine years after he relocated. \n(Tr. 39) Ultimately, although Applicant\u2019s relationship with his parents is cordial, he has more \nof a parental relationship with his uncle than his parents. (Tr. 43)  \n \n \nCurrently, Applicant\u2019s parents have permanent U.S. residence status. (Tr. 43) They \nmoved here in 2017.  Later, Applicant\u2019s mother returned to Cameroon. She owns a store \nthat sells baby products. (Tr. 40) Typically, Applicant talks to his mother twice per month. \nSince the pandemic, he has been talking to her daily. (Tr. 43) Applicant\u2019s parents remain \nmarried. Applicant\u2019s mother travels to the United States approximately two to three times \nper year to visit Applicant and his father. (Answer to Amendment to the SOR, at 2; Tr. 41) \nApplicant last travelled to Cameroon to visit his mother in 2013. (GE 1 at 38) \n \n \nWhen Applicant\u2019s father lived in Cameroon, he owned a cleaning business. (Tr. 39) \nHe suffered a massive, debilitating stroke in 2017. (Tr. 40) Partially paralyzed and non-\nverbal, it is unlikely that he will return to Cameroon.  \n \n \nApplicant has approximately $27,000 invested in retirement accounts. (Tr. 35) He \nowns no assets in Cameroon. (Tr. 36) \n \n \nThe United States has had diplomatic relations with Cameroon since Cameroon\u2019s  \nindependence in 1960. (AN I at 1) Cameroon \u201cplays a key role in regional stability and [is] \nthe strongest regional partner in countering terrorism\u201d in the region. (AN I at 1) Cameroon \nand the United States are closely engaged in issues that address democracy, governance, \nregional security, environmental protection, health, and economic development. (AN I at 2) \nCameroon has struggled to contain terrorism, particularly in its rural, remote region in the \nnorth, where Boko Haram is active, borders are porous, and there is a political insurgency. \n(AN II at 1) Applicant\u2019s mother does not live near this area. \n \n \nIn July 2014, Applicant began a job as a help desk administrator. His duties included \nmaintaining the server and monitoring the network for malware. (GE 2 at 7) Applicant\u2019s \ncareer goal was to earn a promotion to work on cyber-security projects. (GE 2 at 7; Tr. 49) \nWhile working at this job, Applicant was working towards earning a cyber-security \ncertification.  \n \n \nOn December 19, 2014, Applicant\u2019s employer identified suspicious activity on \nApplicant\u2019s computers. Specifically, an analysis of one of Applicant\u2019s computers indicated \nthat he attempted to initiate a peer-to-peer connection with a remote host outside of his \nemployer\u2019s network. This type of activity was prohibited because of its potential to bypass \nthe employer\u2019s security measures. (GE 2 at 7) Further review of Applicant\u2019s computer use \n\u201cdiscovered attempts to obscure Internet activity by using an anonymous proxy that would \nhide the destination from [the employer\u2019s] IT security systems, as well as frequent visits to \nquestionable download websites as far back as September 2015.\u201d (GE 2 at 7)  Moreover, \nApplicant was visiting websites that provided tutorials regarding how to crack passwords \nand conduct network attacks, and that he had downloaded a copy of pirated software onto \n\n4 \n \nthe network. (GE 2 at 9) After an investigation, Applicant was terminated for violation of his \nemployer\u2019s Internet use policy. (Answer at 1-2) \n \n \n \nApplicant admits that he demonstrated bad judgment accessing some of his \n\u201cpersonal stuff\u201d on his work computer. (Tr. 58) However, he contends that he visited \nhacking-related websites for educational and professional development, and that cyber-\nsecurity experts need to understand how hackers operate in order to defend against them. \n(Answer at 2; Tr. 56) He characterized this concept as \u201cethical hacking,\u201d and testified that \nhe was earning an online certification in this field while he was working for his former \nemployer. (Tr. 54) Applicant contends that his employer allowed him to use the office \ncomputer for studying and practical assignments related to his certification during down \ntime. Also, Applicant testified that he made a mistake by not memorializing this permission \nin writing. (Tr. 57-58; 119)   \n \n \nThere were occasions on Applicant\u2019s job when information technology specialists \nmight need to visit websites related to hacking for research, or download password-\ncracking software to gain access to a system where a password was lost. These situations \nwere exceedingly rare. (GE 2 at 8) Applicant\u2019s employer characterized the volume of \nhacking-related content combined with the absence of any specific project that required \nthat type of information \u201cdisconcerting,\u201d and characterized Applicant\u2019s behavior as a \ndemonstration of \u201cincredibly poor judgment.\u201d (GE 2 at 9) Subsequently, Applicant was \nterminated from his job.  \n \nAfter Applicant\u2019s termination, he completed the certificate in ethical hacking that he \nhad been working on while employed. (Tr. 69) In the past five years, he has completed \nmultiple trainings, including an insider threat training and two cybersecurity awareness \ntrainings. (AE B \u2013 AE E) He took these courses to ensure that mistakes such as those \nwhich led to his termination in 2015, do not recur. (Answer at 2) \n \nApplicant informed all of his subsequent employers of the circumstances related to \nthe 2015 termination. He is highly respected on the job. According to a coworker, he is \u201ca \nvery trustworthy, hardworking, diligent individual,\u201d whose knowledge of cybersecurity and \nthe rules that govern cybersecurity is unparalleled. (AE F) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied together with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \n\n5 \n \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive \nOrder 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n\n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \n          The security concern under Guideline B is set forth in AG \u00b6 6, as follows: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to  pressure or \ncoercion by any foreign interest.   \n \n       Cameroon is an ally of the United States and there is no record evidence that \nCameroon is engaging in espionage against the United States. However, Cameroon has \nexperienced difficulties with terrorism and political instability. Under these circumstances, \nApplicant\u2019s relationship to his mother, a citizen and resident of Cameroon, triggers the \napplication of AG \u00b6 7(a) \u201ccontact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in \na foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d  \n \n \nThe politically unstable part of Cameroon where terrorism is prevalent is a rural area \nthat is far from where Applicant\u2019s mother lives. Moreover, Applicant has spent nearly his \nentire life in the United States, immigrating here when he was 11 years old to live with his \nuncle. Applicant was educated in the United States, and all of his assets are here. Under \nthese circumstances, AG \u00b6 8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the \nindividual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States, that the individual can be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest,\u201d applies. I conclude Applicant \nhas mitigated the foreign influence security concern. \n \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology \n \n  \nThe security concerns generated by this guideline are set forth in AG \u00b6 39, as \nfollows:  \n \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations pertaining \nto information technology systems may raise concerns about an individual\u2019s \nreliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the willingness or ability to \nproperly protect sensitive systems, notebooks, and information. Information \ntechnology includes . . . any component, whether integrated into a larger \nsystem or not, such as hardware, software, or firmware, used to facilitate \nthese transactions. \n\n7 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s multiple violations of his employer\u2019s Internet use policy triggers the \napplication of the following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 40: \n \n(e) unauthorized use of any information technology system; and \n \n(f) introduction . . . of hardware, firmware, software, or media to or from any \ninformation technology system when prohibited by rules, procedures, \nguidelines, or regulations, or when otherwise not authorized. \n \n \nApplicant has had no additional episodes of misuse of information technology for \nmore than five years. He has informed all of his subsequent employers of the details \nregarding his termination, completed multiple trainings, and is highly respected on his \ncurrent job. These favorable facts raise the issue of whether the mitigating condition set \nforth in AG \u00b6 41(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d applies. \n \n \nApplicant contends that he had permission to visit hacking-related websites, and was \naccessing them either as part of his job, or in an effort to further his cyber-security studies. \nThis contention raises the issue of whether the mitigating condition set forth in AG \u00b6 41(d), \n\u201cthe misuse was due to  . . . unclear instruction,\u201d applies. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s violations of his ex-employer\u2019s Internet use policy were extremely \nserious, as they involved visiting websites containing network hacking and password-\ncracking tutorials. These violations were particularly egregious because Applicant was \nresponsible, in part, with developing malware defenses for his employer. Under these \ncircumstances, his behavior continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment, and AG \u00b6 41(a) is inapplicable. Given the unusually high volume of visits to \ninappropriate hacking websites, and in light of evidence that Applicant attempted to obscure \nsome of his illicit Internet activity, AG \u00b6 41(d) also does not apply.  Efforts to conceal his \nconduct show consciousness of guilt, that is, he was aware that his Internet activity was not \npermitted. In sum, there is limited evidence of mitigation, but in light of the nature and \nseriousness of the violations, it is insufficient to fully mitigate the security concerns. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) Since Guideline E concerns only a cross-allegation, security \nconcerns under Guideline E are essentially duplicative and separate analysis is \nunnecessary. Applicant\u2019s conduct is nevertheless disqualifying and unmitigated under this \nguideline for the same reasons as discussed above under Guideline M. \n  \n \n \n \n\n8 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the whole-person factors in my consideration of the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions set forth under Guidelines B, M, and E. They do not warrant a \nfavorable conclusion.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline M:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n` \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline B  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_____________________ \nMarc E. Curry \n Administrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 50 years old. He was born and lived in Iraq until age 22. He and his wife married in 2003, and they have three children, ages 15, 14, and 10. His wife and children were also born in Iraq. He and his family came to the United States in 2010 under a special refugee visa program, based on his work, starting in October 2004, as a linguist/interpreter for a company supporting U.S and coalition force training programs in Iraq. They all became permanent U.S. residents in 2011, and became naturalized U.S. citizens in August 2015. (GE 1; GE 2; GE 3; AE B; Tr. 26-40.)

Based upon a review of the record as a \nwhole, national security eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nHistory of Case \nOn May 8, 2017, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On November 14, 2018, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). The action was \ntaken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines for national security eligibility effective within \nthe DoD on June 8, 2017. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 17, 2018 (Answer). He \nadmitted the SOR allegations, with some explanations, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned \nthe case to me on February 7, 2019. After some delays requested by Applicant, due to \nhis overseas employment obligations, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on August 7, \n2019, setting the hearing for September 10, 2019. On that date, Department Counsel \noffered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3 into evidence. Applicant testified and \noffered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through C into evidence. All exhibits were admitted \nwithout objection. I took administrative notice of the facts concerning Iraq that are set forth \non pages 2 through 6 of the Government\u2019s Request for Administrative Notice, which is \nmarked Hearing Exhibit (HE) II and included in the record.1 DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on September 18, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 50 years old. He was born and lived in Iraq until age 22. He and his \nwife married in 2003, and they have three children, ages 15, 14, and 10. His wife and \nchildren were also born in Iraq. He and his family came to the United States in 2010 under \na special refugee visa program, based on his work, starting in October 2004, as a \nlinguist/interpreter for a company supporting U.S and coalition force training programs in \nIraq. They all became permanent U.S. residents in 2011, and became naturalized U.S. \ncitizens in August 2015. (GE 1; GE 2; GE 3; AE B; Tr. 26-40.) \n \n \nApplicant earned an associate\u2019s degree in Iraq in 1990, and certification as an \nHVAC technician in 2015 from a college in the United States. From 2010 until 2017 he \nworked full-time in several security guard, maintenance, and HVAC technician jobs, \nexcept for a brief part-time employment in 2015 and 2016. He has been employed since \nMay 2017 by a defense contractor as a contract linguist, to serve overseas in direct \nsupport of U.S. Army units. He renounced his Iraqi citizenship and applied for a security \nclearance in connection with that position. His wife is currently a preschool/daycare \nteacher, and his children attend local schools, in the United States. (GE 1; GE 2; GE 3; \nTr. 26-40.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother and father are deceased. He has seven brothers and four \nsisters, who are all citizens and residents of Iraq. His wife\u2019s parents and siblings are also \nIraqi citizens and residents. Several of these relatives are employed by civilian \ngovernment agencies, but none have any connection to Iraqi defense or intelligence \nagencies. Except for one brother, Applicant has intentionally avoided contact with his \nfamily members in Iraq for many years, as further discussed below. He also has numerous \nIraqi aunts, uncles, and cousins who reside there. Two of his cousins, with whom he has \nhad no contact for years, served and retired from careers in the Iraqi armed forces. (GE \n2; GE 3; AE C; Tr. 35, 41-49, 53-65.) \n \n \n                                            \n1 HE I is the Government Exhibit Index.  \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \nAlthough Applicant obtained regular employment in the United States, he did not \nearn enough money to satisfactorily house and support his family until he obtained his \npresent job after returning from a 20-day visit to Iraq in May 2017. He explained, in his \nJune 2017 counterintelligence-screening interview, that his wife and children had returned \nto reside in Iraq in March 2017 because his wife was depressed and was having a hard \ntime adjusting to life in the U.S. They rented a home in Iraq so she could live near her \nfamily. Applicant wired them about $500 per month for living expenses, while he lived in \na homeless shelter and sought better work in the United States. In September 2017, \nApplicant\u2019s wife and children moved back to the United States. They have repaid their \ntemporarily delinquent debts from that period, and purchased a house with the greatly \nincreased income he earns working for the defense contractor. (GE 1; GE 2; GE 3; Tr. \n35-38, 46-50.) \n  \n \nDuring his June 6, 2017 interview with an investigator from the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM), Applicant explained that he:  \n \nhas not maintained any contact with his various brothers and sisters, except \nwith his brother [A], whom [he] will speak with daily to monthly on the phone. \n[He] is not close to his brothers and sisters as he does not trust that they \ncould reasonably keep private that he lives in the US and is considering \nworking as a contractor for the US Army in Iraq. He fears for his wife and \nchildren\u2019s safety if this information stumbled into the wrong hands, like that \nof an anti-US or terrorist group. [He] clarified none of his family members \nare involved in any anti-US activities, but fears they could accidentally share \nwhat [he] does and as a result that information could trickle to other people \nand ultimately end up putting [him] in danger. [He] only trusts that his brother \n[A] would keep this information absolutely private, hence why they still have \ncommunication.  \n \n \nApplicant testified during his hearing that his family members know that he lives in \nthe United States, but only his brother [A] knows that he \u201cis working for Americans\u201d in \nIraq. He further explained: \n \nNobody knows other than him, so all my brothers I did not tell them I\u2019m \nworking for Americans. . . . They are all in danger, you know, because \nthey\u2019ve been in danger when I was working here. Now, as long as I\u2019m \noutside, I don\u2019t see them, so . . . they are safe. . . . [I have not been in touch \nwith them at all since 2010], the main reason, because I work with the \nAmericans, so I cut all my relationship for their safety. I used to see them \nevery day but . . . [Brother A], he got to take the risk because I got to have \ncontact with someone. (Tr. 57-62.) \n \n \nDescribing his and his family\u2019s experience moving to the United States he testified, \n\u201cI\u2019m feeling American. So I\u2019m - - this is my country. So even my kids, my family, they \nstarted to feel American. So that\u2019s it. We kind of lost connection with the Iraqi citizenship; \nnow everything became - - we start to integrate into American society.\u201d He said that he \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nwould continue to be loyal to America, that he no longer considers Iraq to be his home \ncountry. He said that a friend and coworker had been shot and died a month earlier while \nserving as a linguist in Iraq, but he does not care about the danger associated with his \nwork there because he feels he is doing the right thing. (Tr. 51-52.) \n \n \nApplicant provided character reference letters and a certificate of commendation \nrelated to his work in Iraq as a linguist/interpreter from 2004 to 2008. He explained that \nhe did not obtain any evaluations or letters from his more recent employment because he \nonly worked with people for a few months at a time so he could not ask them for a letter. \n(AE A; Tr. 65-66.)   \n   \nI have taken administrative notice of facts contained in U.S. Government \npublications concerning the state of Iraq, as outlined on pages 2 through 6 of HE II, \nincluding the following: Iraq faces many challenges fueled by sectarian and ethnic \ndivisions. Numerous terrorist groups and anti-U.S. sectarian militias are active throughout \nIraq. The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) no longer controls a portion of the country\u2019s \nterritory, but remains active in both countries and controls some areas of Syria along the \nborder. Threats of terrorist attacks, kidnapping, and violence are high from ISIS and \nIranian-backed Shia militias. The Department of State has advised U.S. citizens not to \ntravel to Iraq, and U.S. Government personnel assigned to duty in Iraq are required to \nlive and work under strict security guidelines. Additionally, human-rights-related problems \nincluding kidnappings for ransom, disappearances, torture, and attacks against civilians \nhave been noted.    \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and \nmitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(b) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility be resolved in favor of the national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \n\n \n \n \n \n5\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 requires that the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who applies for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants eligibility \nfor access to classified information or assignment in sensitive duties. Decisions include, \nby necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a \ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk \nof compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides, \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to \nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, \nSection 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation).  \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concerns regarding foreign influence:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nAG \u00b6 7 sets out conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Two of them are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;2 and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \n \nApplicant has normal and commendable familial connections with most of his 11 \nsiblings, and numerous more-distant family members, who are residents and citizens of \nIraq. Out of laudable and ongoing concern for their welfare, and hoping to minimize the \nthreat of reprisals against them for his activities, he has minimized contact and \ncommunications with all but one of these relatives since he first chose to actively support \nU.S. interests and operations in Iraq. These relationships, both objectively and in his \nmind, create a heightened risk of foreign pressure, coercion, and exploitation because \nterrorists, insurgents, or anti-U.S. militia personnel in Iraq may threaten Applicant or his \nfamily, as they seek intelligence or engage in behaviors that are hostile to U.S. interests. \nApplicant has not been personally attacked as a result of his service with U.S. and \ncoalition forces in Iraq, but expressed his recognition of the ongoing threat. Applicant\u2019s \nrelationship with his relatives also creates a potential conflict of interest between his \nobligation to protect sensitive information or technology and his desire to help family \nmembers living in Iraq should they be threatened. The evidence is sufficient to raise these \ndisqualifying conditions, shifting the burden to Applicant to prove mitigation.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns. \nThose with potential application in mitigating the security concerns in this case are: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States;  \n \n                                            \n2 The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, \ndisqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an applicant \nhas contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and \ncould potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. \nBd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \n \nApplicant did not establish that it is unlikely that he could be placed in a position of \nhaving to choose between the interests of a foreign individual or government and those \nof the United States as a consequence of his and his wife\u2019s many longstanding and \ncommendable relationships with their family members in Iraq. Those connections create \ncontinuing and significant potential for conflict of interest and risk of coercion, exploitation, \nmanipulation, or pressure. Applicant has demonstrated courage and compliance with U.S. \nsecurity procedures in the face of significant potential personal risk arising from his \ncollaboration with U.S. forces in Iraq. Under Appeal Board precedent, this weighs \nfavorably in assessing his likelihood of resolving future conflicts in favor of U.S. interests. \nHowever, his other connections to the United States are relatively minimal and recent. \nAccordingly, Applicant failed to establish sufficient mitigation with respect to those \nrelationships under AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), (b), or (c). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. The Guideline B security concerns do not \narise from any questionable conduct by Applicant, but rather circumstances that are \nnormal results of his commendable family relationships. Applicant is a mature person, \nwho gained U.S. residence as a refugee after providing linguist services to U.S. and \ncoalition forces in Iraq. He has been a naturalized citizen since 2015, and began working \nagain as a linguist for U.S. Army forces in Iraq in 2018. His spouse and children are also \nnaturalized U.S. citizens, who also retain their Iraqi citizenship. There is no evidence or \nallegation that he has ever taken any action that could cause potential harm to the United \nStates. However, his ongoing concern for, and relationships with, his numerous family \nmembers, who are citizens and residents of Iraq, create significant and ongoing potential \nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole-person, I conclude Applicant did not meet his \nburden to mitigate the foreign influence security concerns raised by the facts of this case. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

Based on this \nevidence, the Government alleged that Applicant falsified his March 2012 clearance \napplication (GE 1). \nNevertheless, Applicant testified (Tr. 27-29; 37-40) that he had used marijuana \nafter the marathon in July 2012, not in July 2008, when he did not run that marathon. The \nfriend with whom he used the marijuana provided the particulars of that use, including the \nfact that it occurred in July 2012, not July 2008 (AE B). She was the only witness to \nApplicant=s marijuana use on that occasion. She reports having been interviewed as part \nof Applicant=s 2018 background investigation. \nApplicant=s Answer to the SOR acknowledges the poor judgment demonstrated by \nhis past illegal marijuana use but provides substantial documentation that this illegal drug \nuse was an aberration in his life. He has an excellent work history (Answer, Exhibit B, C), \nand has received significant financial recognition from his employer (Answer, Exhibit A). \nHis coworkers consider him honest and trustworthy and recommend him for his \nclearance. They are aware of the SOR allegations (Answer, Exhibit D). Another long-time \nfriend from his running club similarly recommends him for his clearance (AE A). He has \nexecuted a statement providing for immediate revocation of his clearance for future drug \nuse, as contemplated by the Directive (Answer, Exhibit E; AE C). In February 2019, he \nhad a favorable drug screening by a certified substance abuse counselor, albeit by live \nvideo feed (Answer, Exhibit F). He is a fitness devotee (Answer, Exhibit G). \nApplicant acknowledged that his poor decisions reflect adversely on his judgment, \nbut attributes them to spur-of-the-moment decisions made in one instance after a \nstrenuous physical accomplishment, and in the other after a family outing involving \nalcohol. He notes that continued drug use is inconsistent with his fitness lifestyle, and he \nwill have little contact with his soon-to-be-ex-wife=s family. \nPolicies \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe AG list factors to evaluate a person=s suitability for access to classified \ninformation. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and mitigating conditions \nunder each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented. Each decision must \nalso show a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the factors listed in AG & \n2(d). The applicability of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself, conclusive. \nHowever, specific guidelines should be followed when a case can be measured against \nthem, as they are policy guidance governing the grant or denial of a clearance. \nConsidering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant adjudicative \nguidelines are Guideline H (Drug Involvement), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant=s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, the \nburden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government=s case. \nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden \nof persuasion. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the required judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. \nThe Aclearly consistent with the national interest@ standard compels deciding any \nreasonable doubt about an Applicant=s suitability for access in favor of the Government.3 \nAnalysis \nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline H, by \ndemonstrating Applicant=s illegal marijuana abuse in July 2012 and November 2015, but \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns.4 Applicant used marijuana twice after having \nbeen given access to classified information. However, there is no indication of a \nsubstance abuse problem, and he has been abstinent from any illegal drug use for over \nthree years. \nDrug involvement mitigating conditions give significant support to Applicant. His \nillegal drug abuse was not recent, clearly infrequent, and under circumstances unlikely to \nrecur.5 He has not used marijuana in over three years. Moreover, he has executed the \n3See, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n4&25(a) any substance misuse; (f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; \n5&26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment [Emphasis supplied]; \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n        \n                                                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nstatement of intent regarding future illegal drug use as contemplated by the Directive.6\nUnder the circumstances, I conclude Applicant is unlikely to abuse illegal drugs in the \nfuture. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline H for Applicant. \nThe Government failed to establish a case for disqualification under Guideline E. \nThe conduct complained ofCmarijuana use on two occasions while having access to \nclassified informationCis fully cognizable as drug abuse under Guideline H. The \ndisqualifying condition cited by the Government, &16 (d), is not satisfied. 7 The \nGovernment did not establish that Applicant falsified his March 2012 clearance \napplication because the actual date of the marijuana use was July 2012, and \nconsequently after he executed the clearance application. Accordingly, I resolve \nGuideline E for Applicant. \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1. Guideline H:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs a-b:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2. Guideline E:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs a-c:  \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nUnder the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nClearance granted. \n6&26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance misuse, provides evidence \nof actions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the \nenvironment where drugs were used; and (3) a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for \nrevocation of national security eligibility; \n7&16 (d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not \nbe sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable, judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of \ncandor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This included but is not limited to consideration \nof: . . .

Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn July 5, 2016, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit (GE) 1) \nOn December 20, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Executive Order \n(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, \n1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nestablishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AGs), effective June 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2)  \n \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n\n \n2 \n                                         \n \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guidelines H, G, and E. \n(HE 2) On January 22, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. \n(HE 3)    \n \nOn December 4, 2019, the case was assigned to me. On December 20, 2019, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the \nhearing for January 15, 2020. The hearing was held as scheduled using video \nteleconference.  \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered eight exhibits; Applicant offered \nnine exhibits; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into \nevidence. (Transcript (Tr.) 16-20; GE 1-8; AE A-I) On January 24, 2020, DOHA received \na transcript of the hearing.  \n \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits and transcript.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 2.a, \nand 2.b. (HE 3) He denied the other SOR allegations. He also provided extenuating and \nmitigating information. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 34-year-old avionics equipment specialist working for a defense \ncontractor for the past two years. (Tr. 7, 9; GE 1) In 2003, he graduated from high school, \nand he completed three years of college. (Tr. 7-8) He served in the Air Force from 2004 \nto 2008.

(Tr. 8) His Air Force specialty was nuclear cruise \nmissile maintenance technician. (Tr. 9) For most of his Air Force service, he had a top \nsecret clearance with access to sensitive compartmented information (TS/SCI). (Tr. 9) He \nwas married from 2006 to 2012, and he does not have any children. (Tr. 8) \n \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that from about 2003 until at least October 2014, Applicant used \nmarijuana with varying frequency. SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that from about March 2005 until \nJune 2008, Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency while holding a security \nclearance. SOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that from about March 2012 until at least October 2014, \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency while employed in a position of public \ntrust. Applicant denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c explaining that his marijuana use was \nlimited to June and July 2014. (HE 2) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges that from about June 2014 to July 2014, Applicant purchased \nmarijuana with varying frequency. SOR \u00b6 1.e alleges that in about May 2014, Applicant \nwas arrested and charged with possession of drug paraphernalia and possession of \nmarijuana while operating a motor vehicle. (GE 8 at 1) In May 2014, Applicant had a drink \nof alcohol before he started driving home. (Tr. 24) A police officer said he crossed the \n\n \n3 \n                                         \n \ncenter line. (Tr. 24) He also had an open container of alcohol in his vehicle. (Tr. 24) The \npolice officer searched Applicant and found marijuana in his possession. (Tr. 24; GE 1 at \n33) He also had a small glass marijuana pipe in his vehicle. (Tr. 25) He was not charged \nwith an alcohol offense. When he went to court, he received deferred adjudication for one \nyear, and his record was expunged after one year. (GE 1) Applicant said he used \nmarijuana three or four times in May 2014. (Tr. 23, 25-26) He insisted he did not use \nmarijuana before May 2014. (Tr. 26) He clarified that he used marijuana 10 to 15 times \nor once or twice a week from May through July 2014. (Tr. 35) He held a public trust \nposition when he possessed marijuana. (GE 1 at 33) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges that in about October 2014, Applicant was diagnosed by a \nlicensed addiction counselor (LAC) with a condition called Cannabis Abuse. The court \nadjudicating Applicant\u2019s July 2014 arrest required him to undergo a substance-abuse \nevaluation. (Tr. 30) On October 9, 2014, an LAC interviewed Applicant. (Tr. 30) According \nto the LAC\u2019s report (also dated October 9, 2014), Applicant told the evaluator:  \n \n[Applicant] reports first drinking at age 17 and smoked pot for the first time \nat age 18. States he got intoxicated for the first time at age 17 and has been \na regular user since age 18. States he drank three times and smoked pot \nonce in the last 30 days. States pot is his drug of choice, a bowl once or \ntwice a day . . . . States the last time he drank was 10-04-14, last time he \nsmoked pot was about a week and a half ago . . . . States he spends $50.00 \nto $100.00 a month on using . . . . States . . . pot relaxes him. Denies being \npreoccupied with the thought of using. [Applicant] states his using isn\u2019t a \nproblem . . . . States he has four close friends and they all use . . . . States \nhis mother and father are chemically dependent, they live in [a state where \nmarijuana] is legal. (GE 5)   \n \nThe LAC indicated in Axis I: 305.20 (Cannabis Abuse); and 305.00 (Alcohol \nAbuse). (GE 5) The LAC concluded Applicant was \u201cnot chemically dependent,\u201d and he \nshould receive a 16-hour education program. (GE 5) \n \nApplicant strenuously disputes the LAC\u2019s description of his marijuana use; \nhowever, he did not give a reason the evaluator would intentionally lie about the duration \nand frequency of Applicant\u2019s marijuana use. (Tr. 33) Applicant suggested the evaluator \n\u201cgot [his] notes mixed up.\u201d (Tr. 33) He said the LAC may have confused his description of \nhis alcohol use with his description of his marijuana use. (Tr. 37) Applicant called the LAC \nand confronted him with his concerns about the accuracy of his notes. (Tr. 33) Applicant \nsaid the LAC mentioned his inability to remember what Applicant said during the \ninterview; however, the LAC refused to disavow the accuracy of his notes. (Tr. 33) \nApplicant provided a letter from the LAC dated March 28, 2019, which states as follows: \n \n[Applicant] called me on 03-19-19, concerning the alcohol and drug \nevaluation I did on him on 10-09-14. He was questioning the information in \nthe evaluation of when he first used marijuana. At the time of the evaluation \nhe reported first using at age 18. He went on stating in the report that he \nused pot in the thirty days prior to 10-09-14, but during the call he assured \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \nme that he didn\u2019t use before 2014. When talking to [Applicant] on 03-19-19, \nhe said he didn\u2019t know if he reported that information inaccurately or if I \nmade a mistake in my documentation. I have no way of knowing if this is \naccurate other than looking at the information I received at the time of the \nevaluation. If he feels this is inaccurate, I have no other recommendation \nfor him other than to get another evaluation. (AE C)  \n \nApplicant said that he could not have used marijuana when he was on active duty \nin the Air Force and held a TS/SCI-level clearance because of the frequency of the Air \nForce\u2019s urinalysis testing of those holding TS/SCI-level clearances with access to nuclear \nmaterials. (Tr. 40) He insisted the LAC\u2019s notes were not accurate. (Tr. 40-41) \n \nThere is no evidence Applicant tested positive on a urinalysis test for use of illegal \ndrugs. Applicant denied that he currently possesses any marijuana or drug paraphernalia. \n(Tr. 38) He has friends that use marijuana; however, they do not use marijuana in his \npresence. (Tr. 39)     \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant was arrested in about July 2014, and charged \nwith operating a vehicle while intoxicated. Applicant was sad or depressed about his \nsituation after his marijuana-related arrest in May 2014, and he made a bad decision to \ndrink excessive amounts of alcohol. (Tr. 26-27) In July 2014, he drank eight or nine beers \nover a six-hour period. (Tr. 39) The police stopped Applicant\u2019s vehicle for improper lane \nchange and asked him if he drank any alcohol that day. (Tr. 26, 39; GE 3; GE 6) Applicant \ndenied that he drank any alcohol to the police officer because he did not want to go to \njail. (Tr. 39; GE 6) Applicant subsequently told the police officer that he only had two or \nthree drinks. (Tr. 39; GE 6) The preliminary blood alcohol test indicated .129 BAC. (GE 6 \nat 2) A police officer found an open container of beer in Applicant\u2019s vehicle. (GE 6 at 1) \nUpon arrival at jail, the police found marijuana on Applicant\u2019s person. (GE 6 at 1-2) Two \nbreath tests were administered at the jail with results of .10 and .11 BACs. (GE 6 at 2) \n \nApplicant was not charged with possession of the marijuana found on his person \nin July 2014. (GE 3) Applicant pleaded guilty to operating while impaired (OWI), and he \nwas sentenced to six months of probation, to pay a fine, to have a substance-abuse \nassessment, and to complete a 16-hour alcohol-treatment class. (GE 1 at 34; GE 6; GE \n7) Applicant did not inform his supervisor or security officer of his arrests in May and July \n2014. (Tr. 28) He said he did not inform the government of his arrests because of \u201cfear of \nlosing my job.\u201d (GE 4 at 18) About a year after his second arrest, the government \nconducted a background check of contractor employees because of a security breach \nunrelated to Applicant\u2019s conduct, and his employer discovered his two arrests in 2014. \n(Tr. 29) Applicant\u2019s contractor employer fired him. (Tr. 29) \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges that Applicant was diagnosed by an LAC with a condition called \nAlcohol Abuse. Applicant consumed alcohol since the age of 17. (Tr. 36) In 2014, he was \ndrinking alcohol four or five times a week. (Tr. 36)  \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s September 17, 2018 response to DOHA interrogatories, he said he \nconsumed two to three drinks, two to three times a month. (GE 4 at 19) The most recent \ntime he was intoxicated was on September 15, 2018. (GE 4 at 20) Applicant stated at his \nhearing that he has dramatically reduced his alcohol consumption to about once every \ntwo months. (Tr. 37) There is no evidence of alcohol-related incidents involving the police \nor the courts after July 2014. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nThe SOR cross-alleges in \u00b6 3.a the same conduct as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nthrough 1.e above. The SOR alleges that Applicant falsified material facts as follows: \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.b alleges Applicant stated that on or about July 5, 2016, he completed an \nSCA which asked in Section 23 about whether he used any controlled substance in the \nprevious seven years. Applicant responded, yes, and said \u201cI had never smoked marijuana \nbefore June 2014. I was introduced to it during a rough period in my life. I only smoked it \na handful of times, and stopped all together in July of 2014.\u201d (GE 1 at 32) He said he \n\u201c[e]xperimented with it, only smoked 10-15 times between the beginning of June 2014 \nand the end of July 2014.\u201d (Id.) After his arrests for possession of marijuana and OWI, he \nsaid he \u201cdecided it was time to get my life back on track. I was forced to resign my position \ndue to the charge. My experimental use of marijuana did damage to my life as a whole, \nand I will never use it again.\u201d (Id.)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.c alleges Applicant stated that on or about October 19, 2017, during an \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject interview (PSI), he used \nmarijuana 10 to 15 times between June and July 2014. (GE 3 at 4) He specifically denied \nany marijuana use prior to June 2014. (GE 3 at 4) He said he purchased marijuana once, \nand the other times he received marijuana without purchasing it. (GE 3 at 4-5) \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.d alleges Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories on or about \nSeptember 17, 2018, and he denied that he used marijuana except for 10 to 15 times \nbetween June and July 2014. (GE 4) He said in his DOHA interrogatories that from April \n2014 to July 2014, he used marijuana two to four times a week. (GE 4 at 9) He also said \nhe \u201cbought small amounts of marijuana for personal use from April 2014 \u2013 July 2014.\u201d \n(GE 4 at 9) He concluded, \u201cI only started smoking marijuana well after I was divorced. I \nsmoked a handful of times over a few month period in 2014. I stopped because marijuana \nwas not the way to deal with my problems.\u201d (GE 4 at 11)  \n \nApplicant failed to disclose or admit the full duration and frequency of his marijuana \nuse as indicated in the October 9, 2014 substance-abuse evaluation in the drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse section of this decision, supra. Applicant told the LAC \non October 9, 2014, he used marijuana \u201conce in the last 30 days\u201d or about 10 days before \nhis interview. (GE 5) \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nSix coworkers, colleagues, and/or friends as well as his former spouse provided \ncharacter statements supporting reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s access to classified \ninformation. (AE B; AE D-I) His character evidence includes statements from persons who \nare honorably retired after many years of military service, senior noncommissioned \nofficers on active duty, and highly trained technicians and managers. The general sense \nof their statements is that Applicant is diligent, knowledgeable, intelligent, meticulous, \nprofessional, generous, loyal, honest, a good leader, and trustworthy. (AE B; AE D-I) His \nhard \nwork \nand \nprofessionalism \nmade \nsubstantial \ncontributions \nto \nmission \naccomplishment. (AE B; AE D-I) None of his character statements described any abuse \nof alcohol or use of illegal drugs by Applicant. (AE B-AE D-I) There is no evidence of \nsecurity violations, improper disclosure of classified information, or that Applicant \ncompromised national security.  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \u201cThe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of \nthe Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Direct or objective evidence of nexus \nis not required.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)).  \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \nAnalysis \n \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 24 provides the security concern arising from drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse stating: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises questions \nabout a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case including: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above definition)\u201d; \u201c(c) \nillegal possession of a controlled substance. . .\u201d; \u201c(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical \nor mental health professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or \nlicensed clinical social worker) of substance use disorder\u201d; and \u201c(f) any illegal drug use \nwhile granted access to classified information or holding a sensitive position.\u201d \n \nOn October 9, 2014, the LAC addressed Applicant\u2019s history of marijuana use as \nfollows: (1) Applicant first used marijuana when he was 18 years old; (2) he used \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \nmarijuana in the previous 30 days, more specifically, about 10 days previously; (3) \nmarijuana is Applicant\u2019s drug of choice; (4) he used marijuana regularly; and (5) he has \nfour close friends who use marijuana. He diagnosed Applicant with Cannabis Abuse. \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana in 2014 occurred while he held a public trust position. He \npurchased marijuana on multiple occasions in June and July 2014. In May 2014, he was \narrested for possession of marijuana.  \n \nAlthough the Federal Rules of Evidence (Fed. R. Evid.) are not directly applicable \nto security clearance hearings, I note that Fed. R. Evid. Rule 801(d)(2)(A) governs \nadmissions against interest, and Rule 803(4) governs admissibility of statements made \nto obtain medical treatment. Such statements are more probative because of the \ncircumstances when they were made. Statements to healthcare providers are more \nreliable and probative because a person is expected to be candid when seeking medical \ntreatment. See generally White v. Ill., 502 U.S. 346 (1992) (discussing admissibility of \nevidence provided by victims during medical treatment). The LAC knew he was providing \na report that might be used in court and possibly used to support substance-abuse \ncounseling, and therefore, there is an expectation that he would endeavor to be accurate. \nI found the LAC\u2019s October 9, 2014 report that Applicant said he used marijuana \u201conce in \nthe last 30 days\u201d or about 10 days before his October 9, 2014 interview to be more \ncredible than Applicant\u2019s claims of no marijuana use after July 2014.  \n \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are \ncontained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c). Marijuana is a Schedule (Sch.) I controlled substances. \nSee Drug Enforcement Administration listing at http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/ \n21cfr/cfr/1308/1308 11.htm. See also Gonzales v. Raish, 545 U.S. 1 (2005) (discussing \nplacement of marijuana on Schedule I). \n \nI have credited Applicant with refuting SOR \u00b6 1.b. The LAC\u2019s October 9, 2014 report \nindicated Applicant first used marijuana when he was 18 years old, and he used marijuana  \n\u201conce in the last 30 days\u201d or about 10 days before his interview. (GE 5) However, the LAC \ndid not specifically describe marijuana use from March 2005 to June 2008. Most likely the \nLAC was focusing on Applicant\u2019s recent marijuana use in which he gave details showing \nit was regular. Applicant denied marijuana use during the period March 2005 to June 2008 \nwhile he had access to TS/SCI and was subject to frequent urinalysis tests. There is no \nevidence he tested positive on a urinalysis test for use of illegal drugs while he was on \nactive duty. I conclude SOR \u00b6 1.b is refuted.   \n \nAG \u00b6 26 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply; however, Applicant provided some \nimportant mitigating information. He completed a 16-hour alcohol-related class. He ended \nhis marijuana abuse in 2014. Marijuana users do not use marijuana in his presence.  \n \nThe evidence against mitigation is more persuasive. Applicant\u2019s marijuana abuse \noccurred while he held a public trust position. The discovery of his marijuana abuse \noccurred as the result of an arrest. He was not honest about the duration and frequency \nof his marijuana abuse in his security documents. See Guideline E discussion, infra. The \nrisk that Applicant may abuse marijuana in the future cannot be ruled out. Guideline H \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated. \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \n \nAG \u00b6 21 articulates the Government\u2019s concern about alcohol consumption, \n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or \n\n \n10 \n                                         \n \nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d \n  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 22 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case including: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder;  \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), 22(c), and 22(d) apply. Applicant had one alcohol-related driving \nincidents involving the police and/or the courts in 2014 alleged in the SOR. For the July \n2014 offense, the preliminary blood alcohol test indicated .129 BAC. A police officer found \nan open container of beer in Applicant\u2019s vehicle. Two breath tests were administered at \nthe jail with results of .10 and .11 BACs. \u201cBinge drinking is the most common pattern of \nexcessive alcohol use in the United States.\u201d See the Center for Disease Control website, \n(stating \u201cThe National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines binge drinking \nas a pattern of drinking that brings a person\u2019s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 0.08 \ngrams percent or above. This typically happens when men consume 5 or more drinks, \nand \nwhen \nwomen \nconsume \n4 \nor \nmore \ndrinks, \nin \nabout \n2 \nhours.\u201d), \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/binge-drinking.htm. There are other definitions \nof \u201cbinge alcohol consumption\u201d that involve different alcohol-consumption amounts and \npatterns. He engaged in binge-alcohol consumption to the extent of impaired judgment. \nThe LAC indicated in Axis I: 305.00 (Alcohol Abuse).  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 23 details conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n \n\n \n11 \n                                         \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n  \n \nSecurity clearance cases are difficult to compare, especially under Guideline G, \nbecause the facts, degree, and timing of the alcohol abuse and rehabilitation show many \ndifferent permutations. The DOHA Appeal Board has determined in cases of substantial \nalcohol abuse that AG \u00b6 23(b) did not mitigate security concerns unless there was a fairly \nlengthy period of abstaining from alcohol consumption or responsible alcohol \nconsumption. See ISCR Case No. 06-17541 at 3-5 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2008); ISCR Case \nNo. 06-08708 at 5-7 (App. Bd. Dec. 17, 2007); ISCR Case No. 04-10799 at 2-4 (App. Bd. \nNov. 9, 2007). See also ISCR Case No. 08-04232 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2009) (affirming denial \nof security clearance for Applicant with alcohol-related criminal offenses for six years prior \nto hearing). For example, in ISCR Case No. 05-16753 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2007) the \nAppeal Board reversed the administrative judge\u2019s grant of a clearance and noted, \u201cThat \nApplicant continued to drink even after his second alcohol-related arrest vitiates the \nJudge\u2019s application of MC 3.\u201d   \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-10019 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2007) the Appeal Board \nreversed an administrative judge\u2019s grant of a clearance to an applicant (AB) where AB \nhad several alcohol-related legal problems. However, AB\u2019s most recent DUI was in 2000, \nsix years before an administrative judge decided AB\u2019s case. AB had reduced his alcohol \nconsumption, but still drank alcohol to intoxication, and sometimes drank alcohol (not to \nintoxication) before driving. The Appeal Board determined that AB\u2019s continued alcohol \nconsumption was not responsible, and the grant of AB\u2019s clearance was arbitrary and \ncapricious. See also ISCR Case No. 04-12916 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2007) (reversing \ngrant of a security clearance where most recent alcohol-related incident was three years \nbefore hearing because of overall history of alcohol consumption). \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 18-02526 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2019) the applicant \u201cdrove vehicles \non three occasions while impaired by alcohol between 2000 and 2017.\u201d Id. at 4. The \napplicant participated in alcohol-related therapy and counseling, and he abstained from \nalcohol consumption for two years. Id. at 2. The Appeal Board emphasized the lack of an \nestablished benchmark period of abstinence from alcohol consumption stating: \n \nAs we have previously stated, the Directive does not specify how much time \nmust pass to mitigate the various types of misconduct identified in the \nadjudicative guidelines. Contrary to the Judge\u2019s conclusion, the Board has \nrepeatedly declined to establish a \u201cbenchmark\u201d or \u201cbright-line\u201d rule for \nevaluating the recency of misconduct. The extent to which security \nconcerns have become mitigated through the passage of time is a question \nthat must be resolved based on the evidence as a whole.  \n\n \n12 \n                                         \n \n \nId. at 3 (citing ISCR Case No. 18-01926 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 20, 2019) (reversing grant \nof security clearance for applicant with three alcohol-related driving incidents with most \nrecent occurring in 2017)). \n \nI have carefully considered the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence on alcohol \nconsumption and Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol consumption. He reduced his alcohol \nconsumption. In 2014, he completed a 16-hour alcohol awareness course, and he did not \nengage in any alcohol-related incidents involving the police and courts after 2014. Enough \ntime has elapsed since July 2014, when he was most recently involved with the police in \nan alcohol-related incident, to enable a reasonable predictive judgment that his \nmaladaptive use of alcohol is safely in the past. Alcohol consumption security concerns \nare mitigated. \n  \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 lists \u201cconditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying includ[ing]\u201d: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n\n \n13 \n                                         \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative; \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: . . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty \nor rule violations; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \nThe October 9, 2014 LAC report said Applicant first used marijuana when he was \n18 years old, and he last used marijuana around September 2014. His use of marijuana \nin 2014 occurred while he held a public trust position. He purchased marijuana on multiple \noccasions in June to July 2014. In May 2014, he was arrested for possession of \nmarijuana. I found the LAC report of extensive marijuana use to be more credible than \nApplicant\u2019s claims of more limited marijuana use in his July 5, 2016 SCA, October 19, \n2017 OPM PSI, and September 17, 2018 responses to DOHA interrogatories. I find his \nattempts to falsely minimize the duration and frequency of his marijuana use to be \nintentionally deceptive.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s pattern of marijuana use and his lying about the extent of his marijuana \npossession and use show questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, and \nunwillingness to comply with rules. Such conduct adversely affects his professional and \ncommunity standing. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a), 16(b), and 16(e) are established. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and \n16(d) are not established because his marijuana possession and use are covered under \nGuideline H, and marijuana involvement is sufficient for an adverse determination without \nrecourse to Guideline E. \n\n \n14 \n                                         \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR does not allege that he lied to the police about not consuming \nalcohol the day the police stopped his vehicle in July 2014, or that he failed to disclose \nhis arrests in 2014 to the government or security officials because he was worried about \nbeing fired. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board \nlisted five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered \nstating:  \n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.  \n\n \n15 \n                                         \n \n \nId.

See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). The non-SOR allegations will not be \nconsidered except for the five purposes listed above. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply to Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant\u2019s \ninvolvement with marijuana at age of 18 and then in 2014 until late September 2014 are \nnot mitigated. His lack of candor about the extent of his marijuana use on his security \ndocuments shows a lack of rehabilitation. Future inappropriate behavior may occur. His \nbehavior continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nPersonal conduct security concerns are not mitigated.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines H, G, \nand E are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 34-year-old avionics equipment specialist working for a defense \ncontractor for the past two years. He completed three years of college. He honorably \nserved in the Air Force from 2004 to 2008. His Air Force specialty was nuclear cruise \nmissile maintenance technician. For most of his Air Force service, he had access to \nTS/SCI.  \n \nSix coworkers, colleagues, and/or friends as well as his former spouse provided \ncharacter statements supporting reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s access to classified \ninformation. The general sense of their statements is that Applicant is diligent, \nknowledgeable, intelligent, meticulous, professional, generous, loyal, honest, a good \nleader, and trustworthy. His hard work and professionalism made substantial \n\n \n16 \n                                         \n \ncontributions to mission accomplishment. None of his character statements described \nany abuse of alcohol or use of illegal drugs. There is no evidence of security violations, \nimproper disclosure of classified information, or that Applicant compromised national \nsecurity. See ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020) (noting admissibility \nof \u201cgood security record,\u201d and commenting that security concerns may nevertheless not \nbe mitigated).  \n \nThe evidence against reinstatement of his access to classified information is more \npersuasive. Applicant failed to fully and frankly disclose the duration and frequency of his \nmarijuana use in his July 5, 2016 SCA, October 19, 2017 OPM PSI, and September 17, \n2018 responses to DOHA interrogatories. He falsely maintained in his SOR response and \nat his hearing that his statements in these document were accurate. In July 2014, he lied \nto a police officer about his alcohol consumption on the day he was arrested. He failed to \ndisclose his arrests in May and July 2014 to the government because he was worried \nabout being fired. His falsifications of his July 5, 2016 SCA, October 19, 2017 OPM PSI, \nand September 17, 2018 responses to DOHA interrogatories occurred in a security \ncontext, and they raise serious security concerns. The protection of national security \nrelies on applicants to self-report conduct that jeopardizes security, even when that \ndisclosure might damage the applicant\u2019s career. Applicant cannot be trusted to disclose \npotentially derogatory information about himself. He did not establish his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo.12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). I have carefully applied the law, as set forth \nin Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence \nto the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Applicant mitigated \nalcohol consumption security concerns; however, he failed to mitigate drug involvement \nand substance misuse and personal conduct security concerns.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraph 1.a: \n \n  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c through 1.f: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \n  \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n17 \n                                         \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a through 3.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n______________________ \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Edmunds, Esq.  \n03/10/2020 \nDecision \nMURPHY, Braden M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to timely file most of his federal income tax returns between tax \nyears 2004 and 2010. He also failed to timely file state income tax returns for tax years \n2010-2016. Given his long and recent pattern of failures to comply with federal and \nstate tax requirements, Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the \nresulting security concerns under Guideline F for financial considerations. Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on August 26, 2015. \nOn December 3, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant alleging security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The DOD CAF acted under \nExecutive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \n\n \n2 \n \n \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), \neffective June 8, 2017.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 4, 2019. He included documents that I \nmarked as Answer Attachments (Ans. Att.) 1-3. He initially requested a decision based \non the written record. He subsequently requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on October 24, 2019, \nafter he retained counsel. The case was assigned to me on November 20, 2019. On \nDecember 16, 2019, DOHA issued a notice scheduling the hearing for January 8, 2020.  \n \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1-6, which I admitted without objection. Applicant testified \nand submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A-L, which I admitted without objection. I held \nthe record open to allow him the opportunity to submit additional documentation. After \nthe hearing, Applicant provided account transcripts from the IRS for tax years 2014-\n2018 (AE M) and various receipts from the postal service and a tax preparation \ncompany (AE N), both admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript \non January 16, 2020. The record closed on January 29, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact  \n \n \nApplicant admitted both SOR allegations, \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, with explanations and \ndocumentation. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is 62 years old. He has never married and he has no children. He \nearned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1981. He has worked for the same employer, a large \ndefense contractor, ever since. He installs systems on submarines. He has had a \nclearance since 1982. He has never had any security violations or incidents. (GE 1; AE \nA-E; Tr. 25-28, 42, 44, 68) Recent work evaluations show he has met or exceeded all \nprofessional expectations. (AE E) \n \n \nApplicant lived and worked in State 1 from 1994 to October 2004. (GE 1 at 12; \nTr. 68) From October 2004 to June 2010, he lived and worked in State 2, which has no \nstate income tax. (GE 2 at 8-9; Tr. 42, 46-47, 68-69) From July 2010 to September \n2017, he lived and worked in State 3, which has a state income tax. (GE 4; Tr. 43, 69) \nSince September 2017, he has lived and worked in State 4 (Tr. 43, 69). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant failed to timely file federal income tax returns as \nrequired for tax year 2004 and for tax years 2006-2010. SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that \nApplicant failed to timely file State 3 income tax returns as required for tax years 2011-\n2016. This is based on the information he provided in security clearance applications \nand interrogatory responses. (Ans. Att. 2, Ans. Att. 3; GE 3, GE 4) \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant testified that before 2004, he always filed his tax returns on time. (Tr. \n43) When he submitted an SCA in April 2010 for his previous clearance investigation, \nhe disclosed that he had \u201cunfiled federal tax returns from 2004 to present\u201d as well as an \nunfiled 2004 State 1 income tax return (not alleged). (GE 1 at 12, 33, 34, 42; Tr. 45, 72-\n73)  \n \nApplicant discussed his unfiled income tax returns during his 2010 background \ninterview. He said that his tax filing issues were because of \u201cthe hassle of the \npaperwork\u201d and because he moved frequently for his job. (GE 5 at 3; Tr. 53) His 2010 \nclearance application was subsequently granted. (GE 2 at 23) \n \nOn his 2015 SCA, Applicant reported additional tax issues. As before, he \nreported \u201cunfiled federal returns for 2004 to 2010.\u201d He also referenced unfiled State 3 \ntax returns from 2010-2014. He explained that his tax filing issues \u201cstarted when banks \nceased sending out Form 1099-INT for small amounts of interest.\u201d (GE 2 at 24) He also \nstated,  \n \nFrequent moves, long distance, and the small amounts involved left me \ndisinclined to chase it all down and unwilling to swear to the accuracy of \nmy estimates for tax years 2010 and 2011. Not filing 2012, 2013, and \n2014 is a combination of laziness and not receiving any letters of protest. \n(GE 2 at 24) \n \nApplicant expanded on this explanation in his Answer and his hearing testimony. \nHe testified that he did not want to underreport his interest income from his various bank \naccounts, when those banks did not him provide 1099-INT forms with exact details. \n(Answer; Tr. 59-61, 64, 84-85) He said to do so would be \u201clying on a government form.\u201d \n(Tr. 62) He did not contact his banks to learn why he did not get a Form 1099-INT, nor \ndid he contact the IRS to discuss his options beyond not filing his tax return because he \nlacked such forms. (Tr. 63) He was not aware that banks do not issue 1099-INT forms \nwhen the annual interest a taxpayer receives from an account is so small as to be not \nreportable. (Tr. 59-60; Answer) \n \nApplicant acknowledged that the IRS does not have a duty to inform him of his \nown duty to file an annual return. From before his tax issues began, he was aware of \nthe significance of the April 15 annual federal tax deadline, and said it is \u201ccrystal clear \nthese days.\u201d (Tr. 81, 88-89) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s IRS account transcripts show that, as of 2018, no federal tax return \nhad been filed for tax years 2004, 2006, 2007, or 2010. The IRS prepared substitute tax \nreturns for tax years 2008 and 2009. (GE 3; GE 4; Tr. 56) (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \n \n \nApplicant testified that he did not know whether he had ever filed his federal \nincome tax returns for tax years 2004, 2006, 2007, or 2008. (Tr. 54-55) He testified that \nhe had filed his 2009 and 2010 federal income tax returns, but provided no updated \n\n \n4 \n \n \ncorroborating documentation. He believes he filed his past due returns in 2017, after \nprompting by his background investigator. (Tr. (Tr. 36-38), 74-75) \n \nApplicant filed his federal income tax returns on time for tax years 2005, 2011, \n2013, and 2014, and he filed his 2012 federal return in late April 2013 (a few days late). \n(GE 4) He also documented that his subsequent federal returns (2014-2018) have all \nbeen filed on time. (AE I, M; Tr. 44)  \n \n \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.b, the documentation Applicant provided in a 2018 interrogatory \nresponse, from the State 3 tax authority, shows that his 2011-2016 returns had been \nfiled, but were filed late. (GE 4 at 12; Tr. 57) Applicant testified that he filed those \nreturns in 2017, when he moved to State 4. He acknowledged that he filed the returns \ndue to \u201cpressure from the investigator\u201d (Tr. 58, 63, 74-75, 77)  \n \nApplicant explained that his late filing of his State 3 tax returns was due to \n\u201chabit,\u201d because he moved there from State 2, a state with no state income tax return). \n(Tr. 52, 76, 85) As of March 2018, Applicant was in compliance with State 3 tax \nauthorities and owed no taxes or other liability there. (GE 4 at 14; Tr. 39)  \n  \n \nApplicant provided a variety of reasons why he did not file his tax returns. In his \nbackground interviews, he said it was because he was \u201clazy.\u201d (GE 6 at 4; Tr. 40, 65) He \nalso said he rarely owed money in taxes. (Tr. 30-31; AE G, AE H, AE I)  \n \n \nIn his Answer and at hearing, Applicant also asserted, for the first time, that he \nhas a medical condition that has caused him severe concentration problems. Those \nissues, in turn, made it difficult for him to prepare and file his tax returns on time. \n(Answer; Tr. 41-42, 85) He was diagnosed with the condition in 2011. (Ans. Att. 1; Tr. \n65-66), a year that post-dates all of the tax years alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant \nasserted that his condition went undiagnosed for some time.  \n \nApplicant also provided no documentation to corroborate the assertion that the \nmedical condition causes concentration problems. (Tr. 65, 69) He acknowledged during \nhis testimony that none of his own doctors had ever told him that. (Tr. 70) He also \nacknowledged that he had never had concentration problems in other areas of his life. \n(Tr. 70) He said his medical condition is under control, and his concentration has \nimproved. (Tr. 42, 69) \n \n \nApplicant testified at hearing that he is current on his tax filings, including with \nState 4, where he now lives. (Tr. 28, 83) He earns over $130,000 annually. (Tr. 28) He \nhas excellent credit (AE F) and between $80,000 and $90,000 in savings. (Tr. 33; AE H, \nAE J, AE K, AE L) He has no difficulty paying his bills. (Tr. 44) \n \n \nPost-hearing, Applicant provided receipts from a nationally known tax preparation \nservice showing a $600 payment and receipts for certified mailings to the IRS, all dated \nJanuary 2020. (AE N) What was prepared by the tax service and what was mailed to \nthe IRS is not clear, since it is not in the record.  \n\n \n5 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline sets forth several conditions that could raise security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns from tax years 2004-\n2010 (but for tax year 2005, which was timely filed). Applicant also did not timely file his \nState 3 income tax returns for tax years 2011-2016. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are established \nby the record evidence, and AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(c) and 19(f) both apply.  \n \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis added), the \nDOHA appeal board detailed the security concern about applicants who fail to file their \ntax returns as follows:  \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. \nVoluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for \nprotecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 20, 2002). As we have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is \nnot directed at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No, 07-08049 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same token, neither is it directed towards \ninducing an applicant to file tax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at \n\n \n7 \n \n \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails \nrepeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the \nhigh degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015); See Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union \nLocal 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. \n886 (1961). \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \n \nApplicant disclosed on his SCAs in both 2010 and 2015 that he had failed to file \nhis federal income tax returns from 2004 to 2010. On his 2015 SCA, he also disclosed \nfailing to file several years of State 3 income tax returns as well. His State 3 tax issues \nwent beyond that, from tax year 2011 to 2016.  \n \n \nApplicant responded to DOHA interrogatories in 2018, and provided up-to-date \ndocumentation from the IRS about the status of his tax returns. The IRS account \ntranscripts he provided show that no federal tax return had been filed for tax years \n2004, 2006, 2007, or 2010, and show that the IRS prepared substitute tax returns for \ntax years 2008 and 2009. \n \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant testified that he did not know whether he had ever filed \nhis federal income tax returns for tax years 2004, 2006, 2007, or 2008. He testified that \nhe had filed his 2009 and 2010 federal income tax returns, but provided no updated \ndocumentation to corroborate this. He also testified that he is current on his taxes. \nApplicant filed his past-due State 3 tax returns in 2017. He believes he filed his past-due \nfederal returns in 2017 as well, though this is not documented. (It is also contradicted by \n\n \n8 \n \n \nhis 2018 interrogatory responses, which do not show that those returns were, in fact, \nfiled).  \n \nIt is reasonable to expect applicants to present documentation about the \nsatisfaction of individual debts (or, as here, about the satisfaction of their tax filing \nrequirements). ISCR Case No. 07-10310 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 30, 2008)(citing ISCR Case \nNo. 06-17520 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 20, 2007). As to the federal tax returns at issue in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a, Applicant did not provide such documentation. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s State 3 tax returns at issue (2011-2016) were filed, though they were \nfiled late. He acknowledged that he filed those returns because he was pressured to do \nso by the interviewing investigator. The fact that Applicant acted to cure his unfiled State \n3 returns (and perhaps his older, unfiled federal returns as well) only when his \nclearance was imperiled raises questions about his willingness to follow the sometimes \ncomplex rules governing classified information when his personal interests are not at \nstake, as well as rules and regulations in general. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-01070 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2016). Further, even if Applicant had documented that he has \nnow filed all his past-due returns, I cannot simply adopt a position of \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d \nor \u201call\u2019s well that ends well.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nAG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s federal tax issues relate to tax years 2004, and 2006-2010, a number \nof years ago. Though the current status of those returns is largely undocumented, \nApplicant has been compliant with federal filing requirements ever since. However, \nApplicant has had two separate timeframes of lengthy non-compliance with state and \nfederal tax return filing requirements, going back to over 15 years ago. He has not \nestablished a track record of good-faith compliance with his tax requirements to show \nthat his prior tax issues are unlikely to recur or no longer cast doubt on his reliability, \njudgment, and trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not fully apply. The lack of \ndocumentation in the record to verify that Applicant has fully cured his past-due federal \nincome tax returns precludes a conclusion that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) or 20(g) should fully apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n9 \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nApplicant has had a long and successful career in the defense industry, with a \nclearance. However, he has had problems complying with state and federal income tax \nfiling requirements going back many years, over two separate security clearance \nadjudications. He gave several reasons for his lack of action, not all of which were \ncredible, and none of which were enough to mitigate his conduct. Given his long and \nrecent pattern of repeated failure to comply with federal and state tax filing \nrequirements, Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the security \nconcerns that arose from his conduct. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s continued eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for continued access to \nclassified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n_____________________________ \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 62-year-old Arab linguist with a pending employment offer with a defense contractor, contingent on his security eligibility. He is fluent in Arabic, French, and English. In 2001, he applied for a linguist position with a government law enforcement agency, but failed to pass a polygraph examination for allegedly manipulating his responses and failing to disclose his affiliation with a former Syrian Army intelligence officer. From 2003 to 2005, he was employed as a linguist and translator in Iraq for a U.S. defense contractor. He worked with U.S. Army members that were training Iraqi military personnel, and with U.S. military Judge Advocates working with the Central Criminal Court of Iraq. While in Iraq, Applicant had an interim DOD security clearance, but stated that he resigned before a final eligibility was determined. In 2009, Applicant applied for another linguist position but was not retained because he was denied an interim security clearance due to his foreign business involvement.

Applicant mitigated \nthe foreign influence concerns, but failed to mitigate the financial considerations and \npersonal conduct concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on July 28, 2017. On \nJanuary 9, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nB (Foreign Influence), Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and Guideline E (Personal \nConduct). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 7, 2019, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 2, 2019. The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a hearing notice on August 19, 2019, and \nthe hearing was convened on September 10, 2019. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through \n11 were marked and admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough C were marked and admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant, his \npersonal representative, and another witness testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. The record \nwas held open until September 20, 2019, for Applicant to submit any additional \ndocumentary evidence. He submitted an email marked as AE D in a timely manner, and \nit was admitted in evidence without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) \non September 18, 2019. \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Lebanon. Applicant did not object and the request was granted. \nThe request was not admitted into evidence but was included in the record as Hearing \nExhibit (HE) II. The facts administratively noticed are set out below.   \n \nLebanon \n \nLebanon is a parliamentary democracy in which people have the constitutional \nright to change their government. Due to civil war, the exercise of political rights was \nprecluded until 1992. Lebanon has a free-market economy and a strong commercial \ntradition. The economy is service-oriented. The United States enjoys a strong exporter \nrelationship with Lebanon and is its fifth largest source of imported goods. Since the lifting \nof passport restrictions in 1997, a number of large U.S. companies have opened branch \nor regional offices in Lebanon. More than 160 offices representing U.S. businesses \noperate in Lebanon. The United States seeks to maintain its traditionally close ties with \nLebanon and to help preserve its independence, sovereignty, national unity, and territorial \nintegrity.  \n \n \nThe foreign policy of Lebanon reflects its geographic location, the composition of \nits population, and its reliance on commerce and trade. Its foreign policy is heavily \ninfluenced by neighboring Syria, which has also long influenced Lebanon\u2019s internal \npolicies as well. Lebanon, like most Arab states, does not recognize Israel, with which it \nhas been technically at war since Israel\u2019s establishment.  \n \n \nThe terrorist group Hezbollah is a Lebanese-based radical Shi\u2019a group and is \ndesignated by the United States as a \u201cForeign Terrorist Organization.\u201d The Lebanese \ngovernment recognizes Hezbollah as a \u201clegitimate resistance group\u201d and political party, \nand until recently Hezbollah was represented by elected officials in the Lebanese \nparliament. Hezbollah also provides support to several Palestinian terrorist organizations \nand is known to be involved in numerous anti-U.S. and anti-Israeli terrorist attacks. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nOther terrorist organizations operating in Lebanon include: Al-Nusrah Front (ANF), \nHamas, and Abdullah Azzam Brigades (AAB). The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant \n(ISIL), also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), and ANF have claimed \nresponsibility for suicide bombings in Lebanon. U.S. citizens have been targets of terrorist \nattacks in the past, and there remains a threat of anti-Western terrorist activity. Lebanon \nalso has human-rights problems including the arbitrary arrest and detainment of \nindividuals and instances of arbitrary and unlawful deprivation of life, torture, and other \nabuses.  \n \n \nU.S. citizens who also possess Lebanese nationality may be subject to laws that \nimpose special obligations on them as Lebanese citizens. The U.S. State Department \nissued a travel advisory, updated April 2019, urging U.S. citizens to reconsider travel to \nparticular areas in Lebanon due to crime, terrorism, kidnapping, and armed conflict \nespecially near Lebanon\u2019s borders with Syria and Israel. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 62-year-old Arab linguist with a pending employment offer with a \ndefense contractor, contingent on his security eligibility. He is fluent in Arabic, French, \nand English. In 2001, he applied for a linguist position with a government law enforcement \nagency, but failed to pass a polygraph examination for allegedly manipulating his \nresponses and failing to disclose his affiliation with a former Syrian Army intelligence \nofficer. From 2003 to 2005, he was employed as a linguist and translator in Iraq for a U.S. \ndefense contractor. He worked with U.S. Army members that were training Iraqi military \npersonnel, and with U.S. military Judge Advocates working with the Central Criminal \nCourt of Iraq. While in Iraq, Applicant had an interim DOD security clearance, but stated \nthat he resigned before a final eligibility was determined. In 2009, Applicant applied for \nanother linguist position but was not retained because he was denied an interim security \nclearance due to his foreign business involvement. (GEs 5 and 7) Of note, in his personal \nsubject interview (PSI) in December 2017, he claimed that he was unaware of ever having \na security clearance denied, despite his admitted knowledge in 2010. (GEs 3 and 7) \n \nApplicant was born in Lebanon, and met his former spouse while traveling in the \nUnited States. He married in 1983 and applied for U.S. permanent residency. He was \nnaturalized a U.S. citizen in 1988. He divorced his spouse in 1995. He has one adult child \nwho is a U.S. citizen and resident. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1981 in Lebanon. \nApplicant stated that he served three months in the Lebanese Army after graduating from \nhigh school, from December 1975 to March 1976, but claimed that the Army was \n\u201cdissolved\u201d and he was released from training. (GE 2) Applicant failed to report his military \nservice in his 2009 or July 2017 SCAs, or in counterintelligence screening interviews in \n2009 and 2010, because he did not consider it military service if he did not complete his \ntraining or fight. His claim of short-term military service in Lebanon was finally disclosed \nin his September 2017 counterintelligence screening interview. (GE 2) \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline B, that Applicant\u2019s brother and sister-in-law are \ncitizens and residents of Lebanon. Under Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have 13 \n\n \n4 \n \ndelinquent financial accounts that have been charged off or are in collections, totaling \nabout $146,775. He admitted the Guideline B and F allegations in his answer to the SOR. \nUnder Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have deliberately falsified material facts in prior \nsecurity questionnaires and interviews; and failed to disclose the financial delinquencies \nalleged under Guideline F in his July 2017 SCA. He denied these allegations in his answer \nto the SOR. \n \nApplicant has a brother and sister-in-law who are citizens and residents of \nLebanon. His brother is 71 years old and retired, and his sister-in-law was a homemaker \nwho is now in a nursing home. Applicant last visited Lebanon in 2009, and communicates \nwith his brother about once every two months. Applicant\u2019s sister is a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen residing in the United States. His parents are deceased. \n \nApplicant testified that when he returned from Iraq in 2005, he was wealthy and \ndid not work for years thereafter. He testified that he last earned income in 2009, but his \n2017 security screening interview does not support that. (GE 2) He claimed that he \nremained unemployed for the majority of the years since, but that he worked as a \nfreelance translator for a government agency from 2012 to 2016. In his 2017 \ncounterintelligence screening interview, he claimed that he worked for the agency until \n2017, and that he left the employment because he did not want to read from a \nteleprompter in a courtroom for a trial. He claimed to have sold cars for a dealership in \n2015, and attempted to open a sandwich shop and invest in a health care business, but \nthese business endeavors were unsuccessful. He lived off of credit cards and savings \nwhen necessary. (GE 2) At the hearing, he did not know how much he earned in 2016, \nbut stated that he had no income in 2017, 2018, or 2019. \n \n  Applicant claimed in 2009 and 2010 counterintelligence screening interviews that \nhe sold and shipped cars to Lebanon as part of an oral agreement with a U.S. dealership, \nbut left the employment because he was not making enough money. He described his \nassociation with the owner of the dealership as a \u201cpartnership,\u201d and stated that he shipped \nfour to five vehicles to Lebanon as part of a scheme to sell the vehicles in Lebanon with \nthe help of his brother who worked as the area manager for the Lebanese port authority. \nHe later recanted statements about being a partner with the car dealer, and denied \nshipping any vehicles to Lebanon. (GEs 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7) \n \nApplicant admitted that he fabricated his involvement with the international car deal \nscheme and denied any foreign shipments of vehicles. He never had a foreign export \nlicense. (GE 3) In a 2010 affidavit, Applicant admitted that he intentionally and wrongfully \nasked his friend, the used-car dealer, to \u201cvouch\u201d for his employment as a \u201cpartner\u201d for the \npurpose of selling and transporting cars to his brother in Lebanon. He later stated that he \nnever made an attempt to sell or ship cars to Lebanon, and never made any income from \nthe effort. (GE 7) He claimed that he fabricated his involvement in order to embellish his \nresume and to attempt to show consistent employment. (GEs 2 and 7) Despite claiming \nthat he arranged deals in Lebanon with his brother and a Lebanese car dealer he met \nwhile visiting his brother in 2009, he later denied knowing who he made the deal with in \nLebanon and denied his brother\u2019s involvement. (GE 2)  \n\n \n5 \n \nIn his affidavit, he stated: \n \nI do not want to hide anything now. The reason I made such a claim was \nthat I was embarrassed for the lack of employment or employers on my \nresumes and that when I presented them, they would not show a continuity \nof employment activity. I was under the impression that this looked \nunfavorable to prospective clients, business partners and employers. \n \nIn the past, I have lied about my affiliation and purpose with (the car \ndealership). I have none at all. I have provided false statements on my \nsecurity forms on two separate submissions and in two counterintelligence \nbriefings with the U.S. Army out of Ft, Meade, MD. I can only claim that my \nmisrepresentation of myself was as a result of business related preservation \nof my resumes [sic] continuity and to selfishly not look like I was \nunemployed as I was from Jan 06 to Mar 09. I take full responsibility. (GE \n7) \n \nApplicant did not report any delinquent debts in his July 2017 SCA. (GE 1) \nHowever, he was confronted in his September 2017 counterintelligence screening \ninterview with several delinquent debts for which he said he did not have the money to \npay. (GE 2) He stated in his December 2017 PSI, that he depleted his financial resources \nin about 2016 and he has been living off of credit cards with no steady income. He was \nconfronted with several delinquent accounts, and he acknowledged them all. (GE 3) \nApplicant claimed during the hearing in this case, that he was unaware of financial \ndelinquencies when he completed his 2017 SCA and that he was always on time and \nnever late on credit card payments before he submitted his SCA. (AE D) However, in his \npost-hearing submission, he acknowledged that he had \u201csome late payments and fees \nassessed to my accounts,\u201d but that he only discovered them after the hearing and that he \ndid not realize he had the delinquencies when he completed his SCA. (AE D) Of note, in \nhis 2010 Affidavit, Applicant stated that his financial situation was manageable for the \ntime being, but that he went from $230,000 in savings to about $20,000 in 2010, with no \nearned income at that time. \n \nApplicant testified that he did not attempt to settle, pay, or otherwise resolve \ndelinquent debts before filing bankruptcy in 2019. His delinquent financial accounts were \nincluded in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, filed in May 2019 (after the SOR was issued), and \ndischarged in August 2019.  Approximately $281,000 was discharged in the bankruptcy. \nHe received financial counseling as required by the bankruptcy process. \n \nApplicant testified that he has no current income, and has about $10,000 in bank \naccounts, and about $30,000 in equity in his home, valued at about $150,000. However, \nApplicant testified that he has received $2,000 per month since March 2018, from a doctor \nfriend he has known for 20 years who is also a member of Applicant\u2019s fraternal \norganization. Applicant did not declare this income in his bankruptcy because he \nconsiders it a gift, not a loan. Applicant stated that his friend said he could pay it back if \nhe wants, and Applicant indicated his intention to pay it back. The money is transferred \n\n \n6 \n \nmonthly to Applicant\u2019s bank account, and there is no written agreement. He has received \nabout $30,000 as of September 2019, and it is unclear whether payments have continued \nsince then. Since the bankruptcy, no documentary information has been submitted \nregarding Applicant\u2019s income, expenses, debts, budget, employment, or other financial \ninformation. \n \nApplicant\u2019s friend and personal representative at the hearing testified on his behalf. \nHe is a retired juvenile probation officer and teaches at a community college. He has \nknown Applicant since 1987 and they spend significant time together. He attested to \nApplicant\u2019s love for America, compassion, and elation to be an American citizen and vote. \nHe said that Applicant wanted to work for the U.S. military after the attacks on the United \nStates on 9/11, and is a walking example of someone who loves God and country. \nAnother witness, a retired U.S. Army Sergeant Major, had daily contact with Applicant \nwhile in Iraq. He described Applicant as having performed a tremendous job as a \ntranslator and recommended him for future work. Several military officers recommended \nApplicant for employment positions in 2004 and 2005, attested to his performance and \naccomplishments as an interpreter in Iraq; and a friend who is a local jeweler attested to \nApplicant\u2019s honesty and trustworthiness, saying he leaves the keys to his jewelry store \nwith a million dollars in inventory with Applicant when he is on vacation. Applicant also \nreceived a certificate from his employer for 18 months of faithful service in Iraq. \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n\n \n7 \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations \nas whether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to \nobtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7, and I considered all of them. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n  \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The heightened \nrisk required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low standard. \n\u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \nmember living under a foreign government.  \n \nThere is a significant threat of terrorism, ongoing human rights problems, and \npotential targeting of Americans in Lebanon. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a \npotential conflict of interest and a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, and coercion. The above disqualifying conditions have been \nraised by the evidence.  \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8, and I have considered all of them. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.; and \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. \n \n \nLebanon is a parliamentary democracy with a free-market economy and a strong \ncommercial tradition. The United States maintains traditionally close ties with Lebanon, \nbut the Lebanese foreign policy is heavily influenced by neighboring Syria, which has also \nlong influenced Lebanon\u2019s internal policies as well. Lebanon does not recognize Israel \nand has been technically at war with it since Israel\u2019s establishment. The terrorist group \nHezbollah is designated by the United States as a \u201cForeign Terrorist Organization,\u201d but \nthe Lebanese government recognizes Hezbollah as a \u201clegitimate resistance group\u201d and \n\n \n9 \n \npolitical party. Hezbollah also provides support to several Palestinian terrorist \norganizations and is known to be involved in numerous anti-United States and anti-Israeli \nterrorist attacks. Other terrorist organizations, including ISIS operating in Lebanon, have \nclaimed responsibility for suicide bombings in Lebanon. U.S. citizens have been targets \nof terrorist attacks in the past, and there remains a threat of anti-Western terrorist activity. \nLebanon also has human-rights problems including the arbitrary arrest and detainment of \nindividuals and instances of arbitrary and unlawful deprivation of life, torture, and other \nabuses.  \n \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. The United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those \nof the United States. \n \n \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made with \ncaution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States \nover matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, we \nknow friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in \nthe economic, scientific, and technical fields. The nature of a nation\u2019s government, its \nrelationship with the United States, and its human rights record are relevant in assessing \nthe likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country \nhas an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon \nthe government, the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Lebanon which are essentially limited \nto his brother and sister-in-law who are citizens and residents of Lebanon. His car \nexporting scheme ended in 2007, and there has been no known further business or \npersonal contacts with foreign individuals. Applicant is a loyal American with great love \nand affection for the United States. His life and all of his assets are in the U.S., but he \nmaintains semi-regular contact with his brother in Lebanon. Applicant\u2019s brother previously \nworked for the Lebanese port authority, and may have been involved in Applicant\u2019s 2006-\n2007 attempts to sell cars in Lebanon shipped from the United States, but he is now 71 \nyears old and retired. His sister-in-law was a homemaker and now resides in a nursing \nhome. \n \n \nI find that Applicant\u2019s ties to Lebanon are outweighed by his deep and long-\nstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States. His daughter, friends, home, and \nassets are in the United States. He has honorably served the U.S. military in Iraq. I find \nthat it is unlikely he will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests \nof the United States and the interests of Lebanon. There is no conflict of interest, because \nhe can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. The \nabove mitigating conditions are applicable. \n\n \n10 \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant incurred nearly $150,000 in long-standing delinquent debts, failed to take \naction to resolve the debts until he received the SOR in this case, and discharged \n$281,000 in total debts in a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in September 2019, after issuance of \nthe SOR. The record evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20, and I considered all of them. The following are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n\n \n11 \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s \ndebts \naccumulated \nwhile \nhe \nwas \nlargely \nunemployed \nor \nunderemployed for many years, and he lived off of savings and credit cards that remained \nunpaid. Although his work history is not entirely clear but surely erratic, he did not take \nresponsible action to prevent, reduce, or resolve delinquent debts before receiving the \nSOR in this case. His financial status is poor as he has no current income, nor has he \nearned any income since at least 2017. Insufficient time has passed since his bankruptcy \ndischarge to determine whether he is on the path to financial stability. I find Applicant\u2019s \nhistory of financial irresponsibility to be recent, continuing, and likely to persist. No \nmitigating condition applies. \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, and I considered all of them. The following disqualifying \ncondition are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative. \n \nThe findings of fact enumerate numerous incidents of falsification and failure to \ndisclose required information, which raise serious questions of Applicant\u2019s judgment, \nhonesty, and reliability. I find that he knowingly and intentionally falsified his answers to \ninvestigators and on his 2017 SCA. His failure to truthfully, fully, and consistently report \nhis background, activities, and financial delinquencies to the Government as required, \nraises unresolved questions about his judgment and conduct. \n\n \n12 \n \nI considered all of the mitigating conditions listed in AG \u00b6 17, and find that none \nfully apply. Applicant\u2019s numerous falsifications occurred over a number of years and \nseveral opportunities were presented to correct the record, but they continued. The \ndocumented pattern of false, inconsistent, and deceptive information Applicant provided \nthroughout the security clearance process has not been mitigated by time or \ndemonstrated changed behavior, and I have insufficient reason to believe that further \nconduct will not reoccur in the future. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n     \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines B, F, and E in this whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s service to the U.S. military in Iraq, and his support from \nfriends, coworkers and military officers, along with his excellent work performance and \nrecognition of service in Iraq. I remain concerned with Applicant\u2019s irresponsible financial \ndecisions and the instances of false, inconsistent, and deceptive information he provided \nthroughout the security clearance process. His conduct raises concern about his overall \nhonesty, reliability, and judgment. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with significant \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance \nbased on financial and personal conduct security concerns. Foreign influence security \nconcerns are mitigated. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n13 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nPARAGRAPH 1, GUIDELINE B:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nPARAGRAPH 2, GUIDELINE F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.m:   \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nPARAGRAPH 3, GUIDELINE E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a and 3.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nGregg A. Cervi \nAdministrative Judge \n",

(Government Exhibit (GE) 1) \nOn April 8, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. \nOr.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in \nAppendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \nAccess to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective \nJune 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2)  \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether his clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n\n \n2 \n                                         \n \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). (HE 2) On May 1, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested \na hearing. (HE 3)    \n \nOn November 21, 2019, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On December \n4, 2019, the case was assigned to me. On December 19, 2019, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for January \n15, 2020. (HE 1A) The hearing was held as scheduled. \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered six exhibits; there were no \nspecific objections to particular exhibits; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into \nevidence. (Tr. 26-29; GE 1-6) I granted Applicant\u2019s request for additional time until \nJanuary 31, 2020 for him to submit documentation. (Tr. 56) On January 24, 2020, I \nreceived the transcript of the hearing. Applicant provided one post-hearing exhibit \ncomposed of multiple documents. (Applicant Exhibit (AE) A) Department Counsel did not \nobject to my consideration of AE A. The record closed on January 31, 2020. (Tr. 56) \n \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits and transcript.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted all of the allegations.

(Tr. 22) \n \nApplicant has been employed for 65 years, including 54 years with the same \nemployer, even though the name of his company had changed over the years. (Tr. 17, \n21; HE 3; AE A) He has worked for 19 years in security. (Tr. 9; HE 3) He emphasized his \nreliability and ability to contribute to accomplishing his employer\u2019s mission.

His unsecured nonpriority debts were discharged under \nChapter 13 in 2005. Most of the reason for his bankruptcy related to unemployment and \nunderemployment in 2000 or 2001 for himself or his spouse or both. (Tr. 17) About \n$12,000 to $15,000 of his financial problems related to Applicant\u2019s gambling. (HE 3; GE \n2 at 11) Applicant said his bankruptcy debts were mostly from \u201ccredit card[s] and a little \ngambling charges.\u201d (Tr. 36; HE 3) He learned during financial counseling that gambling \nwas not a good idea, and he regretted not following that advice. (Tr. 42)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the \nBankruptcy Code in September 2015. About $45,000 of his bankruptcy debt resulted from \ngambling. (GE 2 at 11) Applicant listed $92,000 for credit cards and cash advances, and \nsome of that debt was due to gambling. (Tr. 38) He filed bankruptcy because he lost \nmoney on a real estate property, and Applicant or his wife or both lost their employment \nand had to settle for lower paying employment. (Tr. 39-40) His secured claims were \n$147,854; his priority claims were $20,588; and his nonpriority unsecured claims totaled \n$124,652. (GE 5 at 38) In his SOR response, Applicant said he and his spouse paid \n$123,975 to the trustee, and he had 15 payments of $2,755 totaling $41,325 remaining \nin his payment plan. (HE 3) He said he never missed a payment to the trustee. He worked \nmultiple jobs in order to fund payments to the bankruptcy trustee. (Tr. 23) He received \nfinancial counseling, which included an online class on gambling. (Tr. 41-42; GE 2 at 11) \nHe completed the bankruptcy one year early by paying all of the creditors. (Tr. 23) In \nAugust 2019, Applicant\u2019s unsecured nonpriority debts were discharged under Chapter 13. \n(AE A)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges Applicant is indebted to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for \n$2,877 for tax years 2014 to 2017. Applicant\u2019s tax transcript for tax year 2013 shows \nadjusted gross income of about $163,000 and taxable income of about $73,000. (Tr. 53; \nGE 2 at 19) Applicant does not prepare his own federal income tax returns, and he did \nnot know the basis for the deduction or deductions that reduced his taxable income by \nabout $90,000 in tax year 2013. (Tr. 53-54) In his 2015 bankruptcy filing, he indicated he \nowed $12,339 to the IRS for tax years 2013 and 2015. (GE 5 at 22) In June 2018, the \nIRS wrote that Applicant owed $1,566 for tax year 2017. (HE 3) On April 24, 2019, the \nIRS said Applicant owed $2,660 for tax years 2015 and 2017. (HE 3) His federal taxes \nfor tax years 2013 and 2014 were paid through his Chapter 13 bankruptcy. (HE 3) \nApplicant\u2019s January 22, 2020 IRS tax transcript shows that he paid the IRS $2,755 on \nMay 6, 2019, and $1,000 on October 30, 2019, resolving all delinquent tax debts except \nfor tax year 2018. (HE 3; AE A) The tax debts for years before 2018 are resolved because \nthe IRS applies tax payments to the oldest tax debt first, and the $1,000 payment was \napplied to tax year 2018.

(GE 5 at 22) On January 29, 2019, the state tax authority wrote that tax \nreturns for tax years 2013 to 2017 were timely filed. (GE 2 at 31) Each tax year from 2013 \nto 2017, he owed from $1,934 to $3,280 when his tax returns were filed. (GE 2 at 31) As \nof January 29, 2019, all state taxes were paid except for $1,656 owed for tax year 2017. \n(HE 3; GE 2 at 31-32) On January 22, 2020, the state tax authority wrote that his state \ntaxes were all paid. (AE A) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges Applicant continues to gamble. Applicant said he had been \ngambling for 35 years. (Tr. 19) Applicant\u2019s July 12, 2017 Office of Personnel Management \npersonal subject interview summary of interview states: \n \nIn [the] 1990\u2019s or early 2000\u2019s he may have gone [to casinos] two times per \nweek, but for the most part he has gone once per week on the weekends \nwith his wife. He continues to go once per week because this is his only \nsource of entertainment. \n \nOver the last fifteen to eighteen years, Subject and his wife have spent from \n$200-300 to $800-900 per week. They would take cash advances from \ncredit cards, which [were] tough to pay back. As a result, they had about \n$45,000 in credit card debt for this most recent bankruptcy. . . . For his first \nbankruptcy, he may have had about $12,000 to $15,000 in gambling debt \nincluded in that. (GE 2 at 11) \n \nApplicant said no one in security or his company told him he was not allowed to \ngamble or that it was illegal for him to gamble. (Tr. 16, 20) He used gambling to relieve \nstress. (GE 2 at 11) Applicant said he was in the \u201cprocess of curtailing the gambling \nscene.\u201d (HE 3) He currently gambles about once every week or two. (Tr. 34) He usually \nstays at the casino for two or three hours. (Tr. 35) He typically spends $300 to $400 \ngambling per session. (Tr. 35) He decided to continue gambling because he did not enjoy \nother hobbies as much as gambling. (Tr. 42-43) The night before his hearing, he gambled \nand lost $3,000. (Tr. 43) He had the cash to pay for his gambling loss, and he did not \nneed to charge his loss on his credit cards. (Tr. 45-46) He is willing to stop gambling if \nthis decision indicates he should stop gambling. (Tr. 52) Otherwise, he intends to continue \ngambling as long as he is employed. (Tr. 51-52) \n \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \nApplicant indicated he and his spouse\u2019s gross monthly pay totals $13,300. (HE 3) \nTheir net monthly pay is about $9,500. (Tr. 46-49) He currently has a net monthly \nremainder of about $5,000. (Tr. 49) He has $1,400 in his checking account and $22 in his \nsavings account. (Tr. 50) He estimated that he owed the federal government $6,000 for \ntax year 2018. (Tr. 50-51) He said he might owe the federal government additional taxes \nwhen he files his tax return for tax year 2019. (Tr. 51) When he gambled after his second \nbankruptcy filing, he did not take cash advances from credit cards, and he limited his \ngambling to the amount of funds in his bank accounts. (GE 2 at 11)   \n \nApplicant concluded his statement at his hearing commenting: \n \nI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry I gambled. I\u2019m sorry I did both bankruptcies. I was not \nvery smart. At the time, it was fun. At the time now, it ain\u2019t fun. At the time \ncoming up, it ain\u2019t going to be fun, the way it looks. So I\u2019ve worked all my \nlife and I\u2019ve tried to do the best I can both ethically and honorably. But again, \nI failed. So sorry. (Tr. 57) \n \nAnd again, I\u2019m not the smartest man in the world. But I\u2019m just a hard worker. \nAnd I try to do my best. And I try to help people. But the gambling was part \nof it. The credit cards [were] the other part of it. The whole situation is, it\u2019s \ndire now. And like I said, I\u2019m 74. I\u2019m having physical and health problems. \n(Tr. 60) \n \nAfter his hearing, Applicant said he was quitting gambling \u201ccold turkey.\u201d (AE A) He \nsent gambling coupons and discounts from casinos that he would be able to use if he \ngambled. (AE A) He also provided two IRS Forms W-2G, Certain Gambling Winnings, \nshowing he received income on January 7, 2020, of $4,266, and on January 14, 2020, of \n$$1,250. (AE A)  \n \nApplicant described a variety of physical and medical problems that make it difficult \nfor him to continue to work. (Tr. 21, 23-24, 65) Nevertheless, he indicated he wanted to \ncontinue to work for his current employer, a DOD contractor. He did not indicate his \nfinancial problems were due to paying for medical treatments. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \n \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. (emphasis added) \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the \nability to do so\u201d; \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; \u201c(f) failure to file or \nfraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual \nFederal, state, or local income tax as required\u201d; \u201c(h) borrowing money or engaging in \nsignificant financial transactions to fund gambling or pay gambling debts\u201d; and \u201c(i) \nconcealing gambling losses, family conflict, or other problems caused by gambling.\u201d The \nrecord establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(b), 19(c), 19(f), 19(h), and 19(i).  \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists financial considerations mitigating conditions which may be applicable \nin this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue;  \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \n  \nApplicant and his spouse had periods of unemployment and underemployment. \nReal estate values declined around 2008 causing a reduction in the value of his real \nestate property. These are circumstances beyond his control that adversely affected his \nfinances. However, these circumstances are insufficiently detailed to prove he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances for both bankruptcies. There are not clear \nindications his financial problems are under control.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the \nBankruptcy Code in 2000. His unsecured nonpriority debts were discharged under \nChapter 13 in 2005. Applicant said unemployment and underemployment caused his \nfinancial problems, and he believed it was necessary to file for protection under Chapter \n13.  \n \nThe U.S. Courts Website, http://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/bankruptcy/ \nbankruptcy-basics/chapter-13-bankruptcy-basics states:  \n \nA chapter 13 bankruptcy is also called a wage earner\u2019s plan. It enables \nindividuals with regular income to develop a plan to repay all or part of their \ndebts. Under this chapter, debtors propose a repayment plan to make \ninstallments to creditors over three to five years. If the debtor\u2019s current \nmonthly income is less than the applicable state median, the plan will be for \nthree years unless the court approves a longer period \u201cfor cause.\u201d (1) If the \ndebtor\u2019s current monthly income is greater than the applicable state median, \nthe plan generally must be for five years. In no case may a plan provide for \npayments over a period longer than five years. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322(d). During \nthis time the law forbids creditors from starting or continuing collection \nefforts. \n \nThe bankruptcy court assessed Applicant and his spouse\u2019s ability to pay their \ncreditors and established a payment plan. There is no reason to believe Applicant was \ndishonest in his bankruptcy filings, and there is a presumption the bankruptcy court set \nan appropriate payment scheme. Applicant successfully completed his payment plan. His \ncreditors were paid to the extent warranted by law and the Chapter 13 process. He \nreceived a fresh financial start in 2005. The Appeal Board has previously explained what \nconstitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \n\u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n\n \n10 \n                                         \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \nUnderemployment and unemployment were the primary causes of the first Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy, and Applicant\u2019s completion of the five-year payment plan shows adherence \nto duty or obligation. He established his good faith with respect to his first Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy. I conclude Applicant mitigated SOR \u00b6 1.a. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the \nBankruptcy Code in 2015. His unsecured nonpriority debts were discharged under \nChapter 13 in August 2019. Applicant mentioned unemployment and underemployment \nas a cause of his financial problems; however, his adjusted gross income (AGI) in 2013, \nwas $164,000; in 2014, his AGI was $186,000; and in 2015, his AGI was $191,000. He \nsaid about $45,000 of the debt addressed in the bankruptcy came from gambling losses. \nHis income was increasing and well above the national mean, and he failed to establish \nthat he lived within his means and did not spend excessively. He receives some mitigating \ncredit for paying his creditors under his Chapter 13 plan; however, he failed to provide \nsufficient evidence that he acted reasonably and prudently when he accumulated so \nmuch debt leading up to his bankruptcy filing in 2015. He did not establish his good faith, \nas defined by the Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004). \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d allege federal and state tax problems for tax years 2014 to \n2017. When he filed his federal tax returns, he owed or had a surplus in the following \namounts: 2014 ($7,000 owed); 2015 ($3,000 owed); 2016 ($800 surplus); and 2017 ($500 \nowed). The Chapter 13 bankruptcy trustee paid his delinquent taxes for 2014 as a priority \ndebt. By January 2020, all of the tax debts alleged in the SOR were paid. SOR \u00b6 1.d \nalleges he owed delinquent state taxes in the amount of $1,676. Applicant also under- \nwithheld his state income taxes for several years and then was unwilling or unable to pay \nhis state income taxes when due. On January 22, 2020, the state tax authority said his \nstate taxes were paid.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR does not allege that he estimated he owed the federal \ngovernment $6,000 for tax year 2018. He said he might owe the federal government when \nhe files his tax return for tax year 2019. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. \n26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an \nSOR may be considered stating:  \n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.  \n \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-\n0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)).

The non-SOR allegations will not be \nconsidered except for the five purposes listed above. \n \nApplicant has corrected his federal income tax problems that were alleged in the \nSOR; however, even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [his or \nher] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated to prevent such \nproblems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant\u2019s security \nworthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility\u201d \nincluding a failure to timely file federal income tax returns.

All of Applicant\u2019s \ntax returns are filed, and he has made substantial payments over the years to the IRS \nand state tax authority.  \n \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \n \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s gambling contributed to his decision to file for bankruptcy in \n2015. Applicant lost $3,000 gambling the night before his hearing despite having clear \nnotice in SOR \u00b6 1.e that his continued gambling raised a security concern. He had less \nthan $2,000 in his savings and checking accounts at the time of his hearing. He did not \nestablish he was unable to make greater progress resolving his delinquent debts. \nApplicant failed to establish mitigation of financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \n\n \n12 \n                                         \n \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 74-year-old security officer employed by a DOD contractor. He \ncompleted 18 months of college. Applicant and his spouse are hard workers who \nsometimes worked multiple jobs. Applicant has been employed for 65 years, including 54 \nyears with the same employer. He has worked for 19 years in security. He emphasized \nhis reliability and ability to contribute to accomplishing his employer\u2019s mission. He is an \nhonest person. Applicant is an excellent employee who made substantial contributions to \nhis company and the national defense over a lengthy career. There is no evidence of \nsecurity violations, improper disclosure of classified information, or that Applicant \ncompromised national security. See ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, \n2020) (noting admissibility of \u201cgood security record,\u201d and commenting that security \nconcerns may nevertheless not be mitigated).  \n \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s emphasis on security concerns arising from tax cases is \ninstructive and binding on administrative judges. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. \nBd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance and stating, \u201cHis delay in taking \naction to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only after his security \nclearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated \nhimself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected \nof someone entrusted with the nation\u2019s secrets.\u201d). See also ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at \n3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (reversing grant of a security clearance and stating, \u201cA \nsecurity clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for the protection \nof national secrets. Accordingly failure to honor other obligations to the Government has \na direct bearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information.\u201d).  \n \nThe primary problems here relate to Applicant\u2019s gambling, his 2015 bankruptcy \nfiling, and his history of failing to timely pay his federal and state income taxes in full when \ndue. Applicant engaged in gambling for 35 years, and he admitted it was his favorite \nhobby. He knew that his gambling raised a security concern, and he lost $3,000 gambling \nthe night before his hearing. He did not establish he was unable to stop gambling and to \nmake greater progress sooner resolving his tax issues. His actions under the Appeal \nBoard jurisprudence are too little, too late to fully mitigate security concerns. Applicant\u2019s \nfailure to \u201csatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack \nof judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about [his] reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information.\u201d AG \u00b6 18. \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, \nExec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the \nfacts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Unmitigated financial \n\n \n13 \n                                         \n \nconsiderations security concerns lead me to conclude that grant or continuation of a \nsecurity clearance to Applicant is not warranted at this time.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraph 1.a: \n \n  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b through 1.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Smith, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n08/25/2020 \n______________\nDecision \nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge: \nBased on the record in this case [the transcript (Tr.), Government exhibits (GE) 1-\n2, hearing exhibit (HE) I, and Applicant exhibits (AE) A-C], I deny Applicant=s clearance. \nOn 26 June 2019, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent Applicant a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) raising security concerns under Guideline F, Financial \nConsiderations.1 Applicant timely answered the SOR, requesting a hearing before the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). DOHA assigned the case to me 26 \nSeptember 2019, and I convened a hearing 23 October 2019. DOHA received the \ntranscript 31 October 2019. The record closed 8 November 2019, when Department \nCounsel stated no objection to AE C. \n1DoD acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, effective 8 \nJune 2017.  \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted failing to timely file his 2008-2012 and 2014 Federal income tax \nreturns, accumulating over $51,000 delinquent Federal tax debt for tax years 2010-2011, \nand accumulating over $92,000 delinquent state tax debt (SOR 1.a-1.e). At hearing, \nDepartment Counsel withdrew SOR allegations 1.d-1.e (Tr. 11). \n \nApplicant is a 60-year-old self-employed consultant seeking access to classified \ninformation. He has twice married and divorced, and has an adult son. He has held a \nvariety of clearances/public trust positions between April 1998 and February 2017 (GE \n1). \n      \nApplicant disclosed failing to file his Federal income tax returns, and resulting \nindebtedness, on his December 2017 clearance application (GE 1). He discussed these \nissues during his March 2018 interview with a Government investigator (GE 2). He \nattributed his failure to timely file his Federal income tax returns for the years at issue to \nhis April 2009 injury while on foreign travel. He claimed to be compliant with his payment \narrangements; however, it does not appear that he had any agreement with the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS) at the time of the interview. \n \nApplicant=s tax problems began in May 2009, when he was injured while traveling \noverseas. He underwent significant surgery and rehabilitation. His final clinical review was \nin July 2009 (AE B). Applicant claimed that his injury and recovery left him unable to work, \nand he remained unemployed until November 2011, when he became a self-employed \nconsultant. Between November 2011 and October 2017, he held a series of consulting \nand other positions, only one of which (October 2014-2015) lasted as long as a year. \n \nBecause Applicant was unemployed, he took premature withdrawals from his \nretirement account in 2009 to pay his living expenses, not fully aware of the tax \nconsequences of this action. He filed for an extension of time to file his tax year 2006-\n2007 returns, but had only used a portion of each extension before filing his returns. He \nreceived a $21,000 tax refund for tax year 2007. He had filed for an extension of time to \nfile his 2008 Federal income tax return, which gave him October 2009 to file. However, \nhe not only missed this deadline, he missed the three-year deadline for filing for the nearly \n$21,000 tax refund to which he was otherwise entitled. He also missed the filing deadlines \nfor tax years 2009-2012. \n \nApplicant=s 2009 premature retirement withdrawals resulted in significant \nunanticipated tax liability. It is not clear when Applicant first became aware of that liability, \nbut the IRS filed a substitute tax return in late December 2011. Applicant=s 2009 tax \ntranscript shows that he later filed his tax return in July 2012, made some token payments \nin late 2013-early 2014, had his taxes considered uncollectible in April 2014, made two \nadditional small payments with a mid-October 2014 offer in compromise, and had that \noffer denied in October 2015. Most of his 2009 tax liability was paid by seizing his 2013-\n2016 tax refunds; the final balance appears to have been paid in March 2017. \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nIn late December 2013, Applicant retained the services of a tax resolution service \n(AE 3). By that time, Applicant had filed his then-delinquent tax returns. The service \nappears to have successfully filed his 2013 and 2015-2016 income tax returns in a timely \nfashion, but he was late filing his 2014 tax return, a default he has not really explained. \nThe tax service was unable to reach a successful offer in compromise with the IRS. \n \nIn late December 2017, Applicant retained the services of a tax attorney (GE 2). \nHe was also not able to settle Applicant=s taxes with an offer in compromise. However, in \nMay 2019, Applicant increased his 2019 Federal income tax withholding to increase his \npotential 2019 refund, with an eye to having it seized and applied to his remaining 2010 \nbalance (AE C). In October 2019, Applicant made a lump-sum payment to resolve his \nremaining 2011 tax liability (SOR 1.c). In November 2019, Applicant entered into a \nrepayment agreement with the IRS to begin repaying $450 monthly beginning in \nDecember 2019, changing to $1,315 monthly beginning in December 2020. According to \nthe tax attorney, Applicant=s plan is to obtain a home equity line of credit on his home and \nmake the $50,000 lump sum payment necessary to pay the 2010 balance in full (AE C). \nThere is no indication to date that he has fallen through with this plan. \n \nApplicant documented no credit or financial counseling, and did not submit a \nbudget. He provided no work or character references, or evidence of community \ninvolvement. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person=s suitability for \naccess to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented. \nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG & 2(a). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself, \nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the \nrelevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations). \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant=s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, the \nburden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government=s case. \nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden \nof persuasion. \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nThe Aclearly consistent with the national interest@ standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant=s suitability for access in favor of the Government.2 \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns. Applicant failed to timely file his 2008-\n2012, and 2014 Federal income tax returns, resulting in delinquent indebtedness of over \n$51.000. While his injury, subsequent surgery and rehabilitation, and unemployment offer \nsome explanation for his failure to file his 2008 and 2009 income tax returns, they do not, \nby themselves, explain his subsequent failures to file, or his inability to get his 2008 tax \nreturn filedCan inability that cost him a substantial refund.3  \n \nThe Appeal Board has long held that failure to timely file required tax returns may \ndemonstrate a lack of judgment inconsistent with access to classified information. \n \nA person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal \nobligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good \njudgment and reliability required of persons granted access to \nclassified information. Indeed, the Board has previously noted \nthat a person who has a history of not fulfilling their legal \nobligation to file income tax returns may be said not to have \ndemonstrated the high degree of judgment and reliability \nrequired for access to classified information.@4 \n \nThis is true whether the failure to file is willful5 or attributed to the press of other \ncircumstances.6 In December 2015, the Appeal Board upheld a denial of clearance, in a \ncase notably similar to this, of an applicant who had failed to file Federal or state income \ntax returns for 10 years.  \n \nThe filing of tax returns is both a financial and a legal \nobligation. Applicant=s . . . failure to have done so for many \nyears is sufficient to raise a concern that he may be unwilling \nto follow other rules and regulations, such as those that \n                                                 \n2See, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n3&&9(a) inability to satisfy debts; (b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;(c) a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations; (f) failure to file or fraudulently filing  annual Federal, state, or \nlocal income tax returns of failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required; \n4ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014), reversing Administrative Judge=s favorable \ndecision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0608 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2000)(failure to file for five years). \n5See, ISCR Case No. 98-0801 (App. Bd. Jun. 8, 2000) (tax protester). \n6See, ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (App. Bd. Dec. 27, 1999) (routine failure to file). \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \ngovern the handling of classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (A person \nwho fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and \nreliability required of those granted access to classified \ninformation). See also Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union \nLocal 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff=d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). Indeed, as the Judge noted, \nDirective, Enclosure 2 & 19(g) explicitly provides that failure \nto file tax returns is a circumstance that can raise a security \nconcern. Moreover, the Directive presumes a nexus between \nadmitted or proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and \nan applicant=s eligibility for a clearance. See. e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 14-04648 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2015). ISCR Case No. \n14-02930 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 9, 2015). \n \nSecurity concerns under Guideline F are not limited to cases in which an Applicant \nis financially insolvent or is experiencing difficulty in paying debts. In this case his failure \nto timely file his Federal returns for several years leaves potentially unresolved tax debt. \nIn nearly a decade of dealings with the IRS over his initial failures to file, Applicant has \nonly just established a repayment plan with the IRS, a repayment plan which has not yet \nstarted, and for which Applicant can demonstrate no track record of payment. \n \n  \nApplicant meets none of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations. His \nindebtedness and his failures to timely file his Federal returns are multiple, recent, and \nongoing.7 Moreover, he has not demonstrated that his indebtedness and failures to timely \nfile over several years were all due to circumstances beyond his control. Even if I could \nconclude that the stated reasons justified the delay, it is clear that he has not been fully \nresponsible in addressing his debts or his taxes.8 Reducing ones outstanding tax balance \nby having ones subsequent tax refunds seized is not a repayment plan. Although he hired \nprofessional help, that help was not entirely effective. Moreover, free, or low cost, tax \nreturn help is readily available every tax year. \n \nApplicant has not had any credit or financial counseling, and his recent repayment \nagreement with the IRS means only that his tax issues may be resolved at some point in \nthe future.9 However, without a documented record of repayment, Applicant cannot \n                                                 \n7&20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that \nit is unlikely to recur . . .  \n8&20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control . . . \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n9&20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications \nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control; \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \ndemonstrate that he has made a good-faith effort to resolve his debts.10 The missing \ndetails of his current tax status requires the same conclusion regarding his taxes. 11 \nMoreover, he submitted no work or character evidence which might support a whole-\nperson assessment to overcome the security concerns raised by his conduct.

After high school, he worked for a private company for 29 years, until it closed. In 2007, he obtained a position with a defense contractor.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective on June 8, 2017. \n\n \n \n \n \n2\n Applicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on January 17, 2019, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. On September 16, 2019, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me. On September 23, \n2019, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing setting the case for November 12, 2019. The \ncase was heard as scheduled. Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 6 into evidence. Applicant testified. He offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B. \nAll exhibits were admitted. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on November 21, \n2019. The record remained open until December 6, 2019, to give Applicant an opportunity \nto submit exhibits AE C through G, which were identified for the record but not admitted \nbecause he did not have extra copies. He timely submitted AE C through G, and three \nadditional exhibits that I marked as AE H, I, and J. Department Counsel had no objections \nto the exhibits and they are admitted into evidence. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the ten allegations in the SOR. His admissions are incorporated \ninto these findings.  \n \n \nApplicant is 64 years old and a high school graduate. He has been married and \ndivorced three times. He has three children from his first marriage, whom he raised after \nhis wife left the family. After high school, he worked for a private company for 29 years, \nuntil it closed. In 2007, he obtained a position with a defense contractor. He has continued \nto work as a sub-contractor for defense contractors since then and has held a security \nclearance since 2008. (Tr. 12, 32-36, 38) \n \n \nIn his 2016 SF 86, Applicant disclosed that he failed to file and pay Federal and \nstate tax returns for 2014 and 2015. (GE 1) According to IRS documents, his tax problems \nbegan with unpaid Federal taxes for 2010 and 2011. (GE 6) He also answered \ninterrogatories in 2018, in which he discussed his unfiled and unpaid Federal and state \nincome taxes. (GE 2) \n \n \nApplicant attributed his large tax delinquencies and financial problems to four \nfactors: he mismanaged his income for many years; he financially supported his brother \nand three children for three years when his brother\u2019s wife left him; he supported his sister \nafter her divorces; and as a sub-contractor, he failed to pay Federal and state quarterly \ntaxes from 2010 to 2017. (Tr. 39-41, 61, 71)   \n \nFederal Income Taxes \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file Federal tax returns for tax years 2012, 2014, 2015, \nand 2016, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. According to the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s (IRS) \ntranscripts dated July 2018: \n \nApplicant\u2019s 2012 return was filed in January 2015. His adjusted gross income (AGI) \nwas $211,486. He has an account balance of $97,380 in unpaid taxes for this year, \nas alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nApplicant\u2019s 2014 Federal tax return was filed in November 2016. His AGI was \n$172,876. He has an account balance of $94,869 in unpaid taxes for this year, as \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. He had obtained an extension of time to file his returns until \nOctober 2015. \n \nApplicant\u2019s 2015 Federal tax return was filed in December 2016. His AGI was \n$155,991. He has an account balance of $72,733 in unpaid in taxes for this year, \nas alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. He had obtained an extension of time to file his returns \nuntil October 2016. \n \nApplicant had not filed his 2016 Federal tax return, as of July 2018. He had \nobtained an extension of time to file his return until October 2017. (GE 2 at 5-11, \nGE 4, 5, 6) \n \n \nApplicant filed his 2016 Federal tax return in April 2019. (AE D) He filed his 2017 \nFederal tax return in October 2018. (AE E) He timely filed his 2018 Federal and state tax \nreturns in April 2019. (AE F, J) \n \n \nIn addition to the above-described unpaid Federal taxes, Applicant is indebted to \nthe IRS for the following tax years: \n \n \n2013: Applicant owes $94,497 for unpaid taxes, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. (Answer)  \n \n2010 and 2011: Applicant owes $127,493 for two tax liens filed in 2014 for unpaid \ntaxes, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. (GE 6) \n \n2012 and 2013: Applicant owes $149,654 for a tax lien filed in 2015 for unpaid \ntaxes, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i. (GE 5) \n \n2015: Applicant owes $58,935 for a tax lien filed in 2017 for unpaid taxes, as \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j. (GE 4) \n \n \nIn November 2018, Applicant began making quarterly payments on his 2018 \nFederal taxes. He continued making quarterly payments on his 2019 Federal taxes into \n2019. As of October 2019, he paid $47,100 toward those two years. (Tr. 63-64; AE A)  \n \n \nOn July 16, 2019, Applicant entered into an installment agreement with the IRS. \nAs of that date, he owed $518,749 for tax years 2010 through 2018, and agreed to begin \nmaking monthly payments of $1,500. The first installment payment began in August 2019. \nHe has made payments as agreed since then. (Tr. 51-52, 54, 65; AE B) In November \n2019, he paid his $2,325 outstanding tax debt owed to the IRS for 2017. (AE C) \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nState Income Taxes \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file his 2016 state tax return, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. As \nof July 2018, Applicant owed his state $53,224 for delinquent taxes for years 2012, 2013, \n2014, and 2015, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f.  \n \n \nAs of February 2019, Applicant owed his state $73,086 for unpaid income taxes. \nThat same month he entered into an installment agreement with his state to begin making \nmonthly payments of $1,927 on that balance. He has made those payments since then, \nalong with quarterly tax payments of about $3,000. He also owed the state $404 for tax \nyear 2017, after paying $1,689. He paid the $404 in July 2019. His 2017 state income \ntaxes are resolved. (Tr. 66-67; GE 2 at 13-17, AE B) \n \n \nWhile testifying, Applicant admitted that he did not timely file his tax returns and \nhad no reasonable excuse for failing to do so. (Tr. 46-49) He said he was \u201cnot being \nattentive.\u201d (Tr. 50) He did not know that failing to file or pay Federal and state taxes could \njeopardize his security clearance. (Tr. 68) He acknowledged that he procrastinated over \nthe years and did not diligently address his taxes and financial obligations. (Tr. 67) He \ncandidly stated that he exhibited \u201cpoor judgement.\u201d (Tr. 52) \n \nTwo years ago, Applicant hired a lawyer to resolve his tax debts, along with other \ndebts. He said the lawyer was not diligent in working on his case. (Tr. 70) He said his \nsupervisor is aware of this hearing and his tax problems. (Tr. 68-69) Two months ago, \nApplicant hired a debt management company to help resolve $48,000 of credit card debt, \nwhich was not alleged in the SOR. (This debt is not considered for disqualifying purposes, \nbut may considered in making a credibility determination, in the application of mitigating \nconditions, and in my whole-person analysis.) (Tr. 36-37) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s annual income is $210,000. For the last ten years, his salary has \ngenerally been about $200,000, varying by $10,000 to $20,000. (Tr. 45-46, 71) He now \nhas a budget that he uses to manage his finances. He did not have or use one in the past. \n(Tr. 70-71) \n \n \n \nApplicant submitted four letters of recommendation from colleagues. All \ncompliment him on his performance and supportive attitude. They consider him to be a \nreliable individual and committed to his job of assisting the U.S. Army. (AE 6) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions, which \nare useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states that an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that an adverse decision shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of \nthe applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. Financial distress can also be caused by or \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nexacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of \npersonnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 sets out disqualifying conditions that could potentially raise security \nconcerns. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant has a history of failing to file Federal income tax returns. He did not timely \nfile returns for tax years 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2016. He failed to timely file his state \nincome tax return for 2016. He failed to timely pay his Federal income taxes for years \n2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. As of February 2019, he owed his \nstate $73,086 in outstanding taxes. As of July 2019, he owed the IRS $518,749 in \noutstanding taxes. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of the disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation of \nthe security concerns. AG \u00b6 20 sets out five conditions that could potentially mitigate those \nfinancial security concerns under this guideline: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n\n \n \n \n \n7\n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant\u2019s tax delinquencies began in 2010 and his large outstanding tax debt \nremains unresolved. He did not begin addressing the problems until November 2018, \nwhen he started making quarterly payments to the IRS on his 2018 tax debt. In early 2019 \nhe negotiated installment agreements with the IRS and his state. He still owes about \n$590,000 for unpaid state and Federal taxes. His history of ignoring his tax obligations \nraises questions about his judgment and reliability. The evidence does not establish \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a).  \n \n \nApplicant attributed his tax liabilities to providing financial support to two siblings \nfor periods of time. While that may have played a role in his choice not to pay his taxes, \nit should not have affected his ability to file annual tax returns. He admitted that he had \nnot responsibly managed his quarterly taxes, or timely filed returns. His tax problems \nresulted from decisions that were within his control for at least eight years. AG \u00b6 20(b) \ndoes not apply. \n \nApplicant did not present evidence that he participated in credit or financial \ncounseling; however, he did recently hire a lawyer and a debt consolidation company to \nhelp with his delinquencies. There is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that his unpaid \nFederal and state tax liabilities are under control. The evidence establishes minimal \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 20(c). He did not initiate a sustained good-faith effort to resolve his \noutstanding Federal and state tax debts until early 2019. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply.  \n \nIn February 2019, Applicant initiated an installment agreement with his state to \nbegin paying his large tax debt. In July 2019, he initiated an installment agreement with \nthe IRS to begin paying more than $500,000 of outstanding Federal tax liabilities. Given \nthat those agreements are recent and the amount of his current tax liability is significant, \nhe did not establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(g).  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nmust include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is an intelligent 64-year-old man. Since 2007, he has worked for defense \ncontractors. During his hearing, Applicant candidly and remorsefully discussed his history \nof unfiled Federal and state income tax returns and his large unpaid income tax debts. \nHe acknowledged that the tax debts accumulated because he did not pay estimated taxes \nfor years, despite earning a high salary. He recognizes his responsibility to resolve his \n$590,000 delinquent tax debt, but had taken minimal actions to do so until early 2019, \ndespite acknowledging the two large Federal tax liens from 2014 and 2015 in his August \n2016 SF 86, and answering interrogatories in August 2018. In addition, he owes about \n$48,000 in credit card debt that he is attempting to address. Applicant has not established \na sufficient record of responsibly following tax laws and managing related financial \nobligations. The DOHA Appeal Board has held that:  \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with these things is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). (ISCR Case No. 12-10933 at 3 (App. Bd. June \n29, 2016). \n \nThe record evidence leaves me with serious doubts as to Applicant\u2019s judgment and \nsuitability for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline E that Applicant received a bad conduct discharge from the U.S. military in approximately July 2010 after being found guilty at a court-martial for wrongfully using cocaine, and that he was reduced in rank to E-1, and given 30 days of hard labor and 30 days restriction (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Applicant is also alleged to have falsified an August 2014 Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (SCA) in several aspects: by claiming that he received a general discharge (SOR \u00b6 1.b); by denying he had been subject to a court-marital or other disciplinary proceeding under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) in the last seven years (SOR \u00b6 1.c); by denying he had been charged, convicted, or sentenced of any crime in any court, including a military court, in the last seven years (SOR \u00b6 1.d); and by denying that he had illegally used any drug in the last seven years or ever while possessing a security clearance (SOR \u00b6 1.e). Additionally, Applicant is alleged to have initially denied to an authorized investigator for the DOD under oath on December 12, 2016, that he received a bad conduct discharge and to have falsely denied any use of illegal drugs since the age of 18 despite a urinalysis positive for cocaine in 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). (Item 1.) When he responded to the SOR allegations, Applicant did not answer SOR \u00b6 1.a concerning the bad conduct discharge and court-martial for wrongful use of cocaine.

Nagel, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n03/05/2020 \nDecision \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant was court-martialed for wrongful use of cocaine detected by urinalysis test \nand given a bad conduct discharge from the United States military. On an August 2014 \nsecurity clearance application (SCA), he falsely claimed that he had received a general \ndischarge; that he had never been convicted of a crime, including in a military court; and \nthat he had not used any illegal drugs while possessing a security clearance. He initially \ndenied that he had received a bad conduct discharge and lied about his drug use when \ninterviewed by a government investigator in December 2016. The personal conduct \nsecurity concerns raised by his lack of candor are not mitigated. Clearance eligibility is \ndenied. \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 18, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline E, personal conduct. The SOR explained why the DOD CAF was unable \nto find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security clearance \neligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \n\n2 \n \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn May 25, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \ndecision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On October 23, 2019, the \nGovernment submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing three exhibits (Items \n1-3). The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) forwarded a copy of the FORM \nto Applicant, and instructed him that any response was due within 30 days of receipt. \nApplicant received the FORM on November 18, 2019. No response was received by the \nDecember 18, 2019 deadline. On January 15, 2020, the case was assigned to me to \ndetermine whether it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or \ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant. I received the case file on January 21, 2020.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline E that Applicant received a bad conduct \ndischarge from the U.S. military in approximately July 2010 after being found guilty at a \ncourt-martial for wrongfully using cocaine, and that he was reduced in rank to E-1, and \ngiven 30 days of hard labor and 30 days restriction (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Applicant is also alleged to \nhave falsified an August 2014 Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (SCA) \nin several aspects: by claiming that he received a general discharge (SOR \u00b6 1.b); by \ndenying he had been subject to a court-marital or other disciplinary proceeding under the \nUniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) in the last seven years (SOR \u00b6 1.c); by denying he \nhad been charged, convicted, or sentenced of any crime in any court, including a military \ncourt, in the last seven years (SOR \u00b6 1.d); and by denying that he had illegally used any \ndrug in the last seven years or ever while possessing a security clearance (SOR \u00b6 1.e). \nAdditionally, Applicant is alleged to have initially denied to an authorized investigator for the \nDOD under oath on December 12, 2016, that he received a bad conduct discharge and to \nhave falsely denied any use of illegal drugs since the age of 18 despite a urinalysis positive \nfor cocaine in 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). (Item 1.) \n \n \nWhen he responded to the SOR allegations, Applicant did not answer SOR \u00b6 1.a \nconcerning the bad conduct discharge and court-martial for wrongful use of cocaine. He \nadmitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d and 1.f and denied SOR \u00b6 1.e without any explanations. (Item 1.) \nAfter considering the FORM, I note that evidence of Applicant\u2019s military discharge, court-\nmartial proceeding, and sentence imposed is limited to what is set forth in an uncontested \nreport of Applicant\u2019s December 2016 interview with an Office of Personnel Management \n(OPM) investigator (Item 3) and from what can be reasonably inferred from Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions without explanation to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d and 1.f. The FORM does not include the \nrecord of the urinalysis that led to the court-martial or any military records of the court-\nmartial proceeding, which could confirm the charge and sentence imposed, or shed light on \nthe date and circumstances of the proceeding, including whether Applicant had legal \nrepresentation. Nor does the file before me for review include any military records showing \n\n3 \n \nthe bad conduct discharge and its date. Based on the evidence available, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact: \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old high school graduate. He has never married and has no \nchildren. He entered on active duty in the U.S. military in January 2004. He was granted a \nDOD secret clearance for his military duties in approximately March 2005. (Item 2.) \nApplicant received a bad conduct discharge from the U.S. military after he was court-\nmartialed for wrongful use of cocaine, in violation of Article 112A of the UCMJ, after \napparently testing positive for cocaine in 2007. Applicant indicates that he served in the \nmilitary until October 2008. (Item 2.) The SOR alleges a July 2010 date for his bad conduct \ndischarge. (Item 1.) There is no explanation in the record for the apparent discrepancy in \ndates between the end of his military service and bad conduct discharge. \n \nAfter his bad conduct discharge, Applicant worked as a civilian for a succession of \ndefense contractors in Kuwait, Iraq, Afghanistan, and then back to Kuwait. While employed \nas a data clerk in Kuwait, on August 14, 2014, Applicant completed and certified to the \naccuracy of a SCA. He indicated that he was given a \u201cGeneral\u201d discharge from the U.S. \nmilitary in October 2008, stating \u201cOpted to be discharged after first duty station completed\u201d \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b). He answered \u201cNo\u201d to the following inquiry concerning any discipline in the \nmilitary (SOR \u00b6 1.c): \n \nIn the last 7 years, have you been subject to court martial or other \ndisciplinary procedure under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), \nsuch as Article 15, Captain\u2019s mast, Article 135 Court of Inquiry, etc.? \n \nIn response to the SCA\u2019s employment inquiries, Applicant indicated that his main \nreason for leaving active duty \u201cwas to seek a higher paying salary.\u201d In Section 22 \nconcerning any police record, he was directed to report information regardless of whether \nhis record had been sealed, expunged, or stricken, or whether the charge was dismissed. \nApplicant responded negatively to all of the police record inquiries, including the following: \n \nIn the past seven (7) years have you been charged, convicted, or \nsentenced of a crime in any court? (Include all qualifying charges, \nconvictions or sentences in any Federal, state, local, military, or non-U.S. \ncourt, even if previously listed on this form) (SOR \u00b6 1.d); and \n \nHave you EVER been charged with an offense involving alcohol or drugs? \n \n \nApplicant also responded negatively to the Section 23 inquiries concerning illegal \nuse of drugs or drug activity, including the following: \n \nIn the last seven (7) years, have you illegally used any drugs or controlled \nsubstances? Use of a drug or controlled substance includes injecting, \nsnorting, inhaling, swallowing, experimenting with or otherwise consuming \nany drug or controlled substance; and \n \n\n4 \n \nHave you EVER illegally used or otherwise been involved with a drug or \ncontrolled substance while possessing a security clearance other than \npreviously listed? (SOR \u00b6 1.e). (Item 2.) \n \n \nIn December 2016, the contract under which Applicant worked overseas was \nacquired by another contractor. On December 12, 2016, Applicant was interviewed under \noath by an authorized investigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). When \nasked about his military discharge, Applicant initially denied that he had a bad conduct \ndischarge from the military in 2010, but after he was confronted with developed information \nabout his discharge, Applicant acknowledged that he received a bad conduct discharge for \ntesting positive for cocaine in 2007. However, he denied having used any cocaine, and \nexplained that he hired an attorney and fought the charge, believing that the sample was \nbad or mishandled. He admitted that he had been reduced in rank to E-1, but stated that \nhis attorney had told him in 2009 that \u201chis conviction had been reduced and all charges \ndismissed and expunged.\u201d Applicant claimed he could not recall the jurisdiction, the details \nof the appeal process, or his attorney\u2019s name. He acknowledged the importance of \nobtaining the information for adjudication on appeal of a clearance denial. He stated that \nhe did not list his bad conduct discharge on his SCA because he \u201cthought\u201d it had been \nreduced to a general discharge and was told it was expunged. He believed it was no longer \na matter of record, \u201cwhich meant he did not have to list it.\u201d However, he then acknowledged \nthat he intentionally omitted the derogatory information about his discharge from his SCA. \nApplicant expressed some concern to the OPM investigator about the impact his bad \nconduct discharge could have on his clearance, but he denied it was a source of \nvulnerability for him. Concerning any illegal drug involvement, Applicant denied to the OPM \ninvestigator that he had used any illegal drug \u201cdating back to 2002 when he was 18.\u201d (Item \n3.) \n \n \nDuring his adjudication of his security clearance eligibility, Applicant was provided a \ncopy of a summary of his December 2016 interview prepared by the OPM investigator \ncontaining the aforesaid representations. On February 11, 2019, Applicant affirmed that the \ninvestigator\u2019s report accurately summarized the interview, and he made no corrections, \nadditions, or deletions. (Item 3.) \n \n \nOn March 18, 2019, the DOD CAF issued a SOR to Applicant because of his court- \nmartial and bad conduct discharge and his lack of candor on his SF 86 and December \n2016 interview about his military discipline and discharge and his drug involvement. In his \nMay 25, 2019, Answer to the SOR allegations, Applicant essentially admitted his lack of \ncandor on his August 16, 2014 SCA about his military discipline and discharge and when \nfirst queried under oath by the OPM investigator on December 12, 2016. On his SCA, he \nlisted his discharge as general and misrepresented the circumstances of his discharge, \nincluding stating that he \u201copted\u201d to be discharged at the end of his first duty station, and  he \nconcealed his court-martial proceeding and conviction for wrongfully using cocaine. \nApplicant lied under oath to an OPM investigator on December 12, 2016, when, on first \ninquiry, he denied that he had received a bad conduct discharge. \n \n\n5 \n \n \nApplicant responded \u201cI deny\u201d to whether he falsified his August 2014 SCA by \nresponding negatively to questions concerning whether he had used any illegal drug use in \nthe last seven years, and whether he had ever used any illegal drug use while possessing \na security clearance. He responded \u201cI Admit\u201d with respect to telling the OPM investigator in \nDecember 2016 that he had not used any illegal drug since age 18. Applicant offered no \nexplanation for his seemingly inconsistent responses to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f. He submitted \nno documentation to substantiate his claims made during his OPM interview that the \nurinalysis that led to his court-martial and discharge was tainted or mishandled. Also, he \nhas not denied the court-martial, or his conviction for wrongful drug use for which he was \nreduced in rank and which is enough to meet the government\u2019s burden of establishing \nsubstantial evidence that he used cocaine on at least one occasion in 2007. \n                                                                   \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n\n6 \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern about personal conduct is articulated in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigations or \nadjudicative processes. \n \n \nApplicant was given a bad conduct discharge from the U.S. military following a \ncourt-martial where he was convicted for wrongful use of cocaine. That drug use was \ndetected in a drug test in 2007. Applicant compounded the concerns for his personal \nconduct by deliberately misrepresenting the character of his discharge and the reason for it \nwhen he completed his August 2014 SCA. He falsely denied that he had been disciplined \nin the military and that he had ever been charged or convicted in a court, including a \nmilitary court, of a criminal offense. During his OPM interview in December 2016, when first \nasked about his discharge, he falsely denied he had received a bad conduct discharge. He \nalso claimed that there was no factual basis to his court-martial conviction for wrongful use \nof cocaine and stated that he had not used any illegal drug since 2002 when he was 18 \nyears old. His lack of candor on his SCA implicates disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 16(a). AG \n\u00b6 16(b) applies because he was not forthright with the investigator about the character of \nhis discharge, or about his illegal drug use. His cocaine use in 2007, for which he was \ncourt-martialed, may not be sufficient for disqualification under another guideline because \nof the passage of time, but the cocaine use, when considered with his SCA falsifications in \n2014 and his deliberate misrepresentations during his December 2016 interview, supports \na whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, and unreliability \nunder AG \u00b6 16(c). AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a), 16(b), and 16(c) provide: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \n\n7 \n \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved in \nmaking a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative; and \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but \nwhich, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of \nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics \nindicating that the individual may not properly safeguard classified or \nsensitive information. \n \n \nThe SOR also alleges that Applicant falsified his August 2014 SCA by responding \nnegatively to drug use inquiries concerning whether he had used any illegal drug in the last \nseven years, and whether he had ever used an illegal drug while possessing a security \nclearance. Applicant denied the allegation (SOR \u00b6 1.e) without comment. The DOHA \nAppeal Board has explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has \nthe burden of proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, \ndoes not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the \nomission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record evidence as a \nwhole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence \nconcerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission \noccurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E \nand the burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present \nevidence to explain the omission. ISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. \nJan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, 2004)). \n \nApplicant\u2019s court-martial conviction for wrongful use of cocaine, as detected in a \n2007 drug test, is prima facie evidence of illegal drug use that occurred while he held a \nsecurity clearance. Applicant reported on his SCA that he was granted a DOD Secret \nclearance in March 2005, and there is no evidence that it had been withdrawn or \nsuspended while Applicant was in the military. Applicant\u2019s uncorroborated claims that his \nsample was somehow tainted and that he had not used the cocaine detected in his urine in \n2007 fall considerably short of meeting his burden of proof and persuasion that he was \nwrongfully convicted and not guilty of using the cocaine. His credibility is suspect because \nof his false statements about his military discharge. Moreover, the military is not likely to \nhave imposed a punitive discharge for drug use without proof beyond a reasonable doubt. \nThe weight of the evidence shows that Applicant falsified his SCA when he denied any \ndrug use while possessing a security clearance, and AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. However, the \nevidence of record does not reflect when Applicant used cocaine in 2007.  It may have \nbeen early that year and therefore not within seven years of his August 2014 SCA. \n \n\n8 \n \nThe burden is on Applicant to mitigate the negative implications for his personal \nconduct. Application of the aforesaid disqualifying conditions triggers consideration of the \npotentially mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17. One or more of the following conditions \nmay apply in whole or in part: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused or \nsignificantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or \nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, has \nceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with \nrules and regulations. \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply in this case. Although his cocaine use that \nled to his court-martial occurred some time ago, his misrepresentations on his SCA and to \nthe OPM investigator about the character and circumstances of his military discharge \ncontinue to raise concerns about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. During his \nDecember 2016 interview, he acknowledged that he had received a bad conduct discharge \nonly after he was confronted with the information. He subsequently acknowledged that he \nintentionally did not report relevant information about his military discharge on his SCA, but \nonly after he told the investigator that the bad conduct discharge had been reduced to a \ngeneral discharge on appeal, and that he did not list his bad conduct discharge because it \nwas no longer a matter of record. \n\n9 \n \n \nApplicant presented no rebuttal to the Government\u2019s FORM, in which Department \nCounsel asserted that Applicant admitted that he was discharged from the military after \nbeing court-martialed for wrongfully using cocaine, and also that he falsified his SCA when \nhe said he received a general discharge. Applicant presented no evidence from others \nattesting to his commitment to his work, his involvement in his local community, or other \naspects of behavior that could weigh in his favor with respect to demonstrating that he is \nreformed and that his representations can reasonably be relied on. The personal conduct \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated.   \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of her conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nApplicant requested a decision on the written record, so it was incumbent on him to \nprovide the evidence that might extenuate or mitigate the poor judgment raised by his \ndeliberate misrepresentations about the circumstances that led to his discharge from the \nU.S. military, and he failed to do so. It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding \nan applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant \nor renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. \n1990). After applying the disqualifying and mitigating conditions to the evidence presented, \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n10 \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_______________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline D, the Government alleged that in November 2001, Applicant committed an indecent sexual act with his three-year-old daughter; and that in February 2005, he pleaded guilty a charge of indecency with a child, a second-degree felony (SOR 1.a) Under Guideline J (SOR 2.a) and Guideline E (SOR 3.a), the Government cross- alleged the information in SOR 1.a as disqualifying criminal conduct and personal conduct, respectively. Under Guideline E, the Government also alleged that in January 2017, Applicant intentionally made a false official statement to the Government during a personal subject interview with an investigator about Applicant\u2019s intent during the November 2001 incident addressed in SOR 1.a (SOR 3.b). Under Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant is indebted to the federal government for unpaid taxes for the 2004 (SOR 4.a), 2006 (SOR 4.b), 2007 (SOR 4.c), and 2011 (SOR 4.d) tax years totaling $114,985. At the hearing, Department Counsel moved to withdraw SOR 4.d and it was stricken. As a result, the total amount of tax debt at issue in this case was reduced to $58,141. (Tr. 10) In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted with explanations SOR 1.a, 2.a, and 3.a. He denied with explanation any intent to falsify or mislead as alleged in SOR 3.b.

However, Applicant did not mitigate the \nsecurity concerns about his failure to pay federal taxes in 2004, 2006, and 2007. Although \nhis tax debts may have arisen from circumstances beyond his control, Applicant has not \ntaken any action to repay or otherwise resolve his tax debts. The security concerns about \nhis finances are not mitigated and his request for a security clearance is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \n \nOn May 10, 2016, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain eligibility for a security clearance required for \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nhis employment with a federal contractor. Based on the results of the ensuing background \ninvestigation, Department of Defense (DOD) adjudicators could not determine that it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant to have a security \nclearance, as required by Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Section E.4, and \nby DOD Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive), Section 4.2. \n \n \nOn February 19, 2019, DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts \nthat raise security concerns under the adjudicative guidelines for sexual behavior \n(Guideline D), criminal conduct (Guideline J), personal conduct (Guideline E), and \nfinancial considerations (Guideline F). The adjudicative guidelines (AG) cited in the SOR \nwere issued by the Director of National Intelligence on December 10, 2016, to be effective \nfor all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing. I \nreceived the case on January 16, 2020, and convened the requested hearing on March \n4, 2020. I received a transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 12, 2020. At the hearing, \nDepartment Counsel proffered Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 5, which I admitted without \nobjection. (Tr. 17 \u2013 27) Applicant appeared as scheduled, testified, and presented \nApplicant Exhibits (AX) A and B, which I admitted without objection. (Tr. 27 \u2013 30) Also \nincluded in the record are Hearing Exhibits (HX) 1 (Index of Government Exhibits) and \nHX 2 (Department Counsel\u2019s Discovery Letters, dated August 30, 2019 and January 22, \n2020). (Tr. 16 \u2013 17)  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nUnder Guideline D, the Government alleged that in November 2001, Applicant \ncommitted an indecent sexual act with his three-year-old daughter; and that in February \n2005, he pleaded guilty a charge of indecency with a child, a second-degree felony (SOR \n1.a) Under Guideline J (SOR 2.a) and Guideline E (SOR 3.a), the Government cross-\nalleged the information in SOR 1.a as disqualifying criminal conduct and personal \nconduct, respectively. \n \n \nUnder Guideline E, the Government also alleged that in January 2017, Applicant \nintentionally made a false official statement to the Government during a personal subject \ninterview with an investigator about Applicant\u2019s intent during the November 2001 incident \naddressed in SOR 1.a (SOR 3.b). \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant is indebted to the \nfederal government for unpaid taxes for the 2004 (SOR 4.a), 2006 (SOR 4.b), 2007 (SOR \n4.c), and 2011 (SOR 4.d) tax years totaling $114,985. At the hearing, Department \nCounsel moved to withdraw SOR 4.d and it was stricken. As a result, the total amount of \ntax debt at issue in this case was reduced to $58,141. (Tr. 10) \n \n \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted with explanations SOR 1.a, 2.a, and \n3.a. He denied with explanation any intent to falsify or mislead as alleged in SOR 3.b. As \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nto Guideline F, Applicant admitted with explanations SOR 4.b and 4.c, and denied SOR \n4.a. In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 49 years old and employed as a project and logistics manager by a \ndefense contractor for whom he has worked since January 2016. Applicant served on \nactive duty in the United States Army between 1991 and 1995. He was trained as a medic \nin the Army and continued to work as an emergency medical technician and paramedic \nafter leaving the military. From September 2003 until October 2004, Applicant worked \noverseas as a paramedic for a defense contractor. (GX 1; Tr. 51 \u2013 54) \n \n \nApplicant has been married twice. He and his first wife were married between 1992 \nand 1997. Applicant remarried in 1998 and had two children, a son, now age 16, and a \ndaughter, now age 21. Applicant and his second wife separated in 2005 and divorced in \n2007; however, in March 2010, they moved in together for financial and parenting \nreasons. By the terms of their divorce, Applicant has principal custody of their 16-year-\nold son. This arrangement appears to have been beneficial for all concerned. (GX 1; GX \n5; Tr. 41) \n \n \nIn Section 26 of his e-QIP, Applicant disclosed that his income tax refunds for the \npreceding six years were applied to an $8,000 debt for unpaid taxes from 2009. During \nthe ensuing background investigation, investigators identified an unsatisfied tax lien \nagainst Applicant for the 2011 tax year. During a January 2017 subject interview with a \ngovernment investigator, Applicant stated he had no knowledge of that 2011 tax lien; \nhowever, he confirmed his non-payment of his 2009 federal income taxes, explaining that \nhis employer did not withhold his taxes as he had expected while Applicant worked \noverseas. In November 2018, in response to interrogatories from DOD adjudicators and \nin response to the SOR, Applicant provided information that showed he owes $16,062.98 \nin unpaid taxes for 2006, and $9,778.02 for unpaid taxes in 2007, as alleged in SOR 4.b \nand 4.c, respectively. (Answer; GX 1; GX 4; GX 5; Tr. 47 \u2013 51, 56 \u2013 58)  \n \n  \nApplicant also has denied that he owes $32,301 in unpaid taxes for the 2004 tax \nyear as alleged at SOR 4.a. However, in his November 2018 response to interrogatories, \nhe provided a May 2018 letter from the IRS showing he owed that amount for the 2004 \ntax year after his $283 tax refund for 2017 was applied. At his hearing, Applicant averred \nhe visited an IRS office in his state and was told that he did not owe any past-due taxes \nfor 2004. Applicant did not provide any support for that claim and his explanations for not \nbeing able to corroborate his claims in this regard were not plausible. As to all of his past-\ndue taxes, apart from diversion of his income tax refunds by the IRS to satisfy his tax \ndebts, Applicant has not taken any identifiable action to arrange for repayment or other \nresolution of this matter. (Answer; GX 4; Tr. 31, 42 \u2013 47) \n \n \nThe matters alleged in SOR 1.a, 2.a, 3.a and 3.b arise from a single event. On or \nabout November 1, 2001, Applicant was home with his then-three-year-old daughter. The \nchild came into the bathroom and saw Applicant as he was coming out of the shower. \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nRather than cover himself, Applicant had his daughter touch and rub his penis for sexual \ngratification. In October 2003, Applicant\u2019s wife was expecting their younger child, whom \nthey knew was a boy. At some point, his wife found herself explaining this physical \ndifferences between boys and girls. Applicant\u2019s daughter, who was then six years old, \ntold her mother she already knew what a penis was because she had seen her father \nwithout clothes on. The child went on to describe for her mother what had transpired \nbetween Applicant and his daughter in 2001. Applicant\u2019s wife called the police and an \ninvestigation began that culminated in May 2004 with a grand jury indictment of Applicant \non a charge of indecency with a child, a felony. Applicant was arrested in October 2004 \nwhen he returned from his job overseas. In February 2005, Applicant pleaded guilty to \nthat charge and given a suspended adjudication of guilt for five years, during which he \nwas under supervised probation, required to undergo counseling, and ordered to \ncomplete 250 hours of community service. Between February 2005 and February 2010, \nApplicant was prohibited from having any contact with his children or with any person \nunder age 17. After he successfully completed probation, the felony charge was \ndismissed; however, Applicant then had to register as a sex offender in State A where he \nlived and where the offense occurred. In 2010, he moved to State B, where he still lives \nand works, and registered as a sex offender there as well. His status as a registered sex \noffender is to remain for 30 years, or until March 2040. Applicant acknowledged that he \nis embarrassed by his conduct but avers that he does not try to hide what he did. He \ntestified that some of his neighbors know he is a registered sex offender either because \nhe told them or they learned of it through online public information. Applicant is now \neligible to petition State B for removal from the registry for sex offenders because he has \nlived and worked in State B without incident or violation for at least 10 years. As of the \nhearing, he had not yet filed a petition for removal. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; GX 3; GX 5; Tr. \n14, 30 \u2013 31, 39 \u2013 41) \n \n \nDuring his January 2017 subject interview with a government investigator, \nApplicant discussed his conduct with his daughter. SOR 3.b alleges that he deliberately \nwithheld information from the investigator in an attempt to mislead the government about \nhis conduct. Specifically, it was alleged that Applicant \u201clied . . . . by stating that [he] \ninadvertently exposed [himself] to [his] daughter, while, in truth, [he] deliberately had [his] \ndaughter touch [his] genitals.\u201d The summary of interview states, in relevant part, only that \n\u201c[Applicant] exposed self to daughter.\u201d It then goes on to recount what happened after \nApplicant\u2019s conduct became known to his wife and he was convicted of indecency with a \nchild. The summary of the January 2017 interview does not reflect any discussion of his \nintent at the time of his misconduct. In short, there is no basis for the Government\u2019s \nallegation that Applicant intended to make a false statement or representation about \nanything material to an examination of his sexual behavior with daughter. (GX 5; Tr. 60) \n \n \nDuring Applicant\u2019s probation, he complied with all of the court-ordered conditions \nof his sentence. He paid all fines and costs, completed his community service, and he \nhas not violated any laws or ordinances since his conviction. He also received court-\nordered sex offender counseling during which he examined not only his own conduct, but \nfactors that may have contributed to it. Prominent among those factors was Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nown experience as a victim of sexual molestation. Applicant has not sought or been \nreferred for any additional counseling or treatment since 2010. Applicant also avers that \nhe now has a good relationship with his daughter. Additionally, Applicant has a good \nreputation for reliability with his current employer. (AX A; Tr. 31, 38 \u2013 39, 55 \u2013 56, 63) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are:  \n \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988))  \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nSexual Behavior \n \n \nThe adverse information about Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior reasonably raised the \nsecurity concern stated at AG \u00b6 12: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the \nindividual. \n \n \nApplicant committed an indecent act with his daughter, a child of tender years who \ntrusted her father to care for and protect her. His conduct constituted a felony offense for \nwhich he was required to register as a sex offender for 30 years. His presence on that \nregistry presents the possibility for undue influence or coercion because Applicant is still \nembarrassed by his conduct. Accordingly, the following AG \u00b6 13 disqualifying conditions \napply:  \n \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been \nprosecuted; and  \n \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. \n \n \nBy contrast, Applicant\u2019s conduct occurred nearly 20 years ago. He complied with \nall court-ordered sentencing requirements, including counseling, and the charges were \ndismissed when he completed probation. Applicant has not committed any other \nmisconduct of any kind, and he has a good relationship with his daughter, as well as with \nhis son and his second ex-wife. Applicant\u2019s conduct is isolated and unlikely to recur. The \nsole issue remaining is whether his behavior still presents the potential for undue \ninfluence or coercion. Applicant was credible in his assertion that, although his conduct \nstill embarrasses him, he does not hide what happened from his neighbors. All of the \nforgoing supports application of the following AG \u00b6 14 mitigating conditions: \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and \n \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \n \n \nThe record evidence as a whole regarding Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior supports a \nconclusion that he is unlikely to engage such conduct in the future and that his past \nmisconduct cannot be used as a means of coercion or influence. Available information is \nsufficient to mitigate the security concerns under this guideline. \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \n \nThe information about Applicant\u2019s conviction for a felony sex offense reasonably \nraised a security concern about criminal conduct that is expressed at AG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n \nMore specifically, the record requires application of the disqualifying condition at \nAG \u00b6 31(b) (evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an admission, \nand matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the individual \nwas formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted). By contrast, for the same reasons that \nsupport application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 14(b), 14(c), and 14(e), above, I find that the record supports \napplication of the following AG \u00b6 32 mitigating conditions: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \nOn balance, the record evidence as a whole supports a conclusion that the security \nconcerns under this guideline are mitigated. \n \n \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nApplicant denied the allegation at SOR 3.b that he intentionally made false \nstatements to an investigator during a January 2017 subject interview. Accordingly, that \nallegation remained a controverted issue of fact and the burden remained on the \nGovernment to present sufficient reliable information to support that allegation. (Directive, \nE3.1.14) The information presented by the Government did not meet that burden and \nSOR 3.b is resolved for the Applicant. \n \nNonetheless, information about Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior and related criminal \nconduct, as cross-alleged in SOR 3.a, reasonably raised a security concern about \npersonal conduct stated, in relevant part, at AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \n \nMore specifically, information supporting the SOR allegations about Applicant\u2019s \nsexual behavior and related criminal conduct requires application of the disqualifying \ncondition at AG \u00b6 16(c): \n \ncredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but \nwhich, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment \nof questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics \nindicating that the individual may not properly safeguard classified or \nsensitive information. \n \n \nFor the same reasons that support application of the mitigating conditions at AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 14(b), 14(c), 14(e), 32(a), and 32(e), above, I find applicable the following AG \u00b6 17 \nmitigating conditions: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and  \n \n\n \n \n9 \n \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nFor the same reasons provided in support of mitigation under Guidelines D and J, \nI conclude Applicant\u2019s information is sufficient to mitigate the security concerns under this \nguideline. \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n  \nApplicant did not timely pay his federal income taxes for the 2004, 2006, and 2007 \ntax years. As a result, he owes at least $58,141 in unpaid taxes. This information \nreasonably raised a security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances that is expressed, in \nrelevant part, at AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s tax debts remain unresolved and he has not engaged the IRS in any \nmeaningful way to pay or otherwise resolve these matters. Accordingly, the record \nrequires application the following AG \u00b6 19 disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nIn response, Applicant averred that his tax problems arose when his employer did \nnot withhold income taxes from his pay as he had expected. This information satisfies the \nfirst prong of the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person's control . . . .). Applicant did not present \nany information to support his claims that the IRS told him he does not owe anything for \nthe 2004 tax year, and he did not establish that he is taking action to resolve his 2006 \n\n \n \n10 \n \n \nand 2007 tax debts. The only payments that have been made consist of involuntary \ndiversions by the IRS of his income tax refunds to his 2004 tax debt. The record evidence \nas a whole does not support the second prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) (and the individual acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances). I also have considered the following pertinent \nmitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nThe record does not support application of any of these mitigating conditions. \nApplicant has not made a good-faith effort to resolve his tax debts. Those debts are \nrecent, in that they are still due and unresolved. Applicant has not received any financial \ncounseling or other professional assistance in addressing his tax debts, and he has not \ndocumented a basis on which he could dispute the validity of those debts. Finally, even \nthough Applicant may have consulted in person with the IRS, he did not show that any \narrangements have been made to resolve those debts. On balance, Applicant did not \nmeet his burden of production or persuasion in response to the Government\u2019s prima facie \ncase for disqualification. The security concerns under this guideline are not mitigated. \n  \n  \n\n \n \n11 \n \n \nI also evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \n\u00b6 2(d). Applicant mitigated the Guideline D, J, and E concerns largely through the passage \nof time and the absence of any additional misconduct. Nonetheless, as to Guideline F, \nApplicant\u2019s failure to repay or otherwise try to resolve his past-due taxes reflects \nadversely on his judgment and willingness to abide by rules and regulation, thus raising \nas yet unresolved doubts about his suitability for access to classified information. \nBecause protection of the interests of national security is the principal focus of these \nadjudications, those doubts must be resolved against the Applicant\u2019s request for \nclearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a \u2013 3.b:  \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 4, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 4.a \u2013 4.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 4.d:  \n \nWithdrawn \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant to \nhave access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance is \ndenied. \n \n \n \n                                        \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 41 years old, has never married, and has no children. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2000, and held a Top Secret clearance during 2001 and 2002 while working for a defense contractor. He applied for a trustworthiness determination after starting his current position with a major technology company in March 2015. He has never served in the military or worked in the Federal civil service. (GE 1; Tr. 6, 8, 29.) Applicant first used marijuana while attending college. In October 1998, he was arrested by a local police department there for possession of marijuana. He successfully completed a yearlong period of probation and community service, after which the charge was dismissed. (GE 2; Tr. 29-30.) Applicant did not use marijuana between 1998 and 2009.

Henderson, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n04/29/2020 \n______________ \n \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge: \n \n \nApplicant disclosed his recreational marijuana use, with varying frequency, \nbetween 1998 and July 2018. Resulting trustworthiness concerns were mitigated after he \nvoluntarily stopped using marijuana and credibly evinced his intent to abstain from \nsubstance misuse in the future. Based upon evaluation of the testimony, pleadings, and \nexhibits, national security eligibility to occupy a designated sensitive position is granted.   \n  \nHistory of Case \n \nOn September 9, 2016, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On March 7, 2019, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging trustworthiness concerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse). The action was taken under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility \nfor Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), \neffective June 8, 2017, as promulgated in Appendix A of SEAD 4. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 10, 2019 (Answer), and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) assigned the case to me on August 7, 2019. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing \non August 7, 2019, setting the hearing for September 10, 2019. On that date, Department \nCounsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 into evidence. Applicant testified, and \noffered Exhibits (AE) A through C into evidence. All exhibits were admitted without \nobjection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to leave the record open until October 10, 2019, \nto permit submission of additional evidence. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) \non September 18, 2019. Applicant timely submitted additional evidence, which was \nmarked and admitted into evidence as AE D, without objection.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 41 years old, has never married, and has no children. He earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2000, and held a Top Secret clearance during 2001 and 2002 while \nworking for a defense contractor. He applied for a trustworthiness determination after \nstarting his current position with a major technology company in March 2015. He has \nnever served in the military or worked in the Federal civil service. (GE 1; Tr. 6, 8, 29.) \n \n \nApplicant first used marijuana while attending college. In October 1998, he was \narrested by a local police department there for possession of marijuana. He successfully \ncompleted a yearlong period of probation and community service, after which the charge \nwas dismissed. (GE 2; Tr. 29-30.) \n \n \nApplicant did not use marijuana between 1998 and 2009. From June 2009 to April \n2016, as it became decriminalized and ultimately legalized under the laws of his current \nstate of residence, he recreationally smoked marijuana with a frequency that varied from \nmonthly to daily, but also included many months with no use. Before sales in state-\nlicensed stores began, he purchased small amounts for personal use from various \nfriends. He ceased use in April 2016 when informed that he would need to submit an e-\nQIP for national security eligibility, but he resumed smoking marijuana once or twice a \nmonth after hearing nothing from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) or DoD \nCAF for over two years. He acknowledged that this was a bad choice on his part, and he \nvoluntarily stopped all marijuana use after having smoked it twice during July 2018. (GE \n1; GE 2; Tr. 30-40.)    \n \n \nWhen finally interviewed by an OPM investigator on September 14, 2018, \nApplicant said that he continued to associate with people who legally, under state law,  \nuse marijuana on occasion. He said that his infrequent use in 2018 had taken place \nbecause he did not consider its possible adverse impact on his employment eligibility, \nand involved using small amounts at home for relaxation and enjoyment. Contrary to the \nimplication of the sentence from the OPM investigator\u2019s summary that was paraphrased \nin the SOR, a comprehensive reading of the report confirms Applicant\u2019s hearing testimony \nthat he stopped marijuana use after July 2018 with the still-continuing intent to remain \nabstinent. He did not say that he intended to continue marijuana use. He frankly \nacknowledged that numerous friends and family members continue to recreationally \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nsmoke marijuana on occasion, but they no longer do so in his presence because they \nrespect his choice to avoid further involvement with the drug. (GE 2; Tr. 17-18, 27-28, 30-\n39.)   \n \n \nAppellant submitted five-panel drug screen test results for hair samples he \nsubmitted to cover the period from May to September 2019, all of which were negative. \nHe also submitted a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for \nrevocation of national security eligibility. He underwent a complete alcohol and drug \nevaluation at an established state-licensed treatment and recovery center on September \n4, 2019. The facility\u2019s administrator submitted a letter on September 17, 2019, \ndocumenting that the evidence from that evaluation did not support a diagnosis of any \nsubstance abuse disorder. (AE A; AE B; AE D.)  \n \n \n  \nA coworker and friend of Applicant\u2019s who has known him for eight years, wrote a \nletter describing his excellent professional performance and personal character. The \nwriter never observed any indication of drug abuse or addiction, and described Applicant \nas a reliable, consistent, trusted advisor who performs well in high-pressure situations. \n(AE C.) Applicant\u2019s hearing testimony was honest and straightforward. (Tr. 27-42.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list potentially disqualifying conditions \nand mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Pursuant to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive or \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of information compromise.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \n \n \nThe trustworthiness concerns under the guideline for drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse are set out in AG \u00b6 24: \n  \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes three conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns and \nmay be disqualifying based on the SOR allegations in this case: \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and  \n \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \n \nApplicant was charged with marijuana possession in October 1998, after he had \nstarted using it while in college. He stopped using it in compliance with his resulting \nprobation, but later resumed occasional recreational use of marijuana in 2009. He \nstopped using again in 2016, but smoked some a few times during early 2018. The OPM \n\n \n \n \n \n5\ninvestigator\u2019s summary of their September 2018 interview was ambiguous, but was \ninterpreted by the drafter of the SOR to convey that Applicant continued to use marijuana \nand, by implication, did not intend to stop. This was a miscommunication or \nmisunderstanding of Applicant\u2019s statement and actual intention at the time. He had \nvoluntarily stopped using marijuana after July 2018, with the ongoing intention to remain \nabstinent. The evidence supports security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and (c), but not \nunder AG \u00b6 25(g).   \n \nAG & 26 provides two conditions that could mitigate the drug-related \ntrustworthiness concerns raised in this case: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n \n \nApplicant abused marijuana, with varying frequency, during 1998, and from 2009 \nto 2018. This drug abuse was infrequent, stopped almost two years ago, is unlikely to \nrecur, and does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. Substantial mitigation under AG & 26(a) was established. \n \nApplicant readily acknowledges his illegal use and possession of marijuana in the \npast, and demonstrated his effective actions to overcome these problems and establish \na pattern of abstinence. He cannot fully disassociate from friends and family members \nwho occasionally use marijuana, but has clearly delineated that such activity cannot take \nplace in his presence. He provided a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse \nis grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. He accordingly established \nadditional mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b). Other potential mitigating conditions are \ninapplicable in the absence of prescription drug abuse or any form of drug treatment. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult, who \nrecreationally used minor amounts of marijuana, with varying frequency. He chose to stop \ndoing so in July 2018, and fully demonstrated both the ability and the intent to remain \nabstinent. No significant potential for pressure, exploitation, or duress exists. Overall, the \nevidence alleviates the previous doubt as to Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. He \nmet his burden to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising under the Drug \nInvolvement and Substance Misuse guideline.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.e:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility to occupy a \ndesignated sensitive position.

His request for national security eligibility and a security clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on November 18, 2015. (Item 2.) On March 6, 2019, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nto Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nWithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n\n \n2 \n \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position, effective within the Department of Defense on or after June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant notarized his Answer to the SOR (Answer) on March 29, 2019, and \nrequested his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. (Item 1.) On \nMay 28, 2019, Department Counsel submitted the Department=s written case. A \ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), consisting of four documents, \nwas provided to Applicant, who received the file on June 14, 2019. Applicant was given \nan opportunity in the FORM to submit additional information for my consideration. \nApplicant submitted an additional personal statement on July 3, 2019.

The case was assigned to me on August 12, 2019. \n \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \n \nAs part of the FORM, the Government requested I take administrative notice of \ncertain facts relating to Taiwan. Department Counsel provided a five-page summary of \nthe facts, supported by eleven Government documents pertaining to Taiwan, identified \nas Administrative Notice - I (AN - I). The documents provide elaboration and context for \nthe summary. I take administrative notice of the facts included in the U.S. Government \nreports. They are limited to matters of general knowledge, not subject to reasonable \ndispute. They are set out in the Findings of Fact.  \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted SOR allegations1.a through 1.f. He denied allegation 1.g. He \nalso submitted additional information in his Answer and Applicant Exhibit A. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is 38 years old and married with one child. He has a master\u2019s degree. \nHe is applying for national security eligibility and a security clearance in connection with \nhis employment with a defense contractor as a global intelligence analyst.  \n \nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline B (Foreign Influence) \n \n \nApplicant is a native-born American citizen. From 2005 through 2008 Applicant \nlived and worked in Taiwan. He met his wife, a native-born citizen of Taiwan, during this \nperiod. Applicant and his wife were married in the United States in 2008. They have \nlived in the United States since that time. She became a naturalized American citizen in \n2013. Applicant and his wife have one native-born American child. (Item 2 at Sections \n11, 12, and 17; Item 3.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law, father-in-law, and brother-in-law are citizens and \nresidents of Taiwan. Applicant has minimal contact with these relatives of his wife. He \ntravels to Taiwan approximately once every two years so his wife can visit her family. \nOtherwise his contact is limited to occasional contact over Skype or telephone. None of \nthese people have any connection to the Taiwanese government. (Answer; Applicant \nExhibit A.)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife worked for a Taiwanese government organization in the United \nStates from 2009 until about the time she became an American citizen in 2013. Her job \nwas clerical in nature. Since leaving this employment Applicant\u2019s wife has maintained \nsocial contact with several former co-workers. Her closest contact currently works for an \nAmerican police department. (Answer; Item 3; Applicant Exhibit A.)  \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed by investigators from the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) in 2010 and 2017. The respective Reports of Investigation are \ncontained in Item 3. During both investigations Applicant stated his wife believed \nanother employee of the Taiwanese organization where she worked was a possible \nTaiwanese intelligence agent (Mr. A). Applicant\u2019s wife had casual, work-related, contact \nwith Mr. A during her employment. Applicant met Mr. A twice in casual social situations. \nThey have had no contact with Mr. A since Applicant\u2019s wife left that employment in \n2013. Item 3 shows that Applicant, and his wife, freely provided extensive information \nabout this person to each investigator. According to the ROI, Applicant\u2019s wife stated, \n\u201c[Mr. A] worked in a division where everyone knew that the division dealt with National \nSecurity for Taiwan.\u201d This is the only evidence in the available record to support the \nalleged fact that Mr. A was a Taiwanese intelligence agent. \n \nTaiwan \n \n \nApplicant has contacts with Taiwan. Accordingly, it is appropriate to look at the \ncurrent situation concerning Taiwan. Taiwan is a multiparty democracy, whose \nauthorities generally respect the human rights of its citizens. Taiwan is an active \ncollector of industrial information and engages in industrial espionage, as shown by the \nadministrative notice documents in the record. However, the record does not \ndemonstrate that the Taiwanese government seeks to exert pressure on U.S. citizens to \ncollect information from family members residing in country or abroad. Finally, it is worth \nnoting that the U.S. Government, and the Defense Department in particular, have a \nclose and continuing relationship with Taiwan and its military, in accordance with the \nTaiwan Relations Act of 1979, which has governed policy in the absence of diplomatic \nrelations or a defense treaty with Taiwan. In 2018 the Secretary of Defense stated, \u201cThe \nDepartment of Defense remains steadfastly committed to working with Taiwan to \nprovide the defense articles and services necessary to maintain sufficient self-defense \nconsistent with our obligation set out in our Taiwan Relations Act.  We oppose all \nunilateral efforts to alter the status quo, and will continue to insist any resolution of \ndifferences accord with the will of the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.\u201d \n(Department of Defense, Remarks by Secretary Mattis at Plenary Session of the     \n2018 Shangri-La Dialogue, https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Transcripts/Transcript/ \n\n \n4 \n \nArticle/1538599/remarks-by-secretary-mattis-at-plenary-session-of-the-2018-shangri-la-\ndialogue/ (June 2, 2018).) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility and a \nsecurity clearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to \nbe used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks national security eligibility enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship transcends \nnormal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government reposes a \nhigh degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nParagraph 1 - Guideline B (Foreign Influence) \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Four are arguably applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and  \n \n(g) unauthorized association with a suspected or known agent, associate, \nor employee of a foreign intelligence entity. \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s in-laws live in Taiwan. His wife was employed by the Taiwanese \ngovernment until 2013, and she may have continuing contacts with some co-workers. \nShe believed one of her former co-workers to be a Taiwanese intelligence officer. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \nTaiwan is an active collector of industrial espionage. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s \nfamily connections in that country have the potential to generate a heightened risk of \n\n \n6 \n \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion under AG \u00b6 7(a). \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a \nmatter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a \nforeign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. (See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).) \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nApplicant has minimal contact with his wife\u2019s family members who live in Taiwan. \nHe is a native-born American citizen, and his wife is also a citizen. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), (b), and \n(c) apply. \n \nApplicant is knowledgeable about his security responsibilities, and evinced a \ncredible intent to rebuff any attempts by foreign actors to influence him. In 2010 and \nagain in 2017 he and his wife discussed her employment with the Taiwanese \n\n \n7 \n \ngovernment, and their suspicions about Mr. A with OPM investigators. AG \u00b6 8(e) \napplies. \n \nI have carefully considered the fact that Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s family lives in Taiwan. I \nhave also considered the fact of her former employment with a Taiwanese government \norganization in the United States. In this particular case, I find that Applicant has \nmitigated the security significance arising from these facts for the following reasons. As \nstated, Applicant and his wife have repeatedly, openly and extensively discussed with \ninvestigators any possible connections they may have to Taiwan. Applicant has \ncompletely mitigated the security significance of his and his wife\u2019s connections to \nTaiwan. Paragraph 1 is found for Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(b), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but warrant additional comment. Applicant has shown \nhimself to be a talented and patriotic American citizen and member of the defense \nindustry. He can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United \nStates due to his sense of loyalty to the United States. There is very minimal, if any, \npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress. \n  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. For all \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the Foreign Influence security concerns.  \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.g:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \nWilford H. Ross \nAdministrative Judge \n",

(Item 3.)  On May 15, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. (Item 1.)  The \naction was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines, effective within the DoD after \nJune 8, 2017.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 2, 2019. He requested that his case be \ndecided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing. (Item 2.) On \nSeptember 23, 2019, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case. A \ncomplete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing ten exhibits, was \n\n \n2 \n \nsent to the Applicant and received on October 2, 2019. The FORM notified Applicant \nthat he had an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM.  Applicant \nresponded to the FORM on October 3, 2019 and submitted one document, referred to \nas Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A, which was admitted into evidence without objection.  DOHA \nassigned the case to me on December 5, 2019. Items 1 through 10 are admitted into \nevidence and hereinafter referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 10.     \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 56 years old.  He is unmarried.  He holds the position of 3rd Mate with \nthe Merchant Marine and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his \nemployment.  He is currently on disability from his job.      \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.   \n  \nThe SOR identified ten allegations under this guideline concerning Applicant\u2019s \nfailure to file his Federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2016, 2017, and \n2018; back taxes owed as a result; and a number of delinquent debts that were placed \nfor collection.  In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admits allegations 1.a., through 1.d., \nand he denied the remaining allegations, 1.e., through 1.j., asserting that they have \nbeen paid.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s employment history includes at least two instances of termination and \none of resignation prior to his termination.  The cause for his termination from \nemployment from his job in 2015 also resulted in suspension of his Merchant Marine \nLicense for six months upon agreement with the Coast Guard.  (Government Exhibit 3.)  \nHe has an extensive history of unemployment, starting most recently and then working \nbackwards, from November 2013 to January 2014; July 2013 to October 2013; April \n2013 to June 2013; April 2012 to March 2013; November 2010 to March 2012; August \n2009 to August 2010; May 2008 to June 2009; and from February 2007 to July 2007.  \nApplicant began working for his current employer in June 2017.  In November 2017, he \nwas injured on his job, and has been unemployed and on disability since then.          \n \n \nApplicant admitted that at one time he owed approximately $14,656 in back taxes \nto the State of Delaware for tax years 2010, 2012, and 2013.  As a result, in April 2008, \nthe State of Delaware entered a tax lien against him in the amount of $2,573.  Applicant \nstates that in September 2017, he set up a payment plan to pay his Delaware state \ntaxes and was making payments until he suffered a knee injury on the job in December \n2017.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nIn response to the FORM, Applicant submitted a letter from the Delaware state \ntax authorities indicating that as of August 29, 2019, Applicant had a zero balance owed \ntoward back taxes.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)  Applicant also submitted a letter he \nprepared that stated that as of July 2, 2019, he had paid the debts set forth in \nallegations 1.f., through 1.j.  These debts are mainly delinquent medical bills that total \napproximately $600.  He did not provide copies of any receipts or proof of payments \nmade to these creditors.  There is no documentation in the record to substantiate the \nfact that his delinquent debts have been paid.         \n \n \n \nApplicant has not yet filed his Federal income tax returns for tax years 2016, \n2017, and 2018.  There is also no evidence in the record that he has filed his state \nincome tax returns for tax years 2016, 2017, and 2018.  He has no excuse for not timely \nfiling these income tax returns.         \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision.  The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept.  The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d  The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are possibly applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as \nrequired or the fraudulent filing of the same.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n  \nApplicant is a procrastinator who did not file his state or Federal income tax \nreturns on time from 2016, 2017, and 2018.  There is nothing in the record to mitigate \nthis violation of the laws and there is no excuse for this misconduct.  Applicant has not \ndemonstrated the high degree of judgment, reliability and trustworthiness required to \nhold a security clearance. \n       \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent  or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n  \nIt is noted that Applicant has a long history of unemployment and has been \nterminated in the past on at least two occasions.  He also had a knee injury that caused \nhim to miss some work.  However, Applicant has not expressed that he understands the \nimportance of filing his income tax returns on time, nor has he been diligent and \nresponsible over the years in filing them.  There is no evidence in the record to show \nthat even as of today he has filed his state or Federal income tax returns for 2016, 2017 \nand 2018.  During this period, he established a pattern of not complying with Federal or \nstate law.   \n \n          Applicant has resolved his state taxes.  He also claims that he has also paid his \nother delinquent medical bills and miscellaneous consumer debt set forth in the SOR.  \nHowever, in regard to these debts, he has failed to provide sufficient documentation to \nsubstantiate his testimony.  There is nothing in the record to show that he has actually \npaid these debts.  There has been no receipts submitted from the creditors or other \nproof of payment offered.  Under the circumstances, his failure to file his Federal and \nstate income tax returns for tax years 2016, 2017 and 2018 is sufficient by itself to find \n\n \n6 \n \nthat the Applicant is ineligible for access to classified information.  This pattern of \nconduct has not demonstrated sufficient good judgment and reliability to show that he \nhas earned the privilege to access to classified information, or that he will abide by the \nrules and regulations required of him while holding a security clearance.  Full mitigation \nhas not been established.   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b., through 1.d.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 67 years old, and had three children during two marriages that ended in divorce. Neither former husband paid her any child support. She earned an associate\u2019s degree in 1994, a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1996, and a master\u2019s degree in 2007. She applied for a trustworthiness determination in connection with starting her contract work in December 2017 as a counselor at a Navy Fleet and Family Services Center. She has never served in the military or worked in the Federal civil service. (GE 1; Tr. 15-17, 40- 42.) From October 1999 to May 2016, Applicant worked as a domestic violence legal victim advocate in the Human Resource Department of a Native American Tribe. She was then laid off, through no fault of her own, when her position was eliminated due to lack of work. When she was laid off she was earning about $92,000 per year. (GE 1; GE 6; Tr. 39, 48-49.) In December 1995, Applicant purchased a home for about $200,000 with funds that she inherited from her parents\u2019 estate. In 2000 and 2005, respectively, she mortgaged and refinanced this property to withdraw equity funds. In 2009, during the financial collapse and mortgage financing turmoil, she lost the home through foreclosure. She spent about $40,000 on legal fees in her unsuccessful attempt to retain ownership of her home. (GE 1; GE 6; Tr. 42-43, 53.)

Henderson, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n05/04/2020 \nDecision \nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has extensive student loan debt that was in temporary forbearance \nduring 2019. She cannot afford to repay many other delinquent medical, income tax, and \nconsumer credit debts, and defaulted on her most recent bankruptcy plan after her Victim \nAdvocate position was eliminated in 2016. Resulting trustworthiness concerns were not \nmitigated. Based upon evaluation of the testimony, pleadings, and exhibits, national \nsecurity eligibility to occupy a designated sensitive position is denied.   \nHistory of Case \nOn November 15, 2017, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On February 15, 2019, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). \nThe action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AG), effective June 8, 2017, as promulgated in Appendix A of SEAD 4. \n\n \n \n \n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 1, 2019 (Answer), and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) assigned the case to me on June 6, 2019. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on \nAugust 15, 2019, setting the hearing for September 10, 2019. On that date, Department \nCounsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 into evidence. Applicant testified, \nand offered Exhibits (AE) A through D into evidence. All exhibits were admitted without \nobjection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to leave the record open until October 3, 2019, to \npermit submission of additional evidence, objections, and comments. DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on September 18, 2019. Applicant submitted several additional \ncomments, which were admitted into evidence as AE E, and the record closed as \nscheduled.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 67 years old, and had three children during two marriages that ended \nin divorce. Neither former husband paid her any child support. She earned an associate\u2019s \ndegree in 1994, a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1996, and a master\u2019s degree in 2007. She applied \nfor a trustworthiness determination in connection with starting her contract work in \nDecember 2017 as a counselor at a Navy Fleet and Family Services Center. She has \nnever served in the military or worked in the Federal civil service. (GE 1; Tr. 15-17, 40-\n42.) \n \n \nFrom October 1999 to May 2016, Applicant worked as a domestic violence legal \nvictim advocate in the Human Resource Department of a Native American Tribe. She was \nthen laid off, through no fault of her own, when her position was eliminated due to lack of \nwork. When she was laid off she was earning about $92,000 per year. (GE 1; GE 6; Tr. \n39, 48-49.) \n \n \nIn December 1995, Applicant purchased a home for about $200,000 with funds \nthat she inherited from her parents\u2019 estate. In 2000 and 2005, respectively, she \nmortgaged and refinanced this property to withdraw equity funds. In 2009, during the \nfinancial collapse and mortgage financing turmoil, she lost the home through foreclosure. \nShe spent about $40,000 on legal fees in her unsuccessful attempt to retain ownership \nof her home. (GE 1; GE 6; Tr. 42-43, 53.)   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s bankruptcy court record indicates that she and her second husband \nfiled bankruptcy proceedings in September 1985 that were closed in September 1988. \nShe then filed bankruptcy proceedings herself in October 1988 and April 2002, which \nwere closed in February 1989 and February 2005, respectively. These actions were not \nalleged as security concerns in the SOR, and no further detail concerning the proceedings \nwas made a matter of record. (GE 2; Tr. 26, 28.) \n \n \nApplicant most recently filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in April 2014, \nseeking to resolve $117,349 in unsecured nonpriority claims, and $59,246 in U.S. Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS) claims. She was in compliance with her five-year bankruptcy plan \nuntil June 2016, after she was laid off from the $92,000-per-year victim advocacy position \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nshe had held for more than 15 years. This bankruptcy was finally dismissed and closed \nin March 2017 when she could not afford to continue making plan payments despite \napplying for unemployment compensation and early Social Security benefits. (Answer; \nGE 1; GE 2; Tr. 28, 39-40.) \n \n \nThe IRS filed a $19,533 federal tax lien against Applicant in March 2014, shortly \nbefore her latest bankruptcy filing. She attributed her tax debt to having insufficient funds \nwithheld during several years when she worked two jobs at the same time, but did not \nprovide further details. She said that she had been in telephonic contact with the IRS, but \nwas unsuccessful in reaching an agreement that could resolve her tax delinquencies. \n(Answer; GE 1; GE 3; GE 6; Tr. 52-54.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that five of Applicant\u2019s student loan accounts, totaling $26,710, \nhad been placed for collection. In her March 2019 Answer, Applicant denied these \nallegations and said the accounts were then in a good-standing repayment status with a \ndifferent loan servicing agency. She provided documentation at the hearing which \nconfirmed that statement; and further documentation that on August 21, 2019, the agency \ngranted her request for forbearance of payments toward her outstanding $24,952 \nprincipal balance until December 28, 2019. Although no payments toward these loans \nwere documented, she provided a statement showing that she had fully repaid five \nstudent loans she opened from 1995 to 1997, which totaled $18,772. (Answer; GE 1; GE \n3; GE 6; AE A; AE B; AE C; Tr. 38, 48, 52.) \n \n \nAs alleged in the SOR, and admitted by Applicant, she has at least 15 delinquent \nmedical debts, ranging from $59 to $226 and totaling $2,046. She denied owing four other \nSOR-alleged medical debts totaling $555 that had been placed for collection; claiming \nthey were probably duplicates of her admitted delinquent medical bills although none of \nthe amounts due were the same. These medical debts appear to be relatively small \nancillary or co-pay charges, many of which resulted from her recent operation to address \na heart-related condition. Applicant also has eight consumer credit accounts that were \nplaced for collection or charged off, totaling $6,715. She provided no evidence indicating \nprogress toward resolving any of these accounts, or the means to do so.   \n \n \nApplicant declined to provide a financial statement with details concerning her \nincome, living expenses, and plans for debt repayment. She said her financial troubles \nwere ongoing, despite her frugal lifestyle while commuting a long distance every day with \nan old vehicle to work at her job that pays $18.72 per hour. (TR. 49-54.) \n \n  \nApplicant is a person of excellent character. Her testimony was honest and \nstraightforward. Her pastor testified at length about her outstanding integrity, caring \nnature, and dedication to caring for others. She is an important officer in her church, and \nhas overcome numerous setbacks and hardships through two difficult marriages and \nseveral employment setbacks. She has received numerous academic and community \nawards, honors, and other forms of recognition for her achievements. (AE D; Tr. 41-43, \n45-48.) \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list potentially disqualifying conditions \nand mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Pursuant to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive or \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of information compromise. Finally, \nas emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201c[a]ny determination under this \norder adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant has a lengthy history of financial difficulties that arose before she \nobtained her current employment, but continue under present circumstances. She owes \nlarge balances for student loans, which were temporarily put in forbearance of payment \nstatus at her request, but remain unpaid. She also has numerous medical and consumer \ndebts, none of which are individually significant, but which cumulatively overwhelm her \nability to address and resolve them. She also owes between $19,000 and $60,000 in \nunpaid federal income taxes with accumulated interest and fees. She tried, but failed, to \naddress some of these obligations through a Chapter 13 bankruptcy that was closed for \nfailure to make required payments. These facts establish prima facie support for the \nforegoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate the \nresulting security concerns. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\n \nThe guideline includes six conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nSome of Applicant\u2019s financial troubles arose from employment circumstances that \nwere beyond her control, but they were not resolved by obtaining her current job. She \noffered no evidence of professional credit counseling, has not reestablished financial \nsolvency, and has not repaid or complied with repayment agreements concerning any of \nher medical, consumer, and tax delinquencies. She admittedly could not demonstrate the \nmeans to successfully establish a pattern of financial responsibility. She accordingly failed \nto establish mitigation of security concerns raised by her acknowledged delinquent debts \nunder AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (b), (c), (d), or (g).  \n \nAlthough she formally denied several of the debts alleged in the SOR, those \ndenials were based on her inability to recall or recognize the debts rather than any \nsubstantiated basis to dispute their legitimacy. Accordingly, she did not show mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6 20(e). \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult, who \nhas demonstrated her good character in overcoming many obstacles, achieving \neducational success, and providing important social services to others. However, she has \nnot resolved her extensive delinquent indebtedness through repayment or established \naffordable repayment agreements. Applicant did not provide persuasive evidence of \nfinancial rehabilitation or sufficient income stability to ensure solvency in the future. The \npotential for pressure, exploitation, or duress remains undiminished. Overall, the evidence \nestablishes significant doubt as to Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. She did not meet \nher burden to mitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline for financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.pp:   \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant national security \neligibility. National security eligibility to occupy a designated sensitive position is denied. \n \n \n                                      \n     \n \n \n \n \n \nDAVID M.

He was contracted to a different defense contractor from June \n2007 to March 2014. He seeks to retain the clearance he was issued in May 2009 (GE \n1). \nApplicant married in March 1987, and had two children with his wife, an adult son \nand an adult daughter. However, in the 1990s, he became involved with another woman, \nand had three children with her: two adult daughters, and a soon-to-be-20 son.

He describes starting his own \ncompany in about 2002, with about 15 employees, and a single, big client, but that ended \nabruptly in about 2003 (Tr. 29-30). He then got a job with a Government contractor. In \nabout 2005, he started up his company again, as a vehicle for contracting his services, \nand continued to work for his previous employer. He used a commercially-available tax \npreparation software to do his taxes (Tr. 31). In late 2011, the Internal Revenue Service \n(IRS) audited him for tax years 2008-2010, and disallowed a number of business \ndeductions, which left him with a large tax liability. In spring 2012, Applicant experienced \na medical condition that required surgery, and a week=s hospital stay. Over the next few \nyears, he spent another three weeks in the hospital (Tr. 32-33). In 2012, he was also \ndiagnosed with depression. Nevertheless, he did what he could to address his tax \nindebtedness. \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file his 2010, 2011, and 2016 state \nand Federal income tax returns. Applicant reported this on his December 2017 clearance \napplication (GE 1), asserting that he had made payment arrangements on his \napproximately $22,000 combined 2010 debt, and satisfied the debt in August 2016, had \nmade payment arrangements on his approximately $28,000 combined 2011 debt in \nAugust 2015, and was paying $3,350 monthly, and was making payment arrangements \nfor his approximately $23,000 combined 2016 tax debt. He also reported a $1,300 \nmedical debt. All the SOR debts are listed in Applicant=s January 2018 credit report (GE \n2). They do not appear in Applicant=s November 2018 credit report (GE 4) because it \nreports accounts with one credit bureau, and not the bureau that reported those debts on \nGE 2. \nApplicant later acknowledged that he also failed to timely file his 2012-2014 state \nand Federal income tax returns (AE B, Tab A. 3).

Applicant stated that he had made \npayment arrangements with the medical creditors at SOR 1.h-1.j, and was current on his \npayments. He also stated that he had made payment arrangements with the IRS for tax \nyears 2010, 2011, and 2016, and was making payments. Applicant attributed his tax \nissues solely to his inability to make the large lump-sum payments required to satisfy his \ntax liabilities. He repeated this explanation to the Government investigator. \nApplicant provided a May 2019 printout listing official payments to the IRS and the \nstate beginning in June 2012 through a single payment in May 2018 (AE B, Tab A.4). The \npayments were irregular, and it appears that Applicant entered into multiple installment \nagreements with the IRS, with varying degrees of constancy and success. From \nSeptember 2014 through May 2015 he made regular required payments; June 2015 he \nmade a partial payment; he made the July 2015 payment with two checks; and the same \nwith August 2015; he made the September payment late; missed the November 2015 \npayment; made the December 2015 payment on time; then no installment payment until \nMay 2018. \nApplicant=s tax year 2010 IRS account transcript (AE B, Tab A.1) shows that his \ntax return was filed only a month late. It largely confirms the official payments records, \nbut also shows a large gap in payments between August 2015 and June 2017. The \nresumption of payments in June 2017 lasted until May 2018, although several of the 2018 \npayments were dishonored and had to be made up. Applicant paid over $69,000 to the \nIRS, and as of May 2019 owes only accrued interest and penalties. His 2011 account \ntranscript shows a $61,759.44 balance as of May 2019 (AE B, Tab A.2); his 2012, 2013, \nand 2014 tax transcripts show balances of $56,913.57, $47,900.38, and $11,223.39, \nrespectively (AE B, Tab A.3). Applicant did not provide a tax transcript for 2016. \nAs a result of his failure to timely file these returns, in March 2013, the Federal \ngovernment obtained a $141,017.68 tax lien for tax years 2009-2011 (SOR 1.d)(GE 6), \nand in January 2014 obtained a $39,918.63 tax lien for tax year 2012 (SOR 1.c) GE 5), \nfor $180,939 total Federal tax liens. In August 2012, the state filed a $39,369.11 tax lien \nfor tax years 2009-2010, which Applicant paid in March 2018, before the SOR was issued \n(SOR 1.f)GE 7). In February 2013, the state filed a $12,596.72 tax lien for tax year 2011 \n(SOR 1e)(GE 7). GE 7 also reports tax liens for 2005, 2012, and 2013, that were satisfied \nbefore the SOR was issued. However, GE 7 also reports a March 2019 state lien of \n$87,345.06 for tax years 2009-2014. \nAlso alleged in the SOR were a delinquent child support account (SOR 1.g) and \nthree delinquent medical accounts (SOR 1.h-1.i). Applicant produced an April 2019 child \nsupport record that showed no arrears as of January 2017 (the reported delinquencies \nwere dated 2015)(AE B, Tab G). He produced an April 2019 letter from the SOR 1.h \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncreditor, showing a pending monthly payment for May 2019 (AE B, Tab H).

He produced a May 2019 letter from the SOR 1.j creditor, showing the account \npaid in full (AE B, Tab J). \nIn May 2018, Applicant hired a professional tax relief company to help him deal \nwith Federal and state issues, and appointed it as his representative (AE B, Tab A.5). \nApplicant=s tax transcripts reflect the appointment of a representative around that time. In \nMay 2019, the representative provided Applicant=s current tax status (AE B, Tab A.6). \nApplicant has filed all his Federal income tax returns through 2017, owes the IRS \n$190,765Cof which he has paid $1,000Cand expects to have an installment agreement \nwithin the next 30-60 days (or approximately the end of July 2019). The due date for his \n2019 return has been extended to October 2019. Applicant is compliant with IRS \nrequirements, which is what makes him eligible for an installment agreement. The \nrepresentative estimates his required monthly payment between $2,500-$3,500. The \nrepresentative did not provide a current status for Applicant=s state tax issues. Applicant \nclaimed to have had a repayment plan with the state until February 2018, when the state \ntried to withdraw over $99,000 from his bank account (AE B, Tab B). Applicant \ndocumented the attempted withdrawal (AE B, Tab B.1), but no prior payments. AE B, Tab \nA.4 documents only a handful of payments to the state, none after September 2015. \nApplicant=s final state tax liability is undetermined. He produced the actual lien of \njudgment for unpaid state tax showing $87,345.06 due as of February 2019, for tax years \n2009 through 2014 (AE B, Tab D.1).   \nApplicant=s work and character references [three recent work references from the \nGovernment agency Applicant supports and a long-standing friend (AE A)], all consider \nApplicant honest and trustworthy, and recommend him for his clearance. Only the friend \nis aware of the SOR issues and Applicant=s health issues, but he also comments favorably \non Applicant=s community involvement. It does not appear that Applicant has received \ncredit or financial counseling. He provided a budget that shows $101 positive monthly \ncash flow, after providing for a $3,500 payment on lien or judgment (presumably the IRS), \nand a $1,300 payment to other (presumably the state lien). \nPolicies \nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person=s suitability for \naccess to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented. \nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG & 2(a). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself, \nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the \nrelevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant=s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, the \nburden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government=s case. \nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden \nof persuasion. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. \nThe Aclearly consistent with the national interest@ standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant=s suitability for access in favor of the Government.2 \nAnalysis \nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns. Applicant failed to timely file his Federal \nincome tax returns for 2010-2011,, and 2016, as required.3  Applicant knew he was \nrequired to file his income tax returns, and he knew that his stated reason for failing to file \ndid not excuse his conduct. \nThe Appeal Board has long held that failure to timely file required tax returns may \ndemonstrate a lack of judgment inconsistent with access to classified information. \nA person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal \nobligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good \njudgment and reliability required of persons granted access to \nclassified information. Indeed, the Board has previously noted \nthat a person who has a history of not fulfilling their legal \nobligation to file income tax returns may be said not to have \ndemonstrated the high degree of judgment and reliability \nrequired for access to classified information.@4  \n2See, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n3&19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax as required; \n4ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014), reversing Administrative Judge=s favorable \ndecision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0608 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2000)(failure to file for five years). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThis is true whether the failure to file is willful5 or attributed to the press of family \ncircumstances.6 As recently as December 2015, the Appeal Board upheld a denial of \nclearance, in a case notably similar to this, of an applicant who had failed to file Federal \nor state income tax returns for 10 years. \nThe filing of tax returns is both a financial and a legal \nobligation. Applicant=s . . . failure to have done so for many \nyears is sufficient to raise a concern that he may be unwilling \nto follow other rules and regulations, such as those that \ngovern the handling of classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (A person \nwho fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and \nreliability required of those granted access to classified \ninformation). See also Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union \nLocal 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff=d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). Indeed, as the Judge noted, \nDirective, Enclosure 2 & 19(g) explicitly provides that failure \nto file tax returns is a circumstance that can raise a security \nconcern. Moreover, the Directive presumes a nexus between \nadmitted or proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and \nan applicant=s eligibility for a clearance. See. e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 14-04648 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2015). ISCR Case No. \n14-02930 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 9, 2015)7 \nSecurity concerns under Guideline F are not limited to cases in which an Applicant \nis financially insolvent or is experiencing difficulty in paying debts. Indeed, the Appeal \nBoard has ruled that Afailure to file tax returns by itself can be a reason to deny a \nclearance@.8  \nTthe mitigating conditions for financial considerations do not fully apply. His failures \nto timely file his Federal taxes are both recent and multiple, and may not be demonstrated \nto be unlikely to recur.9 He has cited no circumstances that would demonstrate that his \nfailures to file were due to circumstances beyond his control. Certainly, he chose to start \n5See, ISCR Case No. 98-0801 (App. Bd. Jun. 8, 2000)(tax protester). \n6See, ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (App. Bd. Dec. 27, 1999)(routine failure to file). \n7The cases cited by Applicant=s post-hearing brief all involve cases where the failures to timely file occurred \nover three-four years, and none of them has been identified as an Appeal Board case. \n8See, ISCR Case No. 16-03208 (App. Bd. Feb, 28, 2018). \n9&20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that \nit is unlikely to recur . . . \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n Formal Findings \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nseveral new businesses. Moreover, Applicant was not responsible in addressing his \ntaxes. Applicant is an intelligent, well-educated man, with both the skill and experience to \nknow when he should engage professional help. Yet, he did not do so for many years, \nand apparently only when his clearance was at risk.10 However, he appears to have \nsuccessfully resolved his state income tax issues.11 \nThe circumstances of this case do not suggest that Applicant would benefit from \ncredit or financial counseling, but his taxes have been partially resolved to date. 12  \nApplicant has documented what his tax accountant thinks his tax situation is, but there is \nno evidence of the IRS=s view of his taxes.13  Applicant=s tardy contacts with the IRS \ncannot be considered a good-faith effort to address his taxes,14  to the extent that this \nmitigating condition could be considered applicable. Moreover, Applicant had mostly \ndisregarded these tax obligations since at least October 2015, when he missed his first \nextended filing deadline, and again since May 2017, when he discussed his delinquent \ntaxes with a Government investigator. His documented inaction for almost another two \nyearsCuntil April 2019, when he filed the remaining delinquent returnsCraises significant \nsecurity concerns that Applicant has not addressed by the flurry of activity triggered by \nhis receipt of the SOR. And that flurry of activity fails to mitigate Applicant=s overall course \nof conduct, as it cannot overcome my conclusion that Applicant=s track record of at least \nfour years procrastination makes it too soon to conclude that his security-significant \nconduct is behind him. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant. \nParagraph 1. Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs a-d:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs e-g: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs h-j:  \nAgainst Applicant \n10&20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control . . . \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n11&20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file or pay the amount \nowed and is in compliance with those arrangements. \n12&20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications \nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control; \n13The fact that the IRS may not yet have taken action on Applicant=s lately-filed taxes can only be attributed \nto Applicant=s ongoing delays in filing his taxes. \n14&20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                    \n \nConclusion \nUnder the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nClearance denied. \nJohn Grattan Metz, Jr \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

Nagel, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se   \n \n \n09/02/2020 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \n \nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to revoke his eligibility for \naccess to classified information. Although he is now in compliance with federal and \nstate tax authorities, his income-tax problems went on for far too many years to justify \ncomplete mitigation. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non June 3, 2016. (Exhibit 1) This document is commonly known as a security clearance \napplication. He was interviewed as part of a background investigation in May 2018. \n(Exhibit 2) He replied to written interrogatories in March 2019. (Exhibit 2). Thereafter, on \nJuly 26, 2019, after reviewing the application and the information gathered during a \nbackground investigation, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining \nit was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is similar to a complaint. It \n\n \n2 \n \ndetailed the factual reasons for the action under the security guideline known as \nGuideline F for financial considerations.   \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 20, 2019. In a one-page memorandum, \nhe admitted the allegations concerning failure to timely file state and federal income tax \nreturns for tax years 2012-2017. He also admitted failure to timely pay federal and state \nincome taxes for the same tax years as well as an indebtedness to both federal and \nstate tax authorities. And he requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  \n \nThe case was assigned to me on September 30, 2019. The hearing took place \nas scheduled on December 3, 2019. Applicant appeared without counsel. Department \nCounsel offered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 1-6. Applicant \noffered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits A-B. Other than \nApplicant, no witnesses were called. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on \nDecember 13, 2019.  \n \nThe record was kept open until December 31, 2019, to provide Applicant an \nopportunity to present additional documentation. Those matters were timely received \nand they (along with the accompanying e-mails) are admitted without objections as \nExhibits C-E.     \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security \nclearance. (Tr. 5) He is employed as a manufacturing technician for a large company in \nthe defense industry. He was initially hired as a custodian and was subsequently \npromoted to his current job. He has worked for this company since 2009. He expected \nto earn a gross income of about $55,000 for 2019. (Tr. 38-39) He has a good \nemployment record and is considered a skilled and reliable employee per three letters \nof recommendation. (Exhibit E) He has held a security clearance without incident since \n2009. His educational background includes a high school diploma and some college. He \nhas never married, but he lives with the mother of his child.  \n \nThe SOR concerns a history of income-tax problems as follows: (1) failure to \ntimely file state and federal income tax returns for tax years 2012-2017; (2) failure to \ntimely pay state and federal income tax for tax years 2012-2017; (3) back taxes owed to \nthe IRS in the amount of $18,440; and (4) back taxes owed to the state tax authority in \nthe amount of $2,776. Applicant does not dispute or contest the allegations. He \ndisclosed his income-tax problems when he completed his 2016 security clearance \napplication, and he provided additional information during the security clearance \nprocess. (Exhibits 1 and 2)  \n \nApplicant attributed his income-tax problems to being \u201cyoung and dumb\u201d and \nrelying on information he received from a friend of a friend of a friend during a social \nevent sometime in 2012. (Tr. 30-35) He explained this person showed him and others a \ndocument that purported to state that then President Obama had declared that any \ntaxpayer who earned less than $50,000 annually no longer had an obligation to file a tax \n\n \n3 \n \nreturn. Applicant believed the document was authentic and thought it was a good deal. \nAccordingly, although he had previously filed tax returns, he decided to not file federal \nor state income tax returns beginning with tax year 2012. He assumed the presidential \ndeclaration applied to state income-tax matters too.  \n \nAfter the conclusion of tax year 2015 (early 2016), Applicant was earning more \nthan $50,000, he realized that he owed a lot in tax, he panicked, and he failed to take \nany remedial action. Although he disclosed his income-tax problems in his June 2016 \nsecurity clearance application, he did not take remedial action because he was scared. \n(Tr. 43) He reported (by telephone) his income-tax problems to his company\u2019s facility \nsecurity officer (FSO) sometime in 2016 after completing his security clearance \napplication. (Tr. 53-55)  \n \nApplicant is now in compliance with both federal and state tax authorities. He met \nwith an attorney to address the matter, but decided that avenue was too expensive. Tr. \n45) With the assistance of an accountant, he filed federal and state income tax returns \nfor tax years 2012-2018 in March 2019. Going forward, he intends to continue using the \nservices of the accountant, who spent about a half an hour yelling at and scolding him. \n(Tr. 57-58)  \n \nConcerning the state income-tax indebtedness, Applicant entered into a payment \nplan to pay the delinquent tax liabilities on July 2, 2019, and satisfied the plan on August \n12, 2019. (Exhibit A) He borrowed money from family and friends to do so, and he is in \nthe process of repaying those people. (Tr. 56-57) He is in receipt of a certificate of good \nstanding from the state tax authority verifying that he has filed and paid all taxes due. \n(Exhibit D) \n \nConcerning the federal income-tax indebtedness, in August 2019, Applicant \nentered into an installment agreement with the IRS to have a monthly payment of $400 \nautomatically deducted from his checking account beginning October 10, 2019. (Exhibit \nB) The installment agreement covers back taxes for tax years 2012-2018. Applicant \nestimated he owed the IRS about $18,440 in his response to written interrogatories. \n(Exhibit 2) At hearing, his estimate was $25,000 to $30,000, which includes interest and \npenalties. (Tr. 46-47, 55) In addition to the installment agreement, Applicant has had \nmaximum withholding of federal income tax (zero deductions) from his wages since \nFebruary 2019, and he expected the IRS to withhold his 2019 tax refund. (Tr. 47-48)   \n \nAt hearing, Applicant took complete responsibility for his income-tax problems, \nand he did not attempt to minimize the issue. I found his testimony to be heartfelt and \nsincere. He acknowledged past mistakes, but believes that he has changed due to his \nobligation to set a good example for his 11-year-old son. He loves his job, feels great \nembarrassment due to his income-tax problems, and pledged that similar problems will \nnot recur.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \n \n                                                          \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income \ntax as required; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.  \n \n \nApplicant has made progress in resolving the income-tax matters, and he is now \nin compliance with both federal and state tax authorities. That means he filed all tax \nreturns, as required; he paid all taxes due to the state tax authority, as required; and he \nentered into an installment agreement with the IRS to pay back taxes owed for multiple \ntax years, with the first payment in October 2019. He did a decent job documenting his \ncompliance.  \n \n \nIn addressing this issue, I note that an applicant\u2019s failure to timely file tax returns \nand pay tax when due bears close examination and is a matter of serious concern to the \nfederal government. The DOHA Appeal Board has made it clear that an applicant who \nfails repeatedly to fulfill their legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying tax \nwhen due, does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability \nrequired of those granted access to classified information. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n06707 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 15, 2017).  \n \n \nHere, I am concerned about the duration of Applicant\u2019s income-tax problems and \nthe timing of his remedial action. Both are questions of fact that must be addressed. \n\n \n6 \n \nApplicant failed to timely file state and federal income tax returns for six tax years. He \ndid so by relying on bogus information received from a person he met on a single \noccasion at a social event. He then compounded the problem a few years later by \npanicking and neglecting to take remedial action. Although I am persuaded that \nApplicant was not a tax protestor nor tax defiant, he was exceptionally gullible, na\u00efve, \nand lax concerning his income-tax obligations.    \n \n \nTo his credit, Applicant disclosed his income-tax problems in his 2016 security \nclearance application, and he provided additional information during the security \nclearance process. He finally took remedial action in 2019, beginning with the filing of \ntax returns in March 2019. He has been in compliance for a relatively brief period of \ntime compared with the time of noncompliance. He\u2019s in the beginning stages of an \ninstallment agreement with the IRS. He owes a sizeable sum of back taxes that will take \nseveral years to repay. Considering the totality of facts and circumstances, it is far too \nsoon to tell if he will continue to meet his income-tax obligations on a timely basis. \nAccordingly, the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(g) applies, but the evidence is not \nsufficient to justify complete mitigation of his long-standing irresponsibility in failing to \nmeet his legal obligations.    \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he \nhas not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a -- 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

No IRS tax lien was filed against her, as \nerroneously alleged in the SOR. A state tax lien filed jointly against her for her ex-\nhusband\u2019s debt was fully satisfied, and was released in 2017. After their divorce, Applicant \nworked with a certified public accountant (CPA) to resolve all of her tax issues and her \nfinancial situation has stabilized. Based upon evaluation of the testimony, pleadings, and \nexhibits, trustworthiness concerns are mitigated and national security eligibility to occupy \na designated sensitive position is granted.   \n \nHistory of Case \n \nOn June 13, 2017, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On January 18, 2019, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). \nThe action was taken under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \n\n \n \n \n \n2 \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017, as \npromulgated in Appendix A of SEAD 4. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 26, 2019 (Answer), and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) assigned the case to another administrative judge on June 25, 2019. \nDue to Applicant\u2019s cross-country relocation for assignment to work on a different contract, \nthe case was reassigned to me on August 6, 2019. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on \nAugust 27, 2019, setting the hearing for September 11, 2019. Due to an unforeseeable \nmedical emergency, not involving Applicant, the hearing was continued until November \n8, 2019. On that date, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through \n6 into evidence. Applicant testified, and offered Exhibits (AE) A through G into evidence. \nAll exhibits were admitted without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to leave the \nrecord open until January 15, 2020, to permit submission of additional evidence. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on November 20 2019. Applicant timely submitted \nseveral additional documents, which were admitted into evidence, without objection, as \nAE H through N, and the record closed as scheduled.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 44 years old, and has one adult child. Her two marriages ended in \ndivorce, most recently in 2013. She graduated from high school in 1994, and has \ncompleted some college coursework. She applied for a trustworthiness determination in \nconnection with starting her DoD contract work in May 2017 as a training specialist, and \nlater a functional analyst, with expertise in electronic medical records. She has never \nserved in the military or worked in the Federal civil service. (GE 1; Tr. 7, 9, 54-58.) \n \n \nApplicant married her first husband in October 1993, when they were both 17 years \nold and high school students. Their daughter was born two months later. Their marriage \nended in divorce in January 1997. Applicant married her second husband in June 2002, \nwhile he was employed as the service manager at a luxury car dealership. Four months \nlater, although performing well, he was fired by the manager of the dealership who was \nlater replaced when ownership realized that the manager was the problem. Her husband \nwas rehired, but had begun suffering depression from which he never recovered. Their \nfamily finances were adversely impacted by this, and he refused to cooperate in filing \ntheir Federal or state income tax returns for the duration of their marriage. (AR; GE 1; GE \n2; GE 3; AE F; Tr. 58-60.) \n \n \nAfter moving to another state for new employment opportunities, Applicant\u2019s \nfamily\u2019s financial struggles continued. Over her increasingly strenuous objections, \nApplicant\u2019s husband continued his refusal to address their tax filing obligations, which \ncaused ongoing friction. In 2010, Applicant decided that she could no longer suborn her \ndesire to live responsibly to her husband\u2019s bad choices, so she returned home to live with \nher brother and help him during his recovery from a kidney transplant, with financial \nsupport from their sister. (Answer; GE 2; GE 3; AE F; Tr. 51-52, 60-67.)      \n\n \n \n \n \n3 \n \nApplicant found employment in the health care industry, in July 2011, working to \nconvert from paper to electronic medical records for a company. Although her job did not \npay well, she gained valuable knowledge and experience. From 2012 to 2016, she lived \nfrugally while paying for her daughter to attend college. In 2015, she began treatment with \na psychologist for her diagnosed attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which she has \nsince successfully continued. She parlayed her electronic medical records expertise into \nseveral consulting contracts before being hired into her current position. (Answer; GE 2; \nGE 3; AE F; AE M; Tr. 67-75.) \n \n \nIn December 2017, Applicant was financially stable enough to consult and hire a \nCPA to help resolve her outstanding tax issues. Applicant began this successful \ncorrective course of action more than a year before the DoD CAF issued the SOR in this \ncase. (Tr. 51-52, 76-77, 103-104.) \n \n \nThe CPA initially helped Applicant to file her state and Federal returns for tax years \n2011 through 2015, and 2017. Applicant contemporaneously paid all outstanding \nassociated taxes. They were unable at the time to file Applicant\u2019s 2016 returns, due to \nerroneous income reporting by her former employer, but finally resolved that issue in \n2019. Her CPA also began researching records to permit resolution of outstanding tax \nissues for 2003 through 2010. The CPA determined that, since Applicant did not earn any \nincome during 2008 through 2010, she was not required to file or pay any taxes for those \nyears. They subsequently obtained documentation to permit Applicant to file and resolve \nher state and Federal taxes for 2007, but they were unable to obtain documentation for \n2004 through 2006. Applicant\u2019s 2003 taxes were actually filed and paid on time, but that \nyear was erroneously included in the SOR allegation based on a mistake during her OPM \ninterview. Applicant timely filed and paid her 2018 taxes, and provided documentation \nfrom the IRS and her state tax authority detailing that all of her taxes are fully paid, with \nnothing owed to either. (Answer; GE 2; GE 3; AE A; AE C; AE D; AE E; AE H; AE J; AE \nK; AE N; Tr. 76-89.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged the entry of an IRS tax lien against Applicant in 2018, again \nbased on erroneous information recorded by the OPM investigator concerning Applicant\u2019s \ninterview. Applicant told the investigator that she had recently received notice from her \nstate revenue department that part of her state tax refund would be applied toward a lien \nfiled against her former husband for a tax year during which they were married, and for \nwhich she was considered to be jointly liable. Applicant\u2019s payment satisfied this lien, which \nwas then removed. As noted above, she documented that she has satisfied and resolved \nall of her state and Federal tax issues. (GE 3; Tr. 52-53, 89-94.) \n \n \nApplicant provided a personal financial statement demonstrating sufficient income \nto cover her regular living expenses and debt payments, with a substantial monthly \nremainder. Her most recent credit report lists no delinquent debts, and shows that her \nfour active accounts have been paid as agreed. (AE B; GE 6.) In addition to working with \nher CPA to resolve all tax issues, she recently completed a nine-lesson financial \nmanagement course. (AE I; Tr. 95-96.) \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4 \n \nApplicant\u2019s older sister and her longtime family physician wrote lengthy letters \ndescribing her ultimately successful efforts to manage and overcome her difficult marital, \nfamily, and health challenges. They also discussed her lifelong integrity and good \ncharacter, from which her tax issues with her ex-husband were an aberration. (AE F.) \nEleven professional colleagues and supervisors from her most recent several years of \nemployment described their high opinions of her responsibility, trustworthiness, judgment, \nand honesty. They further noted her commitment to following and enforcing rules and \nprocedures for the proper maintenance of electronic medical records, and her unselfish \nefforts to share her expertise while training and developing those around her. (AE G.) Her \nbearing and demeanor during her hearing displayed her forthright acceptance of her past \nproblems and her determination to continue her more recent pattern of responsible and \naccountable conduct. (Tr.)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list potentially disqualifying conditions \nand mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Pursuant to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \n\n \n \n \n \n5 \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive or \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of information compromise.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe trustworthiness concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations \nare set out in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes one condition that could raise trustworthiness concerns and \nmay be disqualifying in this case:  \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \n \nApplicant and her ex-husband failed to timely file some required Federal and state \nincome tax returns between 2004 and 2016. These facts establish prima facie support for \nthe foregoing disqualifying condition, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate the \nresulting security concerns. The SOR allegations that she had an outstanding tax lien, \nand that she failed to file required Federal and state returns for tax years 2003 and 2008 \nthrough 2010, are not true. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 includes three conditions that fully mitigate the trustworthiness concerns \narising from Applicant\u2019s former financial difficulties:  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n\n \n \n \n \n6 \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nDue to marital issues with her ex-husband, and despite her best efforts under the \ncircumstances including her post-separation financial straits, Applicant was unable to \ntimely prepare and file tax returns for 2004 to 2007 and 2011 to 2016. She addressed this \nsituation, starting in 2016 when she obtained steady employment, by hiring the CPA to \nobtain the required information and file the delinquent returns. All formerly unfiled tax \nobligations have been fully resolved to the documented satisfaction of state and Federal \ntax authorities. Applicant completed a formal course of financial counselling, her financial \nsituation is comfortably solvent, and there is minimal future risk of financial stress or tax-\nfiling issues. These actions establish complete mitigation of trustworthiness concerns \nraised by Applicant\u2019s formerly delinquent tax returns.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult, who \nhas demonstrated accountability for resolving the tax return filing issues that she and her \nhusband formerly encountered. She, working with her CPA, has now filed all of the \nformerly delinquent returns for which source documents could be retrieved, and paid all \napplicable taxes. The failure to file timely returns did not, in this case, arise from or reflect \n\n \n \n \n \n7 \nirresponsibility, untrustworthiness, or unwillingness to comply with laws and regulations \non Applicant\u2019s part. She demonstrated strong character and has devoted herself to \nresolution of these issues independent of her job-necessitated application for a \ntrustworthiness determination. Applicant proved that she has sufficient income security to \nensure solvency in the future, and evinced her commitment to timely comply with all tax \nand information security obligations. The potential for pressure, exploitation, or duress is \nminimal.  \n \nOverall, the evidence has eliminated any doubt as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for \nnational security eligibility. She successfully met her burden to mitigate the \ntrustworthiness concerns arising under the guideline for financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d:   \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant national security \neligibility. National security eligibility to occupy a designated sensitive position is granted. \n \n \n                                      \n     \n \n \n \n \n \nDAVID M.

She was \nemployed in a similar position from October 2006 to April 2010, when she left because of \nemployment discrimination related to her medical issues, and from November 2010 to \nJune 2014, when she left voluntarily Thus, she was unemployed with medical issues April-\nNovember 2010, and voluntarily from June 2014 to August 2015.. Applicant has never \nmarried, and has a 15-year old son. She has not previously held a clearance, although \nshe discovered as part of this clearance process that a previous employer had submitted \na clearance request that had not been processed before she left that employment. \nThe SOR alleges, and GE 1-5 substantiate, 27 delinquent debts totaling almost \n$44,000. Applicant admits 13 debts totaling almost $27,000. Applicant reported one \nresolved debtCnot at issue in the SORCon her September 2015 clearance application \n(GE 1), but failed to report the remaining debts, resulting in the falsification allegation. \nShe was confronted with these debts, and discussed them, during subject interviews with \na Government investigator on 15 October 2015, 2 March 2016, and 16 May 2016 (GE 2), \nbased on her September 2015 credit report (GE 3). She asserted that she was unaware \nof these debts until she was confronted by the investigator. \nApplicant=s debt denials appear to be related to the fact that SOR debts 1.a and \n1.c do not appear on the three February 2019 credit reports she submitted with her \nAnswer, a claimed, but not documented, dispute with the SOR 1.o creditor, and her claim \nthat SOR 1.q-1.aa debts were resolved. She also claimed to be working on a settlement \namount with the SOR 1.k creditor, without corroboration. \nThe delinquent debts comprise an $18,769 automobile debt (SOR 1.k), 15 \ndelinquent medical debts totaling $9,053 (SOR 1.a-1.h, 1.t, and 1.v-1.aa), and 11 \ndelinquent consumer credit accounts (SOR 1.i-1.j, and 1.l-1.s and 1.u). Applicant=s \nAnswer included February 2019 debt validation letters to each of the creditors for the \nadmitted debts, except for the automobile loan at SOR 1.k. However, the letters were \ngeneric, not identifying the dates of the derogatory credit reports, any account balances, \naccount numbers, or previous creditors. She sent no letters to any of the creditors for the \ndebts she denied. \nOf the 15 medical debts alleged (SOR 1.a-1.h, 1.t, and 1.v-1.aa), 13 were for the \nsame medical provider and held by the same creditor (SOR 1.b-1.h, 1.t, and 1.w-1.aa). \nDuring her subject interviews, she acknowledged that she received the medical treatment \nrecorded, but asserted that she either had insurance to cover the bill or was receiving \ncoverage through the state. Nevertheless, she stated that she would investigate the debts \nand pay any balance owed. She claimed, without corroboration, that the amount alleged \nin SOR debt 1.k was incorrect, and that she was working with the creditor to arrange a \nrepayment plan. She generally acknowledged the non-medical debts, stating specifically \nthat she planned to pay SOR debt 1.i within the next six months, would pay SOR debt \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1.m within the next 6-12 months, and had her father pay SOR debt 1.n. She asserted that \nSOR debt 1.o was fraud by a former roommate. However, her father had not paid SOR \ndebt 1.n, and she took no documented action on any of the debts she discussed with the \ninvestigator. \nApplicant=s February 2019 creditor letters garnered some responses from the \ncreditors. On 25 April 2019, Applicant settled SOR debts 1.b-1.hCincluding the SOR 1.c \ndebt that she had previously deniedCat a 50% discount (AE A). On 15 March 2019, the \nSOR 1.i collection agent stated that it was ceasing collection on the account and would \nhave it removed from her credit file, despite Applicant having previously admitted this debt \n(AE B). On 24 April 2019, Applicant settled SOR debt 1.j at a one-third discount (AE C). \nIn February 2019, Applicant documented some sporadic payments on the automobile \nloan at SOR 1.k between July 2016 and November 2018, along with a two-payment \nsettlement amount at a substantial discount, due in late May and late June 2019 (AE D). \nIn April 2019, the SOR 1.l creditor agreed to accept $800 in settlement of the debt, now \ngrown to over $2,500; Applicant provided a copy of a May 2019 check for that amount, \npayable to the creditor (AE E). In March 2019, the SOR 1.m collection agent stated that \nit had stopped collection action on the account, but would continue to report any account \nactivity to the credit bureaus (AE F). On 23 April 2019, the SOR 1.n creditor reported that \nApplicant had completed a settlement payment at a 40% discount (AE G). Applicant \nreceived no response from the SOR debt 1.p collection agent, but provided a March 2019 \nupdate from a credit bureau reflecting that the collection agent was removing the account \nfrom Applicant=s credit report (AE H). Applicant also documented some efforts to locate \nthe SOR 1.v (AE I) and SOR 1.w (AE J) collection agents, two medical debts Applicant \ndenied as having been resolved. \nApplicant=s testimony generally followed her exhibits. She testified that she could \nnot find the SOR 1.a creditor, was disputing the SOR 1.o debt as fraud by a former \nroommate, and that the SOR 1.q-1.s creditor had no record of any debts in her name. \nHowever, she corroborated none of these claims (Tr. 29). She stated that SOR debts 1.t-\n1.u (not a medical bill) and 1.x-1.aa were all held by the same collection agent as SOR \ndebts 1.b-1.h, and the collection agent had stated that SOR debts 1.b-1.h were the only \ndebts held by that agency. Applicant claimed, again without corroboration, that she paid \nthese debts in 2015 after her interview (Tr. 31, AE A). \nApplicant attributed her financial problems to her unemployment periods, whether \nvoluntary or not, her son=s father=s sporadic payment of child support, and her mother=s \ndeath in 2012, followed in regular order by the deaths of other family and near-family \nmembers. She also stated that when her living arrangements changed, her son=s father \nand other roommates did not always forward her mail. \nApplicant testified that she has $600-700 positive monthly cash flow, and her \ncurrent job provides health insurance (Tr. 59-62). However, she did not provide any \nbudget. Moreover, she did not provide any evidence of any financial or credit counseling \nshe may have received. She provided no work or character references, or any evidence \nof community involvement. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nPolicies \nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person=s suitability for \naccess to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented. \nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG & 2(a). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself, \nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the \nrelevant adjudicative guideline are Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline \nE (Personal Conduct). \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant=s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government=s case. \nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden \nof persuasion. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. \nThe Aclearly consistent with the national interest@ standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant=s suitability for access in favor of the Government.2 \nAnalysis \nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and \nApplicant failed to fully mitigate the security concerns. Applicant acquired significant debt \nfor a variety of reasons, some beyond her control, some not. She did not corroborate her \nclaims that she resolved many of her debts after she became aware of them in 2015, and \nthose debts may have aged off her credit reports. The debt resolutions she has \ndocumented were only undertaken after she received the SOR, more than three years \nafter she became aware of them.3  \nApplicant only partially meets the mitigating factors for financial considerations. \nHer financial difficulties are both recent and multiple, and ongoing; so they cannot be \n2See, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n3&19(a) inability to satisfy debts; (b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; (c) a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsidered unlikely to recur.4  Some of her debts were due to circumstances beyond her \ncontrol, and but while her claimed efforts in 2015 might constitute dealing with the debt \nresponsibly (if better documented), the fact that she did not address nearly half the SOR \ndebts until after she received the SOR means that these debts cannot be considered to \nhave been responsibly addressed.5  \nSimilarly, her belated efforts to address only the debts she admitted undercuts any \nclaim of reformed financial habits. The Government is not the collection agent of last \nresort. Applicants are expected to deal with their finances responsibly regardless of the \nGovernment=s interest. Applicant provided no evidence of credit or financial counseling, \nor a budget to address her current financial situation; so I cannot conclude that her \nfinancial problems are behind her.6  Moreover, belated efforts to pay her debts belies a \ngood-faith effort to satisfy her debts.7  \nThe Appeal Board has stated that an Applicant need not have paid every debt \nalleged in the SOR, need not pay the SOR debts first, and need not be paying on all debts \nsimultaneously. Applicant need only establish that there is a credible and realistic plan to \nresolve the financial problems, accompanied by significant actions to implement the plan.8  \nApplicant=s belated efforts do not constitute such a plan. Moreover, there is no Awhole \nperson@ evidence to support a Awhole-person@ analysis arguing for granting her clearance \nnotwithstanding her financial issues. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant. \nThe Government did not establish a case for disqualification under Guideline E. I \naccept her testimony that she reported the one debt she knew about on her clearance \napplication, and only became aware of the SOR debts, when she was confronted with \nthem during her interviews. I conclude Guideline E for Applicant. \n4&20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that \nit is unlikely to recur . . . \n5&20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control . . . \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n6&20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications \nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control; \n7&20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n8ISCR Case No. 07-06482 (App. Bd. 21 May 2008). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1.

In August 2013, \nApplicant was hospitalized due to various medical issues. At that time, she was employed \nand had health insurance. After she left the hospital, her employer gave her a urinalysis, \nwhich she failed, and she was fired. Since she moved to State A in 2014, she has helped \ncare for her mother, who has dementia. Additionally, in the past five years, Applicant was \nhomeless twice, when family members kicked her out of their homes. Though she \nappeared at her hearing pro se, Applicant initially hired an attorney to represent her during \nthe adjudication of her security clearance. She paid him over $1,300, which caused her \nto fall behind on additional financial obligations, including her car payment, which was \nrepossessed in May 2019.  (GE 1; GE 6; GE 7; GE 8; GE 9; Tr. 30-43, 45, 48-49, 57) \n \nApplicant submitted a July 2019 letter indicating her personal information may \nhave been compromised; however, she provided no direct information that any of the \nalleged debts were invalid and were placed for collection during the period of the security \nbreach. (AE D) \n \nApplicant\u2019s tax issues started in 1989. She filed her state and federal income tax \nreturns, but was unable to pay her tax obligations. She filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy \nprotection in 1993, and her debts, other than her taxes, were discharged in 1994. In 2002, \nApplicant learned that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had filed a $29,000 lien against \nher. Two years later, she entered into a monthly installment agreement with the IRS, \nwhich she paid until 2010, when she was placed in a non-collectible status. The last time \nApplicant filed her state and federal tax returns was in 2012. In 2014, she moved to State \nB, which does not have income taxes, and she stopped communicating with the IRS. \nApplicant continues to owe State A $6,304 for the two tax liens filed against her in 2008 \nand the one lien filed in 2013. Applicant initially testified that she owes the IRS \n\n \n3 \n \napproximately $18,000 for tax years 2002 to present; however, later in the hearing, she \nclaimed that she has overpaid her federal income taxes and is due a refund of \napproximately $10,000. (GE 1 at 41-43; GE 2; GE 3; GE 4; GE 5; GE 6 at 5; GE 9; Tr. \n40-41, 50-58, 65-66) \n \nA week before the hearing, Applicant hired a tax-service company to investigate \nthe status of her 1990 through 2018 state and federal income taxes. As of the date of the \nhearing, Applicant had not paid the $495 to retain the tax-service company, nor did she \nprovide proof of payment in her post-hearing documentation. She testified that State A \nput her in a hardship-deferral for her three state tax liens, but she did not provide \ndocumentation to support this claim, nor did she provide specifics as to when the deferral \nwas granted. Additionally, after the hearing Applicant asserted that State A was \ninvestigating the three liens, and she had agreed to set up a payment plan to begin in \nDecember 2019. She provided no documentation to support this claim. (AE A; AE F; AE \nG; Tr. 57-61) \n \nIn 2017, Applicant hired a credit-repair company to dispute and remove negative \nitems from her credit reports. The company did not make payments to her various \ncreditors. Applicant worked with the company until a month before the hearing, because \nshe could no longer pay the $119 monthly fee. She testified that some of her debts were \nresolved by the repair program, but because she was no longer paying the company, she \ndid not have access to information regarding which debts had been resolved through \ndispute. At the hearing, she could not identify which SOR allegations were removed from \nher CBR. (Tr. 45-48, 69-71)  \n \nIn her post-hearing documentation, Applicant claimed that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, and \n1.l through 1.y were all resolved through dispute or no longer appeared on her credit \nreport. However, she did not provide a copy of an updated CBR to substantiate her claims. \nAdditionally, the May 2019 documentation from the credit-repair company listed fourteen \ndebts that were deleted from her credit file, but only SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.q, 1.r, and 1.s were \nidentifiable. The documentation also indicated that Applicant had eight new negative \nitems in her credit file, of which SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g were identifiable. The credit-repair \ncompany documentation did not indicate the basis for which the negative items were \nremoved from Applicant\u2019s credit file. (AE F; AE G) \n \nIn March 2011, Applicant was awarded primary custody of her niece, who has \ncerebral palsy, due to her sister\u2019s need for substance-abuse treatment. The guardianship \narrangement lasted for one year. She testified that some of her niece\u2019s medical bills were \nplaced for collection in her name, including SOR \u00b6 1.e. Applicant called the creditor a year \nbefore the hearing, but was advised by her credit-repair program to not contact the \ncreditor again as the company was trying to resolve this debt. According to her post-\nhearing documentation, this debt was disputed and removed from her credit report. (AE \nF; Tr. 45-46) \n \nBased upon the information reported in her CBRs, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i appear to \nbe duplicates of each other. In her post-hearing documentation, Applicant claimed for the \n\n \n4 \n \nfirst time that SOR \u00b61.f. is a duplicate of SOR \u00b6 1.g. However, the debts have different \naccount numbers and different balances. (GE 4; GE 5; AE F) \n \nApplicant has not made payments toward any of the debts alleged in the SOR. As \nof the date of the hearing, she was not following a written budget due to her \nunemployment. However, she has followed one in the past. (Tr. 67)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s 2010 SCA and credit bureau report (CBR) reflect numerous delinquent \ndebts. She had vehicles repossessed in October 2011, October 2014, and May 2019. \nAdditionally, she has four high-interest personal loans that have become delinquent in the \npast year. She owes additional money for back rent at a former apartment. The \nrepossessions and delinquent personal loans are not alleged in the SOR. (GE 5; GE 6 at \n2, 6; AE B; AE C; Tr. 25-26, 72-74, 79-81) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \n \n \nThe record evidence of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts, tax liens, and unfiled tax \nreturns establish three disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant has not filed her state and federal income tax returns for tax years 2013 \nand 2014. She has failed to resolve three tax liens totaling $6,304. Her federal income \ntaxes have been an issue since at least 2002, when the IRS filed a $29,000 lien against \nher. She testified that she made payments for several years, but discontinued all \ncommunication with the IRS in 2012.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to timely file her federal income tax returns for tax years 2015 \nthrough 2018 was not alleged in the SOR, and these tax years were not considered in \ndetermining if the disqualifying conditions were applicable. However, her ongoing failure \nto file her returns and pay her taxes, within her lengthy history of tax problems, raise \nadditional questions regarding her judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Finally, there \nis no record evidence that Applicant has made arrangements with the IRS or State A to \nfile or pay her past-due taxes. \n \nApplicant hired a credit-repair company in 2017 to dispute and resolve the negative \nitems reported in her credit reports. This company did not make payment arrangements \nwith the creditors. Applicant\u2019s documentation does not clearly establish the grounds and \n\n \n7 \n \nlegitimacy for her disputes. Based upon her consistent account that SOR \u00b6 1.e was her \nniece\u2019s medical debt, I have accepted that this debt was resolved through dispute. \nAdditionally, the documentary evidence indicates SOR \u00b6 1.i is a duplicate of SOR \u00b6 1.h. \nAs such, it is resolved for Applicant. However, the remainder of the disputed debts remain \nunresolved and unmitigated. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues continue to be an ongoing concern. During the course \nof the hearing, she admitted to several significant additional delinquent debts that were \nnot alleged in the SOR. These debts demonstrate that the behavior was recent, frequent, \nand recurring.  \n \nFinally, although Applicant has experienced many life events that negatively \naffected her finances, she failed to demonstrate that she has acted responsibly to address \nher delinquent debts. Mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), 20(e), and 20(g) \nwas not established.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis.  \n \nI conclude Applicant has not met her burden of proof and persuasion. She did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns or establish her eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n\n \n8 \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.h: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j-1.y: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of \nthe United States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n__________________________ \nCAROLINE E. HEINTZELMAN \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

Berry, Esq. \n01/08/2020\n___________ \nDecision  \n___________ \nHARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: \nFrom about 2012 to 2014, Applicant solicited prostitutes five or six times while he \nheld a security clearance. Sexual behavior and personal conduct security concerns are \nnot mitigated. Access to classified information is denied.    \nStatement of the Case \nOn February 2, 2018, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit \n(GE) 1) On May 24, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Executive Order \n(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, \n1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nestablishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AGs), effective June 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2)  \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \nwhether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. Specifically, the \nSOR set forth security concerns arising under Guidelines D (sexual behavior) and E \n\n \n2 \n                                         \n \n(personal conduct).

On September 9, \n2019, the case was assigned to me. On September 17, 2019, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for \nNovember 20, 2019. (HE 1) Applicant\u2019s hearing was held as scheduled.  \n  \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered eight exhibits; Applicant offered \nfive exhibits; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. (Tr. 14-18, 26-27; GE \n1-8; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-AE E). Applicant provided documents to complete two \nexhibits after his hearing.

(Tr. 18; \nGE 1) He received one master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering and computer \nengineering, and a second master\u2019s degree in networks and computer security. (Tr. 18; \nGE 1) \n \nSexual Behavior and Personal Conduct \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.a allege from about 2012 to 2014, while granted access to \nclassified information, Applicant solicited prostitutes about six times. Applicant said he \nsolicited prostitutes five or six times. (Tr. 20)  \n \nApplicant had a lengthy career performing numerous high-risk missions acting in \na covert capacity on behalf of a non-DOD agency, which will be referred to as another \ngovernment agency (AGA). (Tr. 22) While on close-contact sensitive classified missions \noutside the United States on behalf of an AGA, Applicant befriended and deceived foreign \nnationals and U.S. citizens. (Tr. 21, 23; AE A at 5) He was successful at exploiting others \n\n \n3 \n                                         \n \nin support of the mission. (Tr. 21) Applicant believed he was not psychologically equipped \nor trained for such missions. (Tr. 21) He was psychologically \u201cover his head\u201d because of \nthe circumstances of the missions. (Tr. 57) He was taking AndroGel, a medication which \nincreased his libido and aggressiveness, and he believed, AndroGel adversely affected \nor contributed to his decisions to seek sexual release from prostitutes. (Tr. 23-25, 57) \nAndroGel was part of his high-dosage testosterone therapy and was prescribed by his \nphysician. (Tr. 70; AE A at 5) His dose of AndroGel was reduced by half after his last \ninvolvement with a prostitute in 2014. (Tr. 26) His medication does not currently affect his \njudgment. (Tr. 35) \n \nFrom 2012 to 2014, Applicant held a security clearance with access to SCI. (Tr. \n35-36) Applicant engaged in sexual intercourse with the prostitutes while he was on solo \nmissions without proper psychological support. (Tr. 24-25) He was \u201cembedding himself \ninto organizations and getting to know people and deceiving them.\u201d (Tr. 39) He did not \nhave anyone on his team to address his concerns and issues. (Tr. 24) He described his \nbehavior with prostitutes as a \u201ccatastrophic personal failure\u201d and as \u201ctotally unacceptable.\u201d \n(Tr. 24-25, 33, 58) He did not engage in sexual activity with prostitutes before 2012 or \nafter 2014. (Tr. 26, 34, 57)  \n \nThe prostitutes in the foreign country worked in licensed bordellos, and Applicant\u2019s \nengaging in sex with them for money was not a crime. (Tr. 25) He did not consume alcohol \nbefore going to the bordellos. (Tr. 52) He went to different bordellos sometimes in different \ncities. (Tr. 48, 51) The AGA knew what city Applicant was located in; however, the AGA \ndid not know when he went to a bordello. (Tr. 49) Applicant paid the prostitutes with cash, \nand the prostitutes did not know his name. (Tr. 25, 44-45, 55-56) He believed he paid \nabout $100 each time. (Tr. 54-55) He did not bring identification documents to the \nbordello. (Tr. 53) He engaged in sexual intercourse with the prostitutes in the bordello, \nand he used a condom. (Tr. 47, 50, 55, 78) He assumed the women in the bordello were \nold enough to be legally authorized to engage in such conduct in the foreign country \nwhere he engaged in sex with them. (Tr. 77) He suggested that the bordello would not be \nlicensed by the foreign government without ensuring the women engaging in sex were \nnot minors. He did not know the nationality of the prostitutes. (Tr. 46, 49, 53-54) He \ndescribed the sex with the prostitutes as \u201cthe release to keep myself sane\u201d and to maintain \nhis \u201cbalance.\u201d (Tr. 58, 69, 78)  \n \nWhen Applicant was on an overseas mission, he maintained security. He \nconceded his conduct with prostitutes while on a mission was \u201cextremely risky.\u201d (Tr. 51) \nHe denied that he engaged in any conversation with the prostitutes. (Tr. 48, 50) He said: \n \nI talk to no one. There\u2019s no reason to talk to anyone. Everyone\u2019s a threat. \nAny conversation with anyone \u2013 in the plane on the street \u2013 it all represents \na threat. There\u2019s no reason to talk to anybody about anything. I mean, when \nI was doing these things, I was completely isolated socially, other than the \npeople that I was deceiving -- (Tr. 47-48) \n \n*  *  * \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \nAgain, for each one of these missions, it was isolation. Again, everyone \nrepresents a threat. Every person. It\u2019s just the shopkeeper. There\u2019s no \nsense in engaging in conversations with anyone. You engage in a \nconversation with someone normally, and then all of a sudden it\u2019s, well, \nwhy are you here? And then, what are you doing? Or, what\u2019s the nature of \nyour business? And there\u2019s no good that comes from any of those \nconversations. (Tr. 50)   \n \nApplicant conceded, \u201cI admit fully, without reservation, that I put myself at risk, I put the \nmission at risk, and it was wrong.\u201d (Tr. 62) His missions on behalf of the AGA were \nsuccessfully accomplished notwithstanding Applicant\u2019s involvement with prostitutes. (Tr. \n21, 25, 35, 75) \n \nApplicant was supposed to report to the AGA occasions when he was stopped or \ndetained going to or exiting a place or any problems. (Tr. 60) He disclosed operational \nerrors because they put the mission and lives at risk. (Tr. 79) The first time Applicant \ndisclosed his involvement with prostitutes was in May 2017 before he took an AGA \npolygraph test. (Tr. 36-37, 79; GE 4; GE 5) He believes he passed the polygraph test \nadministered after his disclosures about his involvement with prostitutes. (Tr. 80) He said \nhe did not disclose his involvement with prostitutes before 2017 because at the time of \nthe conduct he perceived it was not wrong to patronize prostitutes while on a mission, \nand from 2014 to 2017, he suppressed the information. (Tr. 37, 61) Patronizing prostitutes \nwas legal and accepted in that country. (Tr. 63) He said, \u201cI buried stuff that I did, and this \nall fell in that same category.\u201d (Tr. 37) He further explained, \u201cI buried it, along with all the \nother things that I did to survive.\u201d (Tr. 70) He put the information away, and then he forgot \nabout it. (Tr. 37) In June 2017, AGA revoked Applicant\u2019s SCI access because of his \ninvolvement with prostitutes from 2012 to 2014. (Tr. 32) AGI cited the repeated acts of \nengaging in sex with prostitutes over several years, and noted it was \u201ceven more of a \nconcern that he was engaging in prostitution in a foreign country while assigned there for \nemployment with the U.S. Government.\u201d (GE 5 at 3-4) In September 2017, Applicant\u2019s \nfirst appeal of the revocation of his SCI access was denied. (GE 7) In December 2017, \nthe AGA decision to revoke his SCI access was final. (GE 3) \n \nDuring Applicant\u2019s involvement with prostitutes, he was unaware of the prohibitions \nagainst supporting human trafficking through providing financial support to entities \nengaged in prostitution. (Tr. 41-42) The Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) of 2000 \nis a federal law addressing trafficking in persons. The TVPA prohibits trafficking related- \nconduct, including patronizing, or soliciting of a person for the purposes of a commercial \nsex act, in which the commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in \nwhich the person induced to perform such an act has not attained 18 years of age. See \n22 U.S.C. \u00a7 7101 et seq. Extraterritorial jurisdiction does not apply to Applicant\u2019s conduct \nbecause it occurred outside of the United States, and the other statutory exceptions \nestablishing extraterritorial jurisdiction in the TVPA do not apply in this case. See Caroline \nA Fish, Extraterritorial Human Trafficking Prosecutions: Eliminating Zones of Impunity \nWithin the Limits of International Law and Due Process, St. John\u2019s L. Rev. Vol. 91, No. 2, \n(Jan. 2018). AGA\u2019s policies against human trafficking from 2012 to 2014 are not part of \nthe file. \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \nAt the time he engaged in solicitation or patronization of prostitutes outside the \nUnited States, Applicant did not know whether the women were coerced or fraudulently \ninduced to engage in prostitution at the bordellos. The women could have been from \nRussia or other nations of heightened security concern. (Tr. 77) Applicant was not fluent \nin the language of the country where the mission occurred, and persons in the bordello \nmay have realized he was an American. (Tr. 77) The training that he received on human \ntrafficking was perfunctory \u201ccheck the box, answer the question,\u201d and it was not sufficient \nto cause Applicant to think about the law or prohibitions against trafficking before he \nengaged in sexual intercourse with prostitutes. (Tr. 42)    \n \nAfter his security clearance was revoked, Applicant received psychological \ncounseling for three sessions from an AGA-cleared psychologist. (Tr. 22, 26, 71; AE A at \n6) He needed counseling to cope with the years of AGA-authorized lying to complete AGA \nmissions. (Tr. 26) He decided that he could not engage in future missions involving \ndeception. (Tr. 27) He accepted responsibility for his \u201ccatastrophic moral failure\u201d and \n\u201ccatastrophic mistake\u201d relating to his sexual intercourse with prostitutes. (Tr. 27, 35) \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse has been employed by AGA since 1986, and she is aware his \nsecurity clearance was revoked. (Tr. 28, 68, 76) She did not ask, and he did not tell her \nthe reason his security clearance was revoked. (Tr. 28, 66-67) He did not want anyone \nwho is close to him to know about his patronization of prostitutes because he is \nembarrassed about his behavior. (Tr. 68) He conceded he has a personal and \nprofessional interest in keeping his involvement with prostitutes a secret. (Tr. 69) If \nsomeone attempted to use his involvement with prostitutes to coerce or extort classified \ninformation from him, he would inform security, law enforcement, and his spouse about \nhis involvement with prostitutes. (Tr. 29; AE A at 6) \n \nIn sum, Applicant promised that he would not behave in the manner alleged in the \nSOR in the future. (Tr. 34) He will not be exposed to the pressure of using deception and \ningratiating himself with others in a covert role because he will not return to employment \ninvolving his covert-intelligence activity. (Tr. 34) He requested reinstatement of his \nsecurity clearance out of a sense of duty and patriotism. (Tr. 34) He has the skills and \nability to contribute to national security, and he wanted to use those skills to benefit the \nUnited States. (Tr. 34, 75)  \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nApplicant has more than 30 years of employment in the intelligence sector. (AE A \nat 8) In 1996, he received letters of commendation from President Clinton, the Director of \nAGA, and the Deputy Director of AGA. (Tr. 31; GE 8 at 2; AE E) He received a citation \nfor a complex collection operation in 1995, and he was praised for his courage, attention \nto detail, and technical expertise in a field operation. (AE A at 8; AE E) In 1997, Applicant \nreceived a commendation from the Director of AGA. In 1997 and 1998, he received \nCertificates of Distinction from AGA. (Tr. 30-31; AE E) He also received some classified \nawards. (Tr. 31) \n \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \nAside from his activities with prostitutes from 2012 to 2014, Applicant had a \nflawless record. (Tr. 64, 74) He accepted numerous missions which entailed a risk of \ncapture and death. (Tr. 64; GE 8 at 2) The circumstances of his life from 2012 to 2014 \nwere anomalous and will not recur, and he will not be involved with prostitutes in the \nfuture. (Tr. 74-75) He never improperly disclosed classified information. (Tr. 74) He \ndescribed himself as an honest, trustworthy person, and he noted that he has previously \nreported security-related incidents or mistakes. (Tr. 65, 78-79; SOR response) His loyalty \nand dedication to the United States are impeccable. (Tr. 65, 78-79)  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nSexual Behavior \n \nAG \u00b6 12 contains the security concern for sexual behavior: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the \nindividual. \n \nAG \u00b6 13 includes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n \n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior \nthat the individual is unable to stop;  \n \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress;  and \n \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.a allege, and Applicant admitted that from about 2012 to 2014, \nwhile granted access to classified information, Applicant solicited prostitutes about six \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \ntimes. The conduct was not criminal because he engaged in solicitation in a licensed \nbordello, and prostitution is legal in the country where it occurred. Department Counsel \ndid not cite and I have not found any criminal statutes that Applicant violated. Applicant \nwas able to stop soliciting prostitutes in 2014, and it has not recurred in more than five \nyears. Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior occurred in private. AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a) and 13(b) are not \nestablished. AG \u00b6 13(c) and 13(d) are established because his sexual intercourse with \nprostitutes caused him to be vulnerable to exploitation, and it reflects a lack of discretion \nand judgment. \n    \nIn a recent Appeal Board case, the Appeal Board assessed the security \nimplications of an applicant\u2019s involvement in a form of prostitution overseas as follows: \n \n[He and his friend] each dated a couple of different women on this trip, they \npaid their bar fees, went to dinner and/ or dancing, and engaged in \nconsensual sexual activity. [He] engaged in sex with at least one to two \nwomen while on this trip. When they pay the bar fee, it does not mean they \nare paying for sex, sex is never discussed, and the women are not obligated \nto sleep with the men who pay their bar fee to take them out. Prostitution is \nillegal in Thailand. The women that they engaged in sexual activity with \nwere adults, and it was always consensual sex (no other details recalled). \n \n* \n* \n* \n \nApplicant\u2019s contention that he is not participating in prostitution brings to \nmind a Latin phrase, \u201cres ipsa loquitur,\u201d i.e., the thing speaks for itself. He \npaid money to engage in casual, sexual encounters. Despite his claim to \nthe contrary, the routine practice of paying a fee to remove random women \nfrom bars and then later on that same occasion engage in sexual activity \nwith them is a form of prostitution. In the above indented quote, Applicant \nadmitted that prostitution is illegal in Thailand. Disqualifying Condition 13(a) \nwas established. \n \nAdditionally, Applicant\u2019s conduct is at the very least high-risk sexual \nbehavior that calls into question his judgment. Such behavior establishes \ndisqualifying conditions under Guideline E that address conduct involving \nquestionable judgment. \n \nISCR Case No. 16-03690 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 15, 2018) (footnotes omitted).  \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \nAG \u00b6 14 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; \n \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and \n \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \n \nAG \u00b6 14(a) does not apply because Applicant sought the services of prostitutes \nwhen he was in his 50s. AG \u00b6 14(b) partially applies because his involvement with \nprostitutes was not recent as it ended in 2014. It was somewhat frequent as it occurred \nfive or six times. It occurred under unusual circumstances as he was on close-contact \ncovert overseas missions acting without back-up support. He was required to deceive \nothers to maintain his cover identity. He will not go on such missions in the future. He was \ntaking a large amount of AndroGel, and he is no longer taking so much of this medication. \nHowever, his behavior with the prostitutes continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment for the reasons cited in the next paragraph. \n \nThe SOR alleges from about 2012 to 2014, while granted access to classified \ninformation, Applicant solicited prostitutes about six times. The SOR does not allege that: \n(1) Applicant did more than just solicit prostitutes, he engaged in sexual intercourse with \nprostitutes five or six times in exchange for about $100 on each occasion; (2) the sexual \nintercourse with prostitutes occurred in a foreign country; (3) Applicant was on a covert \nmission in which he knew he was supposed to avoid non-mission-related personal contact \nwith foreign nationals; (4) Applicant did not have back-up security from AGA while he was \nin the bordellos; (5) AGA was unaware of his contacts with prostitutes at the time they \noccurred; (6) if something bad happened to him in the bordellos, AGA would not have \n\n \n10 \n                                         \n \nknown how or where to come to his aid; (7) Applicant had SCI access at the time he was \ninvolved with prostitutes; (8) Applicant did not disclose his involvement with the prostitutes \nuntil 2017 during a pre-polygraph interview; (9) Applicant did not know whether the \nprostitutes were coerced or induced by fraud to be prostitutes; (10) Applicant did not know \nwhether foreign intelligence or criminals were involved with the bordellos; and (11) \nApplicant did not disclose his involvement with prostitutes to his wife and children \nbecause of embarrassment. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), \nthe Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may \nbe considered stating:  \n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.  \n \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-\n0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApril 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). I limited my consideration of these 11 \nissues to the five purposes listed above.  \n \nAG \u00b6 14(c) does not fully apply because Applicant is too embarrassed to disclose \nthe information about his involvement with prostitutes to his spouse and children. \nApplicant receives some mitigation credit under AG \u00b6 14(c) because he disclosed the \ninformation about his involvement with prostitutes to security officials in 2017, and he \npromised to disclose the information to his family if anyone attempted to use the \ninformation to coerce classified information from him. Absent his disclosure, it is unlikely \nthat his involvement with prostitutes would have been discovered. \n \nAG \u00b6 14(d) partially applies. Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior with prostitutes was \nstrictly private and discrete. However, Applicant did not meet his burden of proving the \nprostitutes\u2019 sexual intercourse with him was consensual. Appellant did not establish that \nthe women freely chose to be prostitutes without being coerced or fraudulently induced \nto be prostitutes by the owners of the bordellos.  \n \nAG \u00b6 14(e) partially applies. Applicant received three therapy counseling sessions \nto address his judgment and decision making. He does not receive full credit because he \ndid not provide recommendations for future therapy and a favorable prognosis from a \nqualified mental-health professional indicating the behavior is readily controllable with \ntreatment. \n \nThe 11 non-SOR features of his involvement with prostitutes overseas listed \npreviously outweigh the mitigating information. Applicant was on a highly classified covert \nmission. Applicant repeatedly violated mission restrictions against personal contacts. He \ndid not know the nationalities of the women he paid for sex. He did not establish the \n\n \n11 \n                                         \n \nbordellos were unconnected to criminals or a foreign intelligence service. He did not \ndisclose his involvement with prostitutes until 2017 to AGA even though he knew he was \nsupposed to timely disclose mission anomalies. Taking responsibility for one\u2019s conduct is \noften considered the first step on the road to rehabilitation, and Applicant has taken that \nfirst step; however, more time must pass without actions of security concern before \nreinstatement of his security clearance will be warranted. Guideline D security concerns \nare not mitigated at this time. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 includes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include:  \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: . . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty \nor rule violations; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.a allege and Applicant admitted that from about 2012 to 2014, \nwhile granted access to classified information, he solicited prostitutes about six times. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 16(d) and 16(e) are established.    \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this \ncase: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n\n \n12 \n                                         \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules and \nregulations. \n  \nApplicant\u2019s delay in reporting his involvement with prostitutes to AGA violates \nsecurity and mission rules. As discussed in the previous section, Applicant did not want \ninformation about his involvement with prostitutes to be disclosed to his spouse and \nchildren. None of the mitigating conditions fully apply to Applicant\u2019s conduct as described \nin the sexual behavior section, supra. Personal conduct security concerns are not \nmitigated at this time.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \n\n \n13 \n                                         \n \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines D and \nE are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old senior engineer, who has been employed by his current \nemployer for 19 years. He held a security clearance with access to SCI from 1986 to \n2017. He wants his security clearance to be reinstated to enable him to assist with \nproblem-solving in the intelligence community and to enable him to make important \ncontributions to national security. He has been married for 29 years, and he has three \nchildren. Applicant has a bachelor\u2019s degree and two master\u2019s degrees.  \n \nApplicant presented some important mitigating information. He has more than 30 \nyears of generally outstanding employment in the intelligence sector. He received letters \nof commendation from President Clinton, the Director of AGA, and the Deputy Director of \nAGA as well as citations, certificates of distinction, commendations, and praise for his \ncourage, attention to detail, and technical expertise in a field operation. Aside from his \nactivities with prostitutes from 2012 to 2014, Applicant had a flawless record. He accepted \nnumerous missions which entailed a risk of capture and death. The circumstances of his \nlife from 2012 to 2014 were anomalous and will not recur, and he will not be involved with \nprostitutes in the future. He never improperly disclosed classified information. He \ndescribed himself as an honest, trustworthy person, and he noted that he has previously \nreported incidents or mistakes that reflected poorly on himself and others. His loyalty and \ndedication to the United States are impeccable.  \n \nThe weight of the evidence is against access to classified information for Applicant \nat this time. From about 2012 to 2014, while granted access to classified information and \nSCI, Applicant engaged in sexual intercourse with prostitutes five or six times in exchange \nfor about $100 on each occasion. The sexual intercourse with prostitutes occurred in a \nforeign country. He was on a covert mission in which he knew he was supposed to avoid \nnon-mission-related personal contact with foreign nationals. He did not have back-up \nsecurity while he was in the bordellos. He did not establish the bordellos were \nunconnected to criminals or a foreign intelligence service. He did not establish the women \nhe paid for sex in the bordellos were engaging in prostitute without being coerced or \ninduced by fraud to be prostitutes. AGA was unaware of his contacts with prostitutes at \nthe times they occurred. If something bad happened to him in the bordellos, AGA would \nnot have known how to come to his aid. AGA may have had to compromise AGA\u2019s \nintelligence activity by seeking help from foreign law enforcement to rescue or assist \nApplicant.  \n \nApplicant did not disclose his involvement with the prostitutes until 2017 during a \npre-polygraph interview. His delay in reporting this conduct violated security and \n\n14 \noperational rules. Applicant did not disclose his involvement with prostitutes to his wife \nand children because of embarrassment. Applicant\u2019s conduct with prostitutes from about \n2012 to 2014 was \u201cat the very least high-risk sexual behavior that calls into question his \njudgment. Such behavior establishes disqualifying conditions under Guideline E that \naddress conduct involving questionable judgment.\u201d ISCR Case No. 16-03690 at 3 (App. \nBd. Aug. 15, 2018).    \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the granting a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth \nin Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in \nthe context of the whole person. Unmitigated sexual behavior and personal conduct \nsecurity concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is \nnot warranted at this time.   \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n_________________________ \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Charles McCullough, III, Esquire \n \nMay 21, 2020 \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge: \n \nOn August 18, 2016, Applicant submitted his most recent Electronic \nQuestionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). (Item 3.) On April 2, 2019, the \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign \nInfluence). The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) effective within the Department of Defense on June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on May 7, 2019, and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals. (Item 2.) He subsequently requested through counsel that his case be decided \non the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the file of relevant material \n\n \n \n \n \n \n2 \n(FORM) prepared by Department Counsel, consisting of Items 1 to 6, was provided to \nApplicant on October 9, 2019. Applicant received received the file on October 17, 2019.  \n \n \nAttached to the FORM is a request for administrative notice concerning the \nIslamic Republic of Iran (Iran). Department Counsel provided a seven-page summary of \nthe facts, supported by 18 Government documents pertaining to Iran. The documents \nprovide elaboration and context for the summary. I take administrative notice of the \nfacts included in the U.S. Government reports. They are limited to matters of general \nknowledge, not subject to reasonable dispute. They are set out in the Findings of Fact.  \n \n \nApplicant was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and \nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He submitted additional \ninformation in a timely fashion. Department Counsel had no objection and the \nsubmission is admitted into evidence as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A. The case was assigned \nto me on December 5, 2019. Based upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, \nnational security eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 37 and married. He and his wife have two boys. He seeks to obtain \nnational security eligibility for access to classified information in connection with his \nemployment as a Senior Solutions Architect for a defense contractor. (Item 4 at \nSections 17 and 18.) \n \nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline B (Foreign Influence) \n \n \nApplicant was born in the United States in 1982. His parents, who were born in \nIran, were living in the United States at the time. Applicant lived in the United States \nuntil he was 9 years old, when his family moved back to Iran. Applicant returned to the \nUnited States in 1997 and has lived here continuously since that time. He has never \nbeen a citizen of Iran. He has not traveled to Iran since moving back to the United \nStates. (Item 3 at Section 18; Item 5 at 2.) He attended high school and college in the \nUnited States, and has worked for his present employer since January 2010. (Item 4 at \nSections 12 and 13A.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife is a naturalized American citizen. She was born in Canada. Her \nparents are citizens of Canada, and are of Iranian descent. She is also employed in the \ndefense industry. (Item 2 at 39; Item 4 at Sections 17 and 18.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents moved permanently to the United States in approximately \n2011, and they have become naturalized American citizens. They both now live with \nApplicant, since his mother has serious health issues. (Item 2 at 4.) \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \nThe following are the specific security concerns raised in the SOR: \n \n \n(a) Applicant\u2019s father worked for a local police department in Iran until he retired \nin 1979, over 40 years ago. He is 79 years old. At one point he received a small pension \nfrom the Iranian government. Applicant does not believe his father still receives a \npension. (Item 2 at 29; Item 6 at 5.)  \n \n \n(b) Applicant has one older brother. He is about 20 years older than Applicant, \nand they have little in common due to their age difference. Applicant\u2019s brother is a dual \ncitizen of Iran and the United States, and currently lives in Iran. He is a language \nteacher. Applicant has not seen his brother since he moved back to Iran around 2016. \nApplicant has had little contact of any kind with his brother since he returned to Iran. He \ndoes not know his brother\u2019s address in Iran. (Item 2 at 29; Item 6 at 5.) \n \n \n(c) Applicant has one older sister. She is about 18 years older than Applicant and \nthey have little in common due to their age difference. Applicant\u2019s sister is a dual citizen \nof Iran and the United States, and currently lives in Iran. She is a housewife. Applicant \nhas not seen his sister since she moved back to Iran around 2016. Applicant has had \nlittle contact of any kind with his sister since she returned to Iran. He does not know his \nsister\u2019s address in Iran. (Item 2 at 29; Item 6 at 5.) \n \nMitigation \n \n \nApplicant is highly respected as a person, and as a successful and talented \nengineer. Letters of recommendation were provided by coworkers, who are also \nApplicant\u2019s personal friends. They all admire his professional accomplishments, and \nview him as a trustworthy person worthy of national security eligibility. (Item 2 at 36-38, \n40-42.)  \n \n \nOn coworker, who has known Applicant since 2011, ended his letter: \n \nIn conclusion, if it\u2019s a matter of an individual displaying integrity, ethics, \nhonor and taking pride in themselves both personally and professionally, I \ncan say that [Applicant] has all those qualities . . . as well as an \nabundance of other positive tangible merits that I\u2019ve had the privilege to \nwitness in person and . . . years to come. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s work evaluations are consistently \u201cOutstanding,\u201d the highest ranking. \n(Item 2 at 44-73.) In 2016, in evaluating areas Applicant needed to improve, his \nsupervisor said, \u201cHe [Applicant] has been doing an outstanding job since he started in \n2010. He believes he needs improvement in all areas. I believe he needs to spend more \ntime with his family and his children.\u201d (Item 2 at 45.) \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \nOver the years Applicant has also received many letters of appreciation from his \nmanagement. Many of these letters include laudatory comments from customers served \nby Applicant. (Item 2 at 75-89.) \n \nIran \n \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts about Iran:  \n \n \nIran is an authoritarian theocratic republic. The U.S. Department of State advises \nAmerican citizens not to visit Iran due to the very high risk of kidnapping, arrest and \ndetention of U.S. citizens in Iran, particularly dual national Iranian-Americans. Iran has \nbeen designated a state sponsor of terrorism since 1984. Iran continues to present a \ncyber-espionage and attack threat. The Iranian government\u2019s human-rights record is \nextremely poor. There are numerous reports of unlawful killings, forced disappearance \nand torture. (Request for Administrative Notice: Attachments.) \n \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant=s suitability for national security eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are \nuseful in evaluating an applicant=s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge=s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG & 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the Awhole-person concept.@ The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG & 2(b) \nrequires that, AAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.@ In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nAccording to Directive & E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive & E3.1.15, \u201cThe \napplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \n\n \n \n \n \n \n5 \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information.  \n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201cAny determination under this \norder adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified \nor sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nParagraph 1 - Guideline B (Foreign Influence) \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \n\n \n \n \n \n \n6 \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and  \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion. \n \n  \nApplicant has one brother and one sister currently living in Iran. His father, who is \nnow an American citizen and lives in the United States with Applicant, worked for a local \npolice department in Iran over 40 years ago. The evidence is sufficient to raise these \ndisqualifying conditions.  \n \nIran has a government that operates contrary to U.S. interests. Iran\u2019s \ngovernment is a state sponsor of terrorism, and engages in significant human rights \nabuses. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s family connections in that country have the potential to \ngenerate a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, \nor coercion under AG \u00b6 7(a). The DOHA Appeal Board has said that the mere \npossession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of \nlaw, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign \ncountry and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to \ncreate the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise \nof classified information. (See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); \nISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).) \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n7 \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nApplicant has minimal contact with his family members who live in Iran. He last \nhad personal contact with either of them in 2016, before they moved back to Iran. \nApplicant, his wife, and sons are all American citizens and reside here. Applicant\u2019s \nconnections with his direct family here far outweigh his contacts with his siblings in Iran. \nHe is a native-born American citizen, who has made a good and successful life here. He \nis liked and respected by co-workers. His managers at work are fully supportive of him. \nHe is extremely knowledgeable of his obligations as a person holding national security \neligibility. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), (b), and (c) apply. \n \nI have carefully considered the fact that Applicant\u2019s two siblings live in Iran. In \nthis particular case, I find that Applicant has mitigated the security significance arising \nfrom their presence for the following reasons. Applicant has consistently identified his \nsiblings and discussed his tenuous relationship with them. Applicant has completely \nmitigated the security significance of the presence of his relations in Iran. Paragraph 1 is \nfound for Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant=s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n\n \n \n \n \n \n8 \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility and a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant was born and raised primarily in the United States. He has lived here \ncontinuously since he was 16. Applicant has shown himself to be a talented and \npatriotic American citizen and member of the defense industry. He can be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States due to his sense of loyalty to \nthe United States. His attenuated relations with two much-older siblings who reside in \nIran do not create significant potential for pressure, coercion, or duress. \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. For all \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the Foreign Influence security concerns. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c:   \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n9 \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017. In a \nresponse notarized on June 1, 2019, Applicant admitted 12 of the 20 allegations raised \nand requested a hearing before a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nadministrative judge. I was assigned the case on August 2, 2019.  \n \nOn September 25, 2019, a notice setting the hearing for October 23, 2019, was \nissued. The hearing was convened as scheduled. Without objection, the Government \nintroduced 10 exhibits (Exs.), noted as Exs. 1-10, and Applicant presented 11 \ndocuments, accepted without objection as Exs. A-K. Applicant also introduced one \nwitness. The Government moved to amend the SOR to include a new allegation as 1.u. \nThe addition indicated that Applicant owed approximately $7,000 in delinquent taxes to \na third state. (Ex. K; Transcript at 88-91) The motion was granted without objection. \n\n \n \n \n \n2 \nApplicant was granted through October 30, 2019, to submit any additional \nmaterials. The transcript of the proceeding (Tr.) was received on October 31, 2019. \nAdditional documents were received and forwarded to me on November 1, 2019, and \naccepted without objection as Exs. K-Q, with a final file of material received and \naccepted without objection as Ex. R on November 15, 2019. The record was then \nclosed. Based on the testimony, materials, and record as a whole, I find Applicant failed \nto mitigate financial considerations security concerns. \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old protective security officer who has served in that \nprofession for different entities since 2004. She has completed nearly 100 college \ncredits. Twice divorced and remarried, she has four children in their 20s. At issue are    \n18 federal and state-related tax issues (SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.q, 1.u), including \nfailure to timely file multiple federal and state tax returns, and three delinquent \ncommercial accounts (SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.r-1.t). In sum, nearly $70,000 of delinquent \ntaxes and delinquent debts are at issue, with almost $58,000 related to taxes and the \nbalances related to a medical account ($2,117), a charged off credit card ($2,347), and \nabout $4,774 past due on a student loan with a total balance of $86,210.  \n \nIn 2004, Applicant divorced her second husband. The resultant lack of housing \nand financial distress led her to a three-month period of homelessness (December 2007 \nto March 2008) while taking care of her children. (Tr. 21, 53) Related financial problems \nlasted until at least 2009, when some of her children went to live elsewhere and she \nwas obligated to pay child support. Meanwhile, she failed to timely file federal and state \ntax returns. Applicant\u2019s main focus had been \u201ctrying to survive,\u201d caring for her children, \nmaintaining long hours associated with her work, and, occasionally, taking second jobs. \n(Tr. 40)  \n \nApplicant did not know she could seek an extension to file her taxes. (Tr. 21, 49) \nAs a result, \u201cpersonal responsibility to take care of [her] administrative paperwork . . . \nfell by the wayside.\u201d (Tr. 51) She noted that \u201cduring [her] challenges, unfortunately, \npaying the taxes became secondary to initial survival and recovery.\u201d (Tr. 52) By 2013, \nshe was confused as to her financial situation in terms of taxes. (Tr. 63, 67) As before, \n\u201cother things were happening in [her] life and [she] didn\u2019t stay on top of it.\u201d (Tr. 67) \nMeanwhile, errors with her taxes and tax forms were encountered, such as lost or \nmissing W-2 tax statements and delays from employers to get copies of needed \npaperwork. (Tr. 67-68, 72)  \n \nIn sum, federal tax returns were not timely filed for tax years (TY) 2004-2006, \n2008-2015, and 2017 (with delinquent taxes owed for TYs 2008-2011 and 2013-14 \namounting to about $24,200); state tax returns were not timely filed for TYs 2004, 2008-\n2009, and 2012-2013 (with delinquent taxes owed for TYs 2004, 2007-2009, 2012-2013 \namounting to almost $5,000); delinquent state taxes owed to a second state for about \n$1,300); and a state tax return was not timely filed to a third state for TY 2017 (to which \n\n \n \n \n \n3 \nshe owed about $7,000). Applicant testified that her tax returns for TY 2017 and 2018 \nwere filed in April 2019. (Tr. 56) \n \nAs for her federal tax liability of around $52,000, Applicant initially made some \npayments to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). (Tr. 60) Those proceeds, however, \nwere diverted to her ex-husband by the IRS to address her child support arrearage. (Tr. \n60-62) In 2013, a tax advisor briefly started reviewing Applicant\u2019s federal tax situation \nbefore the job went to someone else. (Tr. 64-65) Tax transcripts suggest zero dollars \nare currently owed for TY 2004, 2005, 2006, 2012, and 2015 due to methods such as \napplication of refunds, but Applicant\u2019s information indicate confusion remains. (Ex. 4) \nAfter the SOR was issued in September 2019, Applicant\u2019s present husband suggested \nshe revisit a tax attorney and let him attempt to negotiate and compromise with the IRS \non the amount owed. (Tr. 56, 65-66, 71; Ex. L) The attorney initiated that action in \nSeptember 2019, shortly before the hearing. (Tr. 57, 74; Ex. Q) At present, the attorney \nis trying to get her federal tax situation contained and resolved. (Tr. 85)  \n \nThat attorney is also working with Applicant\u2019s state tax issues, a job he initially \nstarted in 2013 before personal \u201clife issues\u201d arose that diverted him from her case. (Tr. \n69-71) Applicant\u2019s tax liability to her primary state, the approximately $5,000 at issue, \nwas initially reviewed by the tax advisor. Actual progress on that state\u2019s taxes, however, \nwas successfully initiated and made by that state in and after 2013. The state\u2019s efforts \nbrought Applicant\u2019s tax balance owed to that state to zero through garnishment and tax \nrefunds. (Ex. E; Tr. 87-89).  \n \nThe attorney is also working on her state tax issues with a second state. The \nsecond state\u2019s tax liability was inadvertently satisfied when payments to a third state \nwere misapplied by Applicant\u2019s employer (SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.o-1.p for about $1,335). \n(Tr. 103) They were for delinquent taxes dating back to 2014 and 2015. (Tr. 74) This \nfollowed Applicant\u2019s initiation of an installment repayment plan in June 2019, reflected at \nEx. H. (Tr. 75) She testified that she also had been making regular payments toward \nthose balances through her online bank account, but she provided no documentation \nreflecting such payments. (Tr. 75) She also testified that the state at issue has no \nrecords of her employer paying certain taxes to it on her behalf. (Tr. 76) The attorney is \nalso handling the tax issue involving a third state. For that state, Applicant testified that \na belated tax return was filed, but she is awaiting a refund from another state to satisfy \nthe balance owed. (Tr. 91)         \n \nWith regard to a student loan account noted at SOR allegation \u00b6 1.r, Applicant \nshowed that she consolidated her student loans in May 2019. (Tr. Ex. B-C; Tr. 77) She \nwas approved in October 2019, the day before the hearing, to be in forbearance on the \naccount through May 2020 in order to work on her tax issues. (Ex. B; Tr. 76-77) \nApplicant testified she has been making payments on a charged off credit card, noted at \nSOR allegation \u00b6 1.s for $2,437, but provided no documentation of such payments after \nthe hearing. (Tr. 78) A medical debt, noted at SOR allegation \u00b6 1.t from 2016 for $2,117 \nhas been satisfied. (Ex. A; Tr. 81) \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4 \nApplicant and her husband own their home on which they pay a mortgage. \nApplicant\u2019s personal financial statement shows a net monthly remainder of $7,638, with \nassets including the mortgaged home and about $226,000 in investments and \nautomobiles. (Ex. 11) Applicant\u2019s husband fully supports his wife in addressing her \ndebts and is willing to add his financial resources toward her effort to satisfy her debts \nwhen matters are sorted and balances are clarified. (Tr. 92-98) Applicant acknowledged \nthat her tax debt has been \u201cpretty much of a mess for pretty much a decade between \nsurvival, neglect, ignorance, [and] all of that . . . [She] was so busy taking care of others \nthat [she] neglected [herself] and [her] responsibility. . . .\u201d (Tr. 99) At present, her \nfinances are stable and her life is peaceful. She and her husband are both committed to \nresolving the accounts at issue. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions \nnecessarily include consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the \nnational interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant.  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5 \nAnalysis \n \nUnder Guideline F, AG \u00b6 18 sets forth that the security concern under this \nguideline is that failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.  \n \nHere, the Government offered documentary evidence reflecting that Applicant \nfailed to timely file both federal and state tax returns, and to pay taxes owed for multiple \ntax years. In addition, three delinquent debts were cited. This is sufficient to invoke \nfinancial considerations disqualifying conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the inability to do so;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations, and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \n \nFour conditions could mitigate the finance related security concerns posed here:  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \n           Applicant\u2019s multiple federal and state tax issues arose from about 2004 through \n2017. They largely remain existent today. She has had a tax advisor and a tax attorney \n\n \n \n \n \n6 \nwork on these issues off and on since 2013, with the tax attorney once again working on \nthem today. She admits the need for help in order to sort her various tax issues. \nPersonal life struggles, such as divorce, plagued her for years. It appears that marriage \nto her current husband around 2013 helped stabilize her finances and her life going \nforward, but there is scant documentation reflecting she acted reasonably regarding her \ntax issues between 2004 and 2013. Instead, it appears she was simply overwhelmed by \nher situation then and now. \n \nThere is no documentation showing Applicant has received any counseling that \nhas resulted in her tax issues being resolved or made manageable, although there is \nevidence her student loans were put into deferment and a medical debt satisfied. Going \nforward, Applicant is depending on her tax attorney to sort out, negotiate, or coordinate \nher various tax issues. This method has continued for some time without notable \nprogress. Much of the action that was noted was initiated after the SOR was issued. To \nher credit, however, it appears progress could begin to yield some forms of resolution in \nthe near future.  \n \nApplicant is now awaiting information about an offer to compromise with the IRS \nconcerning her federal tax issues, an effort her attorney initiated the month the SOR \nwas issued. There is documentary evidence showing the tax returns at issue have \nlargely been filed; little documentation confirms a majority of the taxes owed have been \npaid. For now, the haphazard approach taken to resolve these issues has only yielded \npiecemeal results that have yet to demonstrate a comprehensive and reasonable \nstrategy for addressing the concerns raised. At best, I find AG \u00b6 20(b) applies in part.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an one\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and all \nrelevant circumstances. Here, I have considered the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d). Moreover, I am mindful that the ultimate determination of whether to \ngrant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment \nbased on careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old protective security officer. Since 2004, she has served \nin that profession for multiple employers. She completed some college. Married, she \nhas four adult children. Her husband is successful and willing to help Applicant once her \ntax situation is better sorted and defined.   \n \nIn 2004, Applicant divorced her previous husband. Thus began about a decade \nduring which tax returns were not timely filed and debts were neglected. It is unclear if \nall the tax returns at issue have been filed. Her federal tax liability is still unpaid with no \nevidence it might be resolved through compromise in the near future. State taxes to her \nprimary state were apparently resolved not by action by Applicant, but through that \nstate\u2019s action in the form of garnishment and tax refund withholding. Taxes to a second \nstate were inadvertently satisfied by her employer, who expected those proceeds to go \n\n \n \n \n \n7 \nto yet a third state. In the end, however, the liabilities owed to the first and second \nstates are now at zero through the actions of others. To date, Applicant\u2019s third state tax \nliability remains unaddressed. Her student loan is now in deferral and a minor medical \nbalance has been paid, but no documentary evidence was submitted detailing progress \non a charged off credit card.  \n \nThe Appeal Board has repeatedly noted that failing to voluntarily comply with \none\u2019s tax obligations is of special security significance. Moreover, efforts to address \none\u2019s tax issues after the issuance of an SOR is of particular note. Failure to timely file \ntax returns suggests a problem with complying with government rules and fails to reflect \nthe high degree of judgment and reliability required for gaining access to classified \ninformation. While Applicant is genuinely contrite over having let her tax and financial \nsituation get to this point, she is now giving them more serious attention. Her \ndocumented record of success to date, however, remains slight and scattered. More \ntime is needed for her to demonstrate a coordinated and sustained effort to \ncomprehensively address her issues, and to gather the documentation needed to show \nshe has her situation under control. I find Applicant failed to mitigate financial \nconsiderations security concerns.  \n \n   Formal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h-1.p: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.r:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.s:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.t-1.u: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

Applicant\u2019s request for eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 20, 2017, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain eligibility for access to classified information \nas part of his employment with a defense contractor. After reviewing the completed \nbackground investigation, adjudicators at the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) could not determine that it was clearly consistent with \nthe interests of national security for Applicant to have access to classified information, as \nrequired by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DOD Directive 5220.6 \n(Directive). \n\n \n2 \n \n \nOn August 16, 2019, the DOD CAF issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nfacts that raise security concerns addressed under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption). The adjudicative guidelines (AG) cited in the \nSOR were issued by the Director of National Intelligence on December 10, 2016, to be \neffective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. Applicant timely responded to the \nSOR (Answer) and requested a decision without a hearing. \n \nOn October 11, 2019, as provided for by paragraph E3.1.7 of the Directive, \nDepartment Counsel for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) prepared \na File of Relevant Material (FORM) that was forwarded to Applicant on October 24, 2019. \nThe FORM contained six documents (Items 1 \u2013 6) on which the Government relies to \nestablish the facts alleged in the SOR. Applicant received the FORM on November 1, \n2019 and was informed therein that he had 30 days from the date of receipt to object to \nthe use of any or all of the information included in the FORM and to submit additional \ninformation in response to the FORM.  \n \nThe record closed on December 4, 2019, after Applicant did not respond to the \nFORM or object to the consideration of any of the Government\u2019s exhibits. I received this \ncase for decision on December 16, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nCiting Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant did not timely file his federal \n(SOR 1.a) or state (SOR 1.b) income tax returns for the 2016 tax year; and that he did \nnot timely file his federal (SOR 1.c) or state (SOR 1.c) income tax returns for the 2017 tax \nyear. Additionally, the SOR alleged that Applicant owes the IRS $3,516.54 in unpaid taxes \nfrom the 2015 tax year (SOR 1.e) (FORM, Item 1) \n \n \nCiting Guideline G, the SOR alleged that in February 2016, Applicant was arrested \nand charged with driving under the influence (DWI) (SOR 2.c); that in July 2016, Applicant \ndid not comply with court-ordered completion of an alcohol safety and awareness \nprogram (ASAP) (SOR 2.b); and that in July 2016, he was charged with ASAP non-\ncompliance (SOR 2.a). (FORM, Item 1) \n \n \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted with explanation each of the Guideline \nF allegations. His explanations included assertions that all of his income tax returns have \nbeen filed, albeit late due to work-related travel, and that he is in a repayment plan for the \ntax debt alleged at SOR 1.e. With his Answer, he provided a letter from a tax preparation \nservice regarding taxes owed for 2015. Under Guideline G, Applicant admitted SOR 2.a \nand 2.c, but denied SOR 2.b. In support of his Answer, he provided records related to \ncourt-ordered counseling and other aspects of his DWI arrest. (FORM, Item 1). In addition \nto the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor, for whom he has \nworked as an installer since September 2017. He has worked for other companies in \nsimilar positions since about October 2013, and he was laid off at the end of contracts at \nleast twice. This is his first application for a security clearance. When Applicant submitted \n\n \n3 \n \nhis e-QIP, he disclosed his 2016 DWI arrest, and he disclosed his failure to file and/or \npay his federal and state income tax returns as alleged in the SOR. (FORM, Item 3) \n \n \nDuring the ensuing background investigation, Applicant completed a subject \ninterview (SI) with a government investigator on August 24, 2018. His DWI arrest was \none of the topics discussed during the SI. Applicant stated (and other information shows) \nthat on February 26, 2016, he was pulled over on his way home from a nightclub where \nhe was working during one of his periods of unemployment. He consumed at least three \nmixed drinks a few hours before heading home. He was pulled over for reasons not stated \nin this record and, although he passed a field sobriety test, he failed a breathalyzer and \nwas charged with DWI. Court and counseling records show he had a blood alcohol \ncontent (BAC) of between .15 and .20. Applicant was held overnight in jail and appeared \nin court to answer the charges on July 25, 2016. (FORM, Items 1, 2, 4, and 5) \n \n \nAlthough Applicant has admitted the SOR 2.a allegation that he was charged with \nnon-compliance with an order to complete ASAP, it is not clear in this record that there \nwas any such order in place before his July 2016 hearing on the DWI arrest. The record \non which this allegation was based (FORM, Item 6) places the offense on the same date \nas Applicant\u2019s court appearance in response to the DWI charge. At his hearing, Applicant \npleaded guilty to a charge of DWI 1st Offense BAC .15 - .20. He was placed on one year \nof supervised probation and ordered to serve five weekends in jail, three of which were \nsuspended. Additionally, Applicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license was suspended for one year. On \nNovember 8, 2016, he was given permission to drive on a restricted basis until July 2017, \nand an interlock breathalyzer was installed on his car until March 2017. The court also \nordered Applicant to enroll in a 10-session ASAP by October 21, 2016, well after the date \non which he was supposedly charged with ASAP non-compliance. Available information \nshows he enrolled as ordered and completed ASAP on December 1, 2016, with above-\naverage marks for participation, attitude, and interest in the class. On March 14, 2017, \nApplicant also completed a court-ordered clinical evaluation by a licensed clinical social \nworker. That evaluation concluded Applicant had a moderate alcohol disorder, but he was \nnot referred for any additional counseling as his was an isolated incident and he was \nreceptive to counseling advice. Finally, Applicant attended five court-ordered Alcoholics \nAnonymous (AA) meetings and paid all fines and court costs in a timely manner. (FORM, \nItems 1 \u2013 6) \n \n \nApplicant has averred in response to the SOR that all of his income tax returns \nhave been filed, albeit late after filing extensions. Although he disclosed much of this \ninformation in his e-QIP, a summary of the SI does not reflect any discussion of \nApplicant\u2019s income tax returns as part of other financial matters discussed. In response \nto interrogatories about his taxes from Department Counsel in January 2019, Applicant \nprovided statements and documents that show the following: \n \n- \nApplicant\u2019s state and federal income tax returns have not been filed for the \n2016 tax year only. \n \n \n- \nApplicant owes $3,516.54 for unpaid federal taxes in the 2015 tax year. That \ndebt initially was determined to be non-collectable, but subsequently was \n\n \n4 \n \nreferred to a collection agency in May 2018. Applicant entered into a repayment \nagreement with the IRS in May 2018, but the agreement ended in September \n2018. The debt remains unpaid. \n \n- \nApplicant\u2019s 2014, 2015, and 2017 income tax returns were filed a few months \nlate. IRS records do not show that he requested a filing deadline extension in \nany of those years. Ironically, he filed for an extension of his 2016 return, but \nhe has not yet filed that return. SOR 1.c is resolved for Applicant. \n \n- \nAlthough he filed his other federal returns, there is no indication he has filed his \nstate returns for 2016 or 2017. (FORM, Item 3) \n \n \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant provided a letter from the firm that prepared and \nfiled his 2015 federal return. At that time, the SOR 1.e debt was $2,637 and continues to \naccrue penalties and interest. (FORM, Item 1) Applicant did not provide any additional \ninformation about his finances. He also did not establish that he has consulted with any \ntax or other financial professionals for help in resolving his income tax filing discrepancies \nor other aspects of his finances. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are:  \n \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988)) \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \n\n \n5 \n \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nAvailable information shows that Applicant owes $3,516.54 in unpaid federal taxes \nfrom 2015. That debt remains unresolved. He also has not filed his federal or state income \ntax returns for 2016. As to his state returns, although he filed his federal return for 2017, \nhe did not establish that he filed his state returns for that year. Available information also \nshows that Applicant has filed his federal returns late at least three times since 2014. This \ninformation reasonably raises the security concerns articulated, in relevant part, at AG \u00b6 \n18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n \nMore specifically, the Government\u2019s information requires application of the \nfollowing AG \u00b6 19 disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \n \n \nI have also considered the following AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions: \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nNone of these mitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s only stated reason for not \nfiling his income tax returns as required was that he was away on work-related travel. The \nrecord does not support his claims that he filed extensions or that he is in a repayment \nplan with the IRS. He has done nothing since September 2018 to address his tax debt, \nand he now is more than two years past due in filing his 2016 tax returns. As to his 2016 \nand 2017 state returns, Applicant did not meet his burden in response to the SOR and \nthe FORM to show they have been filed or that he is taking some other tangible action to \nresolve those discrepancies. Applicant has not submitted information sufficient to mitigate \nthe security concerns raised under this guideline by the Government\u2019s information. \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe Government\u2019s information showed that Applicant was arrested for DWI in \nFebruary 2016. The allegations that he did not complete ASAP or comply with court-\nordered counseling are directly contradicted by Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and I \nfind for Applicant as to SOR 2.a and 2.b. Nonetheless, the information about Applicant\u2019s \nDWI arrest and conviction reasonably raise security concerns about alcohol consumption \nthat are stated at AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAvailable information further requires application of the disqualifying condition at \nAG \u00b6 22(a): \n \nalcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the \ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s DWI arrest requires application of AG \u00b6 22(a). As part of his sentence \nafter he pleaded guilty, Applicant attended ASAP and was evaluated by a licensed clinical \nsocial worker. The evaluator noted the isolated nature of Applicant\u2019s DWI and his positive \nresponse to court-ordered counseling. Applicant successfully completed all of his court-\nordered counseling and sentencing requirements over two years ago, and has not been \ninvolved in any other alcohol-related incidents in more than three years. The foregoing \nsupports application of the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 23(a): \n \nso much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment. \n \n \nOn balance, available information indicates Applicant\u2019s DWI arrest in early 2016 \nwas an isolated event. Despite the SOR 2.a and 2.b allegations, it appears Applicant \ncomplied with the court\u2019s directions pursuant to his guilty plea. The security concerns \nraised by the Government\u2019s information about Applicant\u2019s use of alcohol are mitigated. \n \nIn addition to my evaluation of the facts and application of the appropriate \nadjudicative factors under Guidelines F and G, I have reviewed the record before me in \nthe context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Mitigation of the security \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s use of alcohol notwithstanding, my review of all of the \navailable information leaves unanswered the doubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability for \naccess to classified information. Applicant has not timely complied with his tax reporting \nobligations since at least 2014. A debt he incurred in the 2015 tax year remains \nunresolved and he still has not filed his 2016 returns. Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR \nfalls far short of resolving these concerns. Because protection of the national interest is \nthe principal focus of these adjudications, any remaining doubts must be resolved against \nthe individual. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e:   \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n8 \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n  \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.c:  \n  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all available information, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request \nfor security clearance eligibility is denied. \n \n \n \n                                             \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He then failed to file annual federal income tax returns on time, as required, for \ntax years 2014-2016. While the tax returns at issue have now been filed and the past-\ndue taxes have now been paid, this is insufficient to mitigate the financial security \nconcerns resulting from his conduct. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on June 14, 2016. On \nJune 13, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order \n(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security \n\n \n2 \n \n \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective \nJune 8, 2017.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 28, 2019, and requested a hearing. The \ncase was assigned to me on August 7, 2019. On August 9, 2019, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice scheduling the hearing for September \n13, 2019.  \n \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were admitted without objection during \nits case in chief, as well as GE 4 through 6, which were offered during rebuttal and \nadmitted without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A, \nwhich was admitted without objection. I held the record open until September 27, 2019, \nto allow him the opportunity to submit additional documentation. He timely submitted \ntwo additional documents, which I marked as AE B and C, and admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the hearing transcript on September 23, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact  \n \n \nApplicant admitted all three SOR allegations, \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c. His admissions \nare incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is 38 years old. He was married from 2008 to 2013. He has no children. \nHe currently lives with his girlfriend and her teenage son. Applicant has some junior \ncollege credits and professional training. He has held jobs as an aircraft mechanic since \n2004 for multiple defense contractors. Since October 2008, he has worked on rotational \ndeployments in Afghanistan, for 60 or 90 days at a time, with 45 to 60 days off in \nbetween. Applicant had worked for his current employer for about a year and a half at \nthe time of the hearing. He has had a clearance since about 2007. (Tr. 10-11; 33-35; \nGE 1) \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns, as required, for tax \nyears 2014, 2015, and 2016. At one point he had past-due federal income tax debt for \nthose years of over $100,000. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c)  \n \nApplicant said it was common practice among his deployed co-workers to \nchange their federal tax withholding status to \u201cexempt\u201d late in the year. The purpose \nwas to increase their paychecks temporarily, so as to have more money for Christmas. \n(Tr. 44, 52, 81-82) During one of his deployments in 2014, Applicant changed his tax \nwithholding status to exempt. Though he initially intended it to be temporary, he failed to \nchange his exemption status back until 2017. (Tr. 56, 61)  \n \n \nApplicant said that he initially changed his withholding status by submitting a \nrevised W-4 form to a company administrator. When he went back later to change it, he \nsaid he had to do it on a company computer. He said he was unable to effect the \n\n \n3 \n \n \nchange because the computer connection from Afghanistan was poor, so after a while \nhe gave up trying. (Tr. 65-66, 80) He acknowledged, however, that he could have made \nthe re-adjustment to his W-4 while he was home on rotational leave, but did not do so. \n(Tr. 84)  \n \nApplicant asserted that, once he exempted all his income, whether he would \nactually qualify for an overseas exemption (of $90,000, he said) would depend on who \nhis tax preparer was, and what they told him about whether or not he qualified. \nHowever, he also acknowledged being told that he did not qualify for an overseas \nexemption, which explained his high tax bills. (Tr. 44-46) \n \nGE 4 is a blank copy of an IRS form W-4 from 2014, like the one Applicant \nprepared. Box 7 contains the following language (emphasis in original), followed by the \nsignature block:  \n \nI claim exemption from withholding for 2014, and I certify that I meet both \nof the following conditions for exemption:  \n \n \n\uf0b7 Last year I had a refund of all federal income tax withheld because I \nhad no tax liability, and  \n\uf0b7 This year I expect a refund of all federal income tax withheld because I \nhad no tax liability. If you meet both conditions, write \u201cExempt\u201d here. \n \nUnder penalties of perjury, I declare that I have examined this certificate \nand, to the best of my knowledge and belief, it is true, correct, and \ncomplete. \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged that, for tax year 2013 and 2014, he owed and paid \ntaxes, so he did not have a right to a refund due to having no tax liability. He \nacknowledged that in signing the W-4 in 2014, he had asserted that his answers were \ntrue, when, in fact, he knew they were false. (Tr. 53-56, 60-61; GE 4, GE 5)  \n \nBy treating all of his income as tax exempt, Applicant had no income taxes \nwithheld for part of 2014, all of 2015, and all of 2016. He then did not timely file his 2014 \ntax return. He acknowledged that had he done so, it would have become clear to him \nthat he was not exempt since he earned far too much income. (Tr. 62-63; GE 5 (an \nexcerpt from an IRS publication noting that any single filer earning more than $10,300 \ncould not be exempt from taxes)).  \n \n \nApplicant earned $158,000 in 2014, $195,000 in tax year 2015, and $140,000 in \n2016. He had no taxes withheld for either year. The exemption remained in place until \nhe changed it in 2017. (Tr. 59, 62) \n   \nBeginning in April 2015, Applicant failed to timely file his federal tax returns for \nthree straight years. He testified at hearing that when he was deployed during tax time, \nit was difficult to address his taxes in a timely manner. He knew that the federal tax filing \n\n \n4 \n \n \ndeadline is April 15 each year, and he said he filed an extension in 2015. But he did not \nfile his 2015 tax return because he was busy and forgot. (Tr. 37-38; GE 1) He also \nreceived correspondence from the IRS each year about his unfiled tax returns and past-\ndue taxes, yet took no action. (GE 2 at 5; Tr. 64, 66-68) \n \nAt the time of the April 15, 2016 tax deadline, Applicant \u201cfreaked out\u201d with anxiety \nabout dealing with it, so he put it off. (Tr. 40, 66) He disclosed his tax issues on his \nSCA, which he filled out in June 2016. He disclosed that he had failed to file his 2014 \nand 2015 federal income tax returns, and estimated owing about $10,000 in past-due \ntaxes for each year. He said he was working on resolving the problem. (GE 1 at 33-34; \nTr. 36-37) He acknowledged that his SCA was what spurred him to act. (Tr. 40-42; GE 1 \nat 33-34) \n \nHowever, Applicant also failed to timely file his 2016 tax return by the April 2017 \ndeadline. In 2017, he hired a tax preparer to address his unfiled taxes. Applicant \nclaimed that his tax preparer told him that his 2016 tax return, filed in December 2017, \nwas not late, because the IRS had granted a filing extension to State 1 residents (such \nas Applicant) since State 1 was impacted by Hurricane Irma. (GE 2 at 5; Tr. 41-42, 88) \nHowever, while the IRS did grant such an extension \u2013 until January 31, 2018 -- it did not \ndo so until September 15, 2017. (GE 6) By that time, Applicant\u2019s 2016 federal income \ntax return, due on April 15, 2017, was already late, unless he had filed a request for an \nextension (which he didn\u2019t). (GE 3; Tr. 89-96)  \n \n \nWith the assistance of his tax preparer, Applicant filed his 2014, 2015, and 2016 \nfederal income tax returns in late December 2017. (GE 3, Tr. 43, 69) He was then \nnotified by the IRS that he owed about $130,000 in past-due taxes for the tax years at \nissue. While he initially considered a monthly repayment plan, he took money out of his \n401(k) fund and paid the taxes back in bulk. (Tr. 71-72; GE 6 at 6) The status of \nApplicant\u2019s late-filed returns and past-due taxes, as alleged in the SOR, is as follows:  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a (2014: Amount alleged: $26,636): The IRS assessed penalties and \ninterest relating to the late filing. In mid-February 2019, Applicant made a lump-sum \npayment of $26,149. After additional adjustments to penalties and interest, he was \nissued a refund of about $1,945 in mid-March 2019. (GE 3 at 1-2) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b (2015: Amount alleged: $65,190): The IRS assessed penalties and \ninterest relating to the late filing. He received a large credit from his 2017 tax payment. \nIn mid-February 2019, Applicant made a lump-sum payment of about $56,660. In March \n2019, he was assessed about $6,000 in additional penalties and interest. (GE 3 at 3-4) \nHis IRS account transcript for tax year 2017 reflects a $13,551 credit transferred out to \nhis 2015 taxes in April 2018. (GE 3 at 7) As of March 2019, he had a zero balance for \nthe 2015 tax year. (GE 3 at 3) (Tr. 48) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c (2016: Amount alleged: $40,128): The IRS assessed penalties and \ninterest relating to the late filing. In mid-February 2019, Applicant made a lump-sum \npayment of about $44,520. In March 2019, he was assessed about $5,100 in additional \n\n \n5 \n \n \npenalties and interest. As of April 2019, he had a zero balance for the 2015 tax year. \n(GE 3 at 5-6) \n \n \nApplicant filed his 2017 federal income tax returns on or about April 15, 2018 (on \ntime). As of May 2018, he had a zero balance for the 2017 tax year. (GE 3 at 7) \n \nApplicant acknowledged that he did not save the money he was not paying in \ntaxes. He figured his tactic would catch up to him eventually, and he would address his \ntax debt through a payment plan. (Tr. 78-79) He testified that by resolving his federal tax \ndebts by taking early withdrawals from his 401(k) funds, this in turn, caused additional \ntax consequences, for the 2019 tax year. He said he has an extra $500 withheld from \nhis pay to account for that. (Tr. 47-48-51, 72, 86, 107; AE B, AE C) It is unclear, \nhowever, what the tax consequences might be for the early withdrawals from his 401(k).  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged his actions, said it was a mistake, and said he \u201cdidn\u2019t \nhandle it well.\u201d He also noted that his tax returns had been filed and his debts paid. (Tr. \n49) \n \n \nApplicant currently earns between $140,000 and $150,000 a year. (Tr. 72-73) He \nowns several used cars. He purchased his most recent car in 2016, for about $28,000 \nor $30,000. He has a monthly payment. He also bought a $25,000 boat, in 2015, for \nwhich he also has a monthly payment. (Tr. 73-75)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor since 2010 provided a reference letter attesting to his \noutstanding performance, dependability, and professional demeanor. Other professional \nand personal references provided letters attesting to Applicant\u2019s character, \nprofessionalism, dependability, and trustworthiness. (AE A) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \n\n \n6 \n \n \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe guideline sets forth several conditions that could raise security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \n \n \nWhen he was deployed overseas in 2014, Applicant falsely claimed that his \nincome was tax exempt, leading to several thousand dollars of past-due federal income \ntaxes. Rather than stockpile the money he should have paid in taxes, he spent it. He \nalso failed to file annual federal income tax returns on time, as required, for tax years \n2014-2016. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19 (a), (b), (c) and (f) all apply. \n \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis added), the \nDOHA appeal board detailed the security concern about applicants who fail to file their \ntax returns as follows:  \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. \nVoluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for \nprotecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 20, 2002). As we have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is \nnot directed at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No, 07-08049 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same token, neither is it directed towards \ninducing an applicant to file tax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails \nrepeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the \nhigh degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015); See Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union \nLocal 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. \n886 (1961). \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s tax problems began in 2014, when he chose to exempt all of his \nincome while working overseas as a defense contractor. Even temporarily, he had no \nright to do so, yet he did it anyway. His problems compounded when he failed to re-\nadjust his exemptions, and then when he failed to file his federal income tax returns, \nfirst in April 2015, then in April 2016, and again in April 2017. He took no action despite \nreceiving correspondence from the IRS about his overdue taxes and unfiled returns, \nand despite disclosing his tax issues on his June 2016 SCA. Only in 2017 did Applicant \nbegin to address the problem by hiring a tax preparer. Further, despite exempting all of \nhis income from federal taxes for three years, he failed to stockpile the money he owed \nfor the day his actions caught up to him. As a result, he had to pay the past-due taxes \nby cashing out his 401(k) pension. While that action cured the taxes he owed for tax \nyears 2014, 2015, and 2016, the tax consequences of that action have not yet been \ndetermined. \n \n \nApplicant hired a tax preparer to address his past-due returns and to pay his \npast-due taxes. The returns were filed in December 2017 and the past-due taxes paid in \n2019. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(g) both apply.  \n \n \nHowever, this does not end the analysis. After several years of having his income \nwrongly exempted from federal income taxes and taking no action to limit the scope of \nthe problem, Applicant was finally energized to address his overdue tax returns and tax \ndebt only during 2017, during the processing of his June 2016 SCA. As he \nacknowledged, filling out his SCA was what spurred him to act. The fact that Applicant \nacted only when his clearance was imperiled raises questions about his willingness to \nfollow the sometimes complex rules governing classified information when his personal \ninterests are not at stake. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-01070 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, \n2016). Further, even though Applicant has documented that he filed all his past-due \nreturns and paid all his past-due tax debt, I cannot simply adopt a position of \u201cno harm, \nno foul\u201d or \u201call\u2019s well that ends well.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, \n2015). AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply.  \n \n \nEven though Applicant has no outstanding tax debt or unfiled tax returns, he has \nnot established a track record of good-faith compliance with his tax requirements to \nshow that his prior tax issues are unlikely to recur or no longer cast doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness and judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not fully apply.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s tax issues were entirely self-created, as they were initiated by his \nmisguided attempt to game the system by attempting to exempt all of his income from \nfederal income taxes. Even temporarily, this was wrong. Applicant\u2019s problems worsened \nwhen he allowed the situation to perpetuate for several years, and when he failed to file \nhis federal income tax returns, as required, also for several years. Only during the \nsecurity clearance process did he begin to act. Applicant\u2019s demonstrated pattern of \nunwillingness to comply with his legal obligations until his eligibility for a security \nclearance was at stake raises serious security concerns. Even though Applicant has \nfiled all of the tax returns at issue and paid all of the tax debt, he still engaged in a \ncontinuous course of conduct that calls his judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability into \nquestion, along with his respect for rules and regulations. These characteristics are the \nunderpinnings of the security clearance process. Even though Applicant acknowledges \nhis errors and has addressed all of the allegations in the SOR, he has not provided \nsufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns that arose from his conduct. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \ncontinued eligibility for access to classified information. Applicant did not mitigate \nfinancial security concerns. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for continued access to \nclassified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n_____________________________ \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn February 8, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline K, handling protected information, and Guideline E, \npersonal conduct, explaining why it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant security clearance eligibility. The DOD CAF took the action under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; and DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive) and the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nOn May 9, 2019, Applicant answered the SOR, admitting the allegation set forth and \ncross-alleged in subparagraph 1.a and 2.b, and admitting, in part, and denying, in part, the \n\n2 \n \nallegation set forth in subparagraph 2.a. He requested a hearing and the case was \nassigned to me on August 2, 2019. On September 24, 2019, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing, scheduling Applicant\u2019s case for \nNovember 7, 2019. The hearing was held as scheduled. I received five Government \nexhibits (GE 1 \u2013 GE 5), together with five Applicant\u2019s exhibits (AE A \u2013 AE E), and a copy of \nthe discovery letter from Department Counsel to Applicant, dated June 20, 2019. (HE I) \nAlso, I considered the testimony of Applicant and a character witness. At the close of the \nhearing, I left the record open, upon Applicant\u2019s counsel\u2019s request, to allow him the \nopportunity to submit an additional exhibit. Within the time allotted, Applicant\u2019s counsel \nsubmitted a reference letter, which I incorporated into the record as AE F. On November \n19, 2019, I e-mailed the parties, expressing my intention to issue a summary disposition in \nfavor of Applicant. (HE II) Upon reconsideration, I have decided to forego issuing a \nsummary disposition, and have concluded that it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

Specifically, he made a number of \nerrors leading to \u201csystem failures, work stoppages, additional hours of labor of the \n[information technology] team, and [loss of] company money,\u201d (GE 5 at 1) including, \nimproperly configuring a system firewall, \u201cnot paying attention to detail when ordering hard \ndrives,\u201d and \u201cfailing to power on a server, causing [the staff] to waste an hour of time \n\n3 \n \ntroubleshooting why [they] couldn\u2019t connect to it.\u201d (GE 5 at 1) His most serious oversight led \nto the infection and disablement of the company\u2019s network by a crypto-virus -- a problem \nhis supervisor, shortly after the episode, characterized as an \u201cepidemic,\u201d with significant, \nongoing negative repercussions. (Id.) After a comprehensive network scan, the information \ntechnology team discovered that the source of the crypto-virus was an attachment that \nApplicant had received on his computer. When asked whether he opened the attachment, \nApplicant admitted previewing the message, acknowledging that this was the same as \nopening the file. (GE 5 at 1) When asked why he did not inform his supervisor of this \nproblem when it initially occurred, he responded that he was busy working on multiple tasks \nand \u201cjust didn\u2019t think anything of it.\u201d (GE 5 at 1) \n \n \nApplicant was consequently placed on a three-month probation for poor work \nperformance. (GE 5) Applicant\u2019s supervisor, in a letter dated August 11, 2016, placing him \non probation, characterized Applicant as \u201ca very loyal and hard worker\u201d whose performance \nhad deteriorated over the three to four months before the crypto-virus episode.\u201d (GE 5 at 1)  \n \n \nWhile on probation, Applicant inappropriately disclosed sensitive personnel \ninformation of company employees, including salary and benefit information, upon the \nrequest of another employee. (GE 3) Disgruntled because she suspected that she did not \nreceive as high of a raise as some coworkers, this employee, in mid-July of 2016, began \nasking Applicant to provide her with access to her coworkers\u2019 personnel files so that she \ncould compare her raise with their raises. Applicant initially refused. (Tr. 54) She \nsubsequently asked him for this information multiple times over the following two weeks. \n(Tr. 40)  He typically responded by either ignoring or deflecting her requests. (GE 4 at 4) \nApproximately the last week of August, Applicant relented and provided this information as \nrequested. (Tr. 39) A few days later, Applicant\u2019s supervisor discovered e-mail \ncorrespondence between Applicant and the disgruntled employee, leading him to suspect \nApplicant\u2019s misconduct. Subsequently, he confronted Applicant, who admitted the \nmisconduct, leading to his termination a few days later. (GE 2 at 2) \n \n \nApplicant admits that his work quality had begun deteriorating, as noted in the \nmemo from his supervisor. The deterioration of his work performance coincided with the \npressure of caring for his elderly grandparents, the severe illness of his 93-year-old \ngrandfather, whom Applicant was living with, in addition to  caring for, and the unexpected \ndeath of his brother in June 2016, almost two years to the date of his mother\u2019s death in \nJune 2014. (Tr. 31, 54; AE A) After his brother\u2019s death Applicant did not \u201cthink straight.\u201d (Tr. \n31) He suffered from insomnia, cried every night, and did not eat for days at a time. (Tr. 32) \nApplicant was further distracted because, as the next of kin, he was responsible for \nhandling the funeral arrangements and disposing of his brother\u2019s estate. (Tr. 15-16) \n \n \nApplicant was still in a depressed state of mind when the coworker began pressuring \nhim to disclose the sensitive information. He recognizes that he should have reported this \npressure, and that he should not have provided her with the requested information, but \nfailed to do so because his judgment was clouded by his depression. Applicant attributes \nhis significantly better work performance on successive jobs since the termination to his \n\n4 \n \ngradual recovery from the shock of his brother\u2019s death and the pressure of caring for his \ngrandfather. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s former supervisor at the job, from which Applicant was fired, wrote two \ncharacter reference letters for him. (AE A, AE F) He was aware of the issues in Applicant\u2019s \nlife that were causing him to be stressed and distracted at work. (AE A) In the former \nsupervisor\u2019s initial reference letter, he characterized Applicant as \u201cstress[ed] and \ndepressed to the point where he was acting on impulse rather than logic.\u201d (AE A)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s former supervisor submitted his second character reference, in his \npersonal capacity, after the hearing and before the close of the record. (AE F) He \ncharacterized Applicant as \u201ca victim of a plot masterminded by a vindictive and \nmanipulative employee . . . upset about her performance review and raise.\u201d Moreover, this \ndisgruntled employee was aware that Applicant was at a particularly vulnerable stage in his \nlife and took advantage of his \u201ckindhearted ways and easygoing personality\u201d to \u201cspecifically \ntarget him to achieve her mischievous plot.\u201d (AE F)   \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied together with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \n\n5 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive \nOrder 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline K: Handling Protected Information \n \n \nThe security concerns about handing protected information are set forth in AG \u00b6 13: \n \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information \u2013 which includes classified and other sensitive \ngovernment information, and proprietary information \u2013 raises doubt about an \nindividual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability to \nsafeguard such information, and is a serious security concern. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s intentional, inappropriate disclosure of sensitive personnel information to \nanother employee triggers the application of AG \u00b6 34(a), \u201cdeliberate or negligent disclosure \nof protected information to unauthorized persons, including, but not limited to, personal or \nbusiness contacts, the media, or persons present at seminars, meetings, or conferences.\u201d \nThe serious nature of Applicant\u2019s security violation was compounded by the fact that he \n\n6 \n \nwas on probation for poor work performance which, among other things, led to the \ndisablement of the network system and costs incurred by the company, when the episode \noccurred. Applicant\u2019s error which led to the disablement of the network system by a crypto-\nvirus was particularly egregious because he did not inform his supervisor of his error until \nconfronted. \n \n \n \nApproximately three and a half years have elapsed since the misconduct. Applicant \nhas excelled at both jobs where he worked since his termination. He characterizes his poor \nperformance and his intentional, unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information as an \nanomaly triggered by depression related to the unexpected loss of his brother and the \nstress of caring for elderly grandparents. \n \n \n\u201cSecurity violations are one of the strongest possible reasons for denying or \nrevoking access to classified information, as they raise very serious questions about an \napplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. \u201c (ISCR Case No. 97-0435 at 3-4 \n(App. Bd. July 14, 1998) As such, the court must apply a strict scrutiny standard of review, \nand indicators of a risk that an applicant might commit a security violation, alone, are \ndisqualifying. (ISCR Case No. 00-0030 at 7 (App. Bd. September 20, 2001)) Here, \nApplicant not only committed a security violation by divulging sensitive information; he did \nso while on probation for previous network security lapses. Consequently, the nature and \nseriousness of the security violation is extremely high. When Applicant was pressured into \ndivulging sensitive information, he was in a vulnerable state of mind because of his \ndepression related to various family crises. However, absent any clinical evidence \nsupporting his contention that he was depressed, or any clinical evidence addressing \nwhether he may become similarly careless if faced with future personal crises, any \nmitigation generated by the surrounding circumstances, the presence of rehabilitation, and \nthe passage of time since the security violation occurred, is insufficient to overcome the \nnature and seriousness of the conduct, given the higher standard of review. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) Although Applicant opened an email attachment containing a \ncrypto-virus, as alleged in subparagraph 1.a, and he did not tell his supervisor until \nconfronted, there is no record evidence that he deliberately sought to conceal his actions \nfrom his supervisor. I resolve subparagraph 2.a in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s unauthorized release of sensitive information, as alleged in \nsubparagraph 1.a and subparagraph 2.b, constitutes evidence sufficient to disqualify him \nunder the guideline governing handling protected information. Because the potentially \napplicable disqualifying conditions under the personal conduct guideline are predicated \nupon conduct that either is not sufficiently covered under another guideline, or conduct that \nis not sufficient for an adverse decision under any other guideline,  no further discussion is \n\n7 \n \nnecessary under the personal conduct guideline. Subparagraph 2.b is disqualifying for the \nsame reasons as it is disqualifying as cross-alleged in subparagraph 1.a. \n  \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the whole-person factors in my consideration of the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions set forth under Guidelines K and E. They do not warrant a favorable \nconclusion.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline K:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_____________________ \nMarc E. Curry \n Administrative Judge \n",

The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG), implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on August 14, 2019, and elected to have her \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. The Government submitted its \n\n \n2 \n \n \nwritten case on September 17, 2019. A complete copy of the file of relevant material \n(FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file objections \nand submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. Applicant \nreceived the Government\u2019s FORM on September 26, 2019. She did not respond to the \nGovernment\u2019s FORM. The case was assigned to me on November 22, 2019. The \nGovernment\u2019s documents identified as Items 1 through 7 are admitted in evidence \nwithout objection.    \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.e and admitted the \nremaining SOR allegations. She is 48 years old. She married in 2005 and divorced in \n2013. She has an adult child. (Items 2, 3). \n \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in 1991. She attended college from 2008 to \n2013 but did not earn a degree. She was unemployed from March to April 2004 and \nFebruary to July 2013. She held part-time seasonal employment from October to \nNovember 2016. As of her January 2017 security clearance application (SCA), she \nworked as a dispatcher for a DOD contractor since October 2016. She has never held a \nDOD security clearance. (Items 3, 4). \n \n  \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file her federal income tax returns for tax \nyears 2014, 2015, and 2016, as required. It also alleges that she has six delinquent \nconsumer debts, totaling $3,091. She listed her failure to file her relevant federal income \ntax returns and some of her delinquent consumer debt on her January 2017 SCA, and \ndiscussed her financial issues during her November 2017 interview with a background \ninvestigator and in her February 2019 response to interrogatories. Her delinquent \nconsumer debts are also reported on her 2017 and 2019 credit bureau reports. (Items 1, \n3, 4, 5, 6). \n \n \nApplicant attributed her financial predicament to her 2013 separation and \ndivorce. She stated in her response to the SOR that her divorce was an \u201cabrupt change \n[that] affected my finances tremendously and 6 years later I am still trying to recover.\u201d \nShe acknowledged that her \u201cfinances are in extreme disarray,\u201d but maintained that it \nwas not a reflection of her ability to do her job. She indicated during her background \ninterview that she divorced her husband because she was the primary caregiver and \nshe no longer wanted to be with him as he did not work for one and a half years. (Items \n2, 3, 4) \n \n \nApplicant also indicated in both her SCA and background interview that, \nunbeknownst to her until 2016, a previous employer made an erroneous change to her \nIRS Form W-4 for tax years 2013 to 2016. She stated that the previous employer listed \nher as having five dependents rather than one. She stated that she was waiting for that \nemployer to issue her corrected IRS Form W-2 for those tax years so that she could \n\u201crefile\u201d those income tax returns. (Items 2, 3, 4). \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nIn her response to interrogatories, Applicant stated that she had filed her 2014 \nfederal income tax return in January 2015, her 2015 and 2016 tax returns in April 2017, \nand her 2017 tax return in January 2018. She stated that the IRS intercepted her tax \nrefunds for tax years 2017 and 2018 and applied them to her outstanding taxes for tax \nyears 2015 and 2016. She also stated that she still owed $970 for tax year 2015 and \n$900 for tax year 2016, the latter of which she was delinquent by $106. She did not \nprovide documentation to corroborate her claims. IRS tax account transcripts from June \n2019, however, reflect that no tax returns had been filed for tax periods 2014 and 2015 \nas of February and October 2017, respectively. A June 2019 IRS tax account transcript \nfor tax period 2016 simply reflected, \u201cRequested Data Not Found.\u201d The transcripts also \nreflected that a tax return for tax period 2017 was filed in April 2018 and Applicant \nreceived a refund of $762. (Items 2, 3, 4, 5).  \n \n \nApplicant also discussed during her background interview a delinquent title loan \n(SOR \u00b61.b) and two delinquent credit cards (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e). She indicated that the \ncreditor for her title loan sold her car for $400 and she borrowed $500. She \nacknowledged that she could not afford to repay her title loan and it, as well as her two \ncredit cards, remained outstanding. She also indicated that she had not received any \ncredit counseling. She listed in her SCA that she traveled for pleasure to Ireland and the \nUnited Kingdom (UK) in February 2013, Ireland in March 2013, and the UK again in July \n2013. (Items 2, 3, 4). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file her federal income tax returns for tax years 2014 \nthrough 2016, as required. She was also unable to pay her debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), \nand 19(f) apply.  \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 and considered \nthe following relevant:  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \n \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control, as previously discussed, contributed to \nher financial problems. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), she must provide evidence \nthat she acted responsibly under the circumstances. Despite her claim in her February \n2019 response to interrogatories that she had filed her outstanding federal income tax \nreturns for tax years 2014 through 2016, IRS account tax transcripts from June 2019 \nreflect that no such returns had been filed for tax years 2014 and 2015 and does not \nprovide any information regarding whether she filed her tax return for tax year 2016. \nShe also failed to provide documentation to corroborate her claims. A person who fails \nrepeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08782 at 3 (App. \nBd. Apr. 5, 2017). In addition, she has not demonstrated that she has taken steps to \nresolve her delinquent consumer debt. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(d), and 20(g) \nare not established.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n",

(Item \n1.) The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Policy effective June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 29, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on November 6, 2019. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing that same day, and the hearing was convened as \nscheduled on December 5, 2019.  The Government offered eight exhibits, referred to as \nGovernment Exhibits 1 through 8, which were admitted without objection.  Applicant \noffered one exhibit, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A, which was admitted without \nobjection.  Applicant also testified on his own behalf. The record remained open until \nclose of business on December 12, 2019, to allow Applicant the opportunity to submit \n\n \n2 \n \nadditional supporting documentation.  Applicant submitted no additional documentation.  \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 16, 2019. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 53 years old.  He has been married for twenty-three years to his \nsecond wife.  He has four adult children.  He has a high school diploma and an \nAssociate\u2019s degree.  He is employed with a defense contractor as an Engineer \nTechnician.  He is applying for a security clearance in connection with his employment.  \nApplicant began working for his current employer in January 2019.      \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. The SOR \nidentified twenty-one separate allegations involving a variety of financial problems.  \nApplicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2010.  He failed to file his Federal income tax \nreturns for tax years 2007, 2010, 2014, and 2017.   The Government alleges that he \nowes a total of approximately $66,390 in delinquent Federal taxes.  Applicant believes \nthe total amount he owes in Federal back taxes is closer to approximately $22,000 or \n$23,000 dollars.  Applicant also failed to file his state income tax returns for tax years \n2009, and 2010, and 2014 through 2017.  He owes approximately $3,514 in delinquent \nstate taxes.  He has ten other delinquent debts totaling approximately $9,898.  Applicant \nadmits to each of the delinquent accounts listed in the SOR, except 1.j., 1.k., 1.l., 1.m., \n1.p., 1q., 1.r., 1.s., and 1.h.  Credit Reports of Applicant dated July 6, 2017; May 24, \n2018; and October 31, 2019, confirm the indebtedness listed in the SOR.  (Government \nExhibits 5, 6, and 7.)      \n \n \nApplicant served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from 1986 to October 2007 \nwhen he received an honorable discharge.  He retired as an E-6 culinary specialist.  \nDuring his military career, he deployed to many countries around the world, including \nJapan, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Abu Dhabi, Australia, Guam, \nHawaii, and Samoa.      \n \n \nApplicant testified that his financial problems snowballed over time because he \ndid not pay close attention to them while he was out at sea.  After retiring from the \nmilitary, he continued to live beyond his means.  Bills continued to come in, and he was \nunable to pay them.  By 2010 his financial problems were so out of his control, he filed \nfor Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  Matters were complicated because Applicant also failed to \nfile his Federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2009, 2010 and 2014, 2015, \n2016 and 2017.  Applicant stated that there was no good reason, he simply did not file \nhis income tax returns.  He explained that for years while in the military, when he filled \nout his W-4, he took out the maximum amount of exemptions he could, which left him \npaying very little in taxes.  Thus, he always owed a lot of taxes at the end of the year.  \n\n \n3 \n \nSince 2007, Applicant has changed his exemptions to prevent this problem.  He now \nunderstands the ramifications of doing this.  As of the hearing Applicant had still not filed \nthe Federal income tax returns in question.  (Tr. p. 32.)  Applicant had not filed his state \nincome tax returns in question ether.  (Tr. p. 36.)  However, he states that he has taken \ncare of his back taxes owed to the state.  Applicant testified that he has contacted \nseveral tax preparing agencies, but each time they took his money and were not \nsuccessful in getting his taxes filed.  His latest tax preparer has all of Applicant\u2019s \npaperwork, but has not yet filed his 2018 Federal and state income tax returns.  (Tr. p. \n37.)  \n \n \nApplicant also offered that from 2007 to 2009 he lived in Texas and he gambled \nat the racetrack quite a bit.  He was unemployed from February 2012 to May 2013; and \nfrom August 2015 to April 2016.  During those periods of unemployment, however, he \ncollected unemployment benefits, to live on.  He also received his military retirement as \nwell as his 90 percent VA disability.  (Tr. pp. 28-29.)  The following delinquent debts \nremain owing:   \n \n \n \n1.d. A Federal tax lien was entered against the Applicant in the amount of \napproximately of $21,286 for tax year 2007.  He states that he has not started paying on \nthis yet.  (Tr. p. 45.)     \n \n \n1.e. A Federal tax lien was entered against the Applicant in the amount of \napproximately $8,941 for tax year 2008.  (Government Exhibit 3.)  He states that he has \nnot started paying on this yet.  (Tr. p. 45.)   \n \n \n1.f. A Federal tax lien was entered against the Applicant in the amount of \napproximately $4,848 for tax year 2009.  (Government Exhibit 3.)  He states that he has \nnot started paying on this yet.  (Tr. p. 45.) \n \n \n1.g. A Federal tax lien was entered against the Applicant in the amount of \napproximately $1,837 for tax year 2010.  (Government Exhibit 3.)  He states that he has \nnot started paying on this yet.  (Tr. p. 45.) \n \n \n1.h. A Federal tax lien was entered against the Applicant in the amount of \napproximately $23,951 for tax year 2008.  (Government Exhibit 3.)  He states that he \nhas not started paying on this yet.  (Tr. p. 45.) \n \n \n1.i. A Federal tax lien was entered against the Applicant in the amount of \napproximately $5,527 for tax year 2011.  (Government Exhibit 3.)  He states that he has \nnot started paying on this yet.  (Tr. p. 45.) \n \n \n1.j and 1.k. Two state tax liens have been entered against the Applicant in the \namount of approximately $1,767 for tax year 2010; and in the amount of approximately \n$1,747 for tax year 2012.  In 2017, Applicant began following a regular payment plan of \n$500 monthly toward these debts.  He explained that it is automatically deducted out of \nhis payroll check on a monthly basis.  He has about four payments left until his state tax \nliens are paid in full and removed.  (Tr. p. 49.) \n\n \n4 \n \n \n1.l. and 1.m.  Applicant has a delinquent debt owed to a creditor in the amount of \n$285.  He believes this was for a credit card that he has since paid off.  He has not \nprovided any documentation to substantiate this pay-off.  Accordingly, it remains owing.     \n \n \n1.n Another delinquent debt owed to a creditor in the amount of approximately \n$2,600 was a loan that Applicant thought he made several payments on.  (Tr. p. 54.)  \nHe has not provided any documentation to substantiate these payments.  Accordingly, it \nremains owing. \n \n \n1.o. Another delinquent debt is owed to a creditor in the amount of $537.  This \nwas also a credit card. (Tr. p. 56.)  He has not provided documentation to substantiate \nany payments made to this creditor.  Accordingly, it remains owing. \n \n \n1.p. Another delinquent debt is owed to a creditor in the amount of approximately \n$4,346.  Applicant explained that this was a payday loan.  He started making payments \non it until September of 2019.  He stopped because he could no longer afford to make \nthe payments.  He believes that he currently owes about $1,800.  He plans to resume \npayments soon.  Accordingly, it remains owing.   \n \n \n1.q. Another delinquent debt is owed to a creditor in the amount of approximately \n$1,210.  Applicant states that he was using his GI Bill but the university asserted that \nthey never received payment, and the VA contends that Applicant received back pay to \npay the debt.  Applicant realizes that he owes the money.  He has not made any \nattempts to pay it yet.  (Tr. p. 59.)  Accordingly, it remains owing.  \n \n \n1.r Another delinquent debt is owed to a creditor in the amount of approximately \n$315.  This was a payday loan.  Applicant contends that this debt was paid in 2017 or \n2018.  (Tr. p. 59.)  He has not provide any documentation to substantiate this pay-off.  \nAccordingly, it remains owing. \n \n \n1.s. Another delinquent debt is owed to a creditor in the amount of approximately \n$100.  Applicant explained that this was an overdraft charge that he paid in 2017.  He \nhas not provide any documentation to substantiate this payment.  Accordingly, it \nremains owing. \n \n \n1.t and 1.u. Two delinquent debts owed to a creditor in the amounts of $85 and \n$135, remain owing.  He did not provide any documentation to substantiate any \npayments made to these creditors.  Accordingly, they remain owing.    \n \n \nApplicant states that in 2016, he received financial counseling from the Navy \nbase.  He hopes to clear up his finances in order to purchase a house.  He now knows \nhow to budget his money properly.  Since receiving this counseling he has decreased \nhis expenses.  To reduce his expenses, he states that he no longer has a vehicle and \nhas cut back on cable services. \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \n \n \nApplicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-OIP) dated April 27, 2017.  (Government Exhibit 1.)  In response to Section 26 \nconcerning his financial record, Applicant was asked a series of questions.  Specifically, \nin the past seven years, has he had a lien placed against his property for failing to pay \ntaxes or other debts?  Is he currently delinquent on any Federal debt?  The Applicant \nanswered, \u201cNO.\u201d  This was a false response.  Applicant failed to list the debts set forth \nunder Guideline F, in subparagraphs 1.d., through 1k. above.  This allegation is found \nagainst the Applicant, see discussion below.       \n \n \nOn the same questionnaire, in Section 26 concerning his financial record, \nApplicant was also asked, specifically, in the past seven years has he had bills or debts \nturned over to a collection agency?... Has he had any account or credit card suspended, \ncharged off or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed?  The Applicant answered, \u201cNO.\u201d  \nThese were also false responses.  Applicant failed to list the debts set forth under \nGuideline F, in 1.l, through 1.u. above.  This allegation is also found against the \nApplicant, see discussion below. \n \n \n \nA letter from the Applicant\u2019s supervisor is favorable and indicates that Applicant \nis very responsible and trustworthy on the job and is considered to be an ideal \nemployee.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)      \n \n        \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Four are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n  \nEvidence from his most recent credit report dated October 31, 2019, reveals that \nApplicant remains excessively indebted to most of the creditors listed in the SOR.  He \nadmits that he has not even started to address his Federal back taxes which he \nbelieves he owes in the amount of approximately $22,000 or $23,000.  He has failed to \nprovide any documentary evidence to show that any of debts are being addressed.  The \nrecord lacks appropriate documentation to substantiate the testimony he has provided.   \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so  long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangement. \n \n \nAlthough Applicant asserts that he is making payments toward several of his \ndebts, he has provided no receipts or proof of payment to substantiate his testimony.  \nOther than stating that he is paying his state back taxes, he has not provided any \nevidence in mitigation.  There is no documentary evidence to show that he has done \nanything to resolve his delinquent debt.  He has provided no reasonable explanation for \nthe delinquent debts, other than the fact that he has lived beyond his means, and did \nnot for many years pay close attention to what he was spending.  Furthermore, \nApplicant has not filed the Federal or state income tax returns in question.  Nor has he \neven started to address his Federal back taxes.  There is nothing in the record to \nindicate when or how his financial situation will be resolved, and whether it is likely to \n\n \n8 \n \nrecur.  There is nothing in the record to show that he has control of his finances and is \nliving within his means.  He remains excessively indebted.  Under the particular \ncircumstances here, Applicant has failed to establish that he has acted reasonably or \nresponsibly with respect to his debts.  Most importantly, it has not been demonstrated \nthat his current financial problems are under control.    \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern for the personal conduct guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I have \nconsidered each of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 below: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \n\n \n9 \n \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \n \n \nIn response to questions about his financial history, Applicant deliberately failed \nto reveal his delinquent debts on his security clearance application.  His credibility is in \nquestion.  His conduct does not show honesty, integrity, good judgment or reliability.  \nThese are necessary characteristics of an individual who has been entrusted with the \nnational secrets.  Given the large number of delinquent debts Applicant has, and the \nsizable amounts owed on the debts, Applicant knew or should have known that these \ndebts remained owing when he completed his security clearance application in 2017 \nand he should have revealed them to the Government.  If for some reason he did not \nknow, he should have checked his credit report before completing the application.  The \nfact that he did not acknowledge any of his debts in response to these questions on his \napplication, shows that he was either extremely careless, or he deliberately concealed \nthe information from the Government, which in either case indicates questionable \njudgment, unreliability, and untrustworthiness, characteristics of an individual who does \nnot meet the qualifications for access to classified information.     \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n10 \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F and Guideline E in my whole-person analysis.  Applicant failed to provide \ndocumentary evidence to support his testimony.  There is insufficient documentation in \nthe record to show that Applicant has made any effort to resolve or work toward \nresolving his delinquent debt.  Accordingly, Applicant has not demonstrated that he is \nfinancially responsible or sufficiently truthful or trustworthy to access classified \ninformation.          \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial Considerations and Personal \nConduct security concerns.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.u.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Edmunds, Esq. \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nNOEL, Nichole L., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant contests the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) intent to revoke his \neligibility for a security clearance to work in the defense industry. Although Applicant \nhas resolved three of the six debts alleged in the Statement of Reasons (SOR), he has \nfailed to demonstrate a track record of debt repayment and that his finances are under \ncontrol. Clearance is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn February 15, 2019, the DOD issued an SOR detailing security concerns \nunder the financial considerations guideline. This action was taken under Executive \nOrder (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, signed by \nPresident Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated \nJanuary 2, 1992, as amended (Directive), and the Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, implemented on June 8, \n2017.   \n \nDOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance and recommended that the case be \n\n \n2 \n \nsubmitted to a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge for \na determination whether to revoke his security clearance. Applicant timely answered the \nSOR and requested  a decision on the written record. Department Counsel completed a \nFile of Relevant Material on April 22, 2019. Applicant confirmed receipt of the document \non May 8, 2019. Applicant retained counsel and requested that his case be converted to \na hearing.  \n \nAt the hearing, convened on January 9, 2020, I appended the Government\u2019s \ndiscovery letter to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1. I admitted Government\u2019s \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 6, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through I, without objection. \nAfter the hearing, Applicant timely submitted AE J through S, which are also admitted \nwithout objection. The final exhibit list, which is certified as accurate and complete by \nboth parties, is appended to the record as HE II. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on \nJanuary 17, 2020.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant, 31, has worked as a security police officer for his current employer, a \nfederal contractor, since April 2012. He has worked in the physical security field since \n2009, when he was granted public trust eligibility. Applicant applied for his first security \nclearance in 2010. He was granted an interim clearance, but it was revoked because of \nhis derogatory financial history. As a result, Applicant was unemployed from March \n2011 until April 2012, when he was able to provide sufficient information to mitigate the \nconcerns raised by his financial history. DOD granted Applicant access to classified \ninformation in April 2012. Applicant completed his most recent security clearance \napplication in September 2015, seeking a higher level security clearance, which is \nrequired for another employment opportunity. He reported having delinquent student \nloan accounts. The ensuing background investigation revealed additional delinquent \naccounts, which form the basis of the SOR. The SOR alleged that Applicant owed over \n$29,000 on six delinquent accounts. He admitted owing each of the six alleged \naccounts. (Tr. 16-17, 28-30, 42-43, 50-53; Answer; GE 1) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began in his early 20s. Applicant attended college \nfrom 2006 to 2008. He withdrew from college, and began working full time to provide \nfinancial help to his mother as she raised Applicant\u2019s two younger sisters. On average, \nhe gave his mother one-third of his paycheck to help her with household expenses. He \nalso provided financial help to his grandmother, buying her groceries and prescription \nmedication, as needed. Applicant used student loans to pay for college, which were \nserviced by multiple companies. He became overwhelmed by his financial commitments \nand allowed the loans to go into default. In 2015, Applicant rehabilitated the loans and \nconsolidated them with one servicer. He kept the account current until December 2017, \nwhen he defaulted on the consolidated loan, which is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($19,696). \n(Tr. 21, 31-32, 53-56, 29; GE 1, 4-6) \n \n \nWhen Applicant began working as a security guard in 2009, he commuted the 40 \nmiles from his mother\u2019s home to his duty station. In 2013, Applicant moved to an \napartment closer to his duty station. Applicant, then 25, believed he was renting an \n\n \n3 \n \napartment for $1,100. When he arrived to sign the lease and move in, the rent was $600 \nmore than he expected. Believing he had no other options, Applicant went through with \nthe transaction, knowing that the rent was beyond his means. He lived in the unit for \nless than six months before breaking the lease and defaulting on the remaining rent \ndue. The balance on his lease is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e ($3,845). (Tr. 39-41, 50, 56, 60) \n \n \nBetween 2014 and 2017, Applicant went on six deployments to provide security \nat other sites. Because Applicant did not have a credit card, his lodging expenses were \ncharged to his supervisor\u2019s credit card. Applicant\u2019s employer deposited Applicant\u2019s per \ndiem allowance directly into his bank account. On one such deployment, the hotel would \nnot allow Applicant\u2019s supervisor to pay the hotel charges over the phone. Instead, \nApplicant\u2019s employer deposited the money for the hotel costs into Applicant\u2019s checking \naccount. Applicant testified that he became confused when the hotel payment, his per \ndiem allowance, and paycheck were deposited into his account, causing him to \noverdraft the account by over $4,000. The overdraft balance is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b \n($4,422). (Tr. 18, 32, 45-46, 61-62) \n  \nApplicant attributed his financial problems, in part, to his deployments. During his \ndeployments, which could last for months at a time, Applicant\u2019s mail would be delivered \nto his home and remain unopened until his return. As a result, Applicant missed due \ndates for his financial obligations, which caused his accounts to become delinquent. \nApplicant testified that he is now much better about managing his incoming mail. He has \ndeveloped a system for dealing with his mail during any prolonged periods of absence. \nHe also now organizes his mail by date and tries to open it timely to ensure he does not \nmiss any due dates for his financial obligations. (Tr. 19-20) \n \nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c ($1,351), 1.d ($180), and 1.f ($409) are for \ncredit cards. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c became delinquent in May 2017, and the \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.f became delinquent between July and August 2017. \nApplicant could not provide a reason as to why each account became delinquent other \nthan that he became overwhelmed and neglected to pay the accounts. He believes he \nused the credit cards to pay for car repairs on his older model car. (GE 4-6) \n \nSOR Debt Status \n \nSOR 1.a: After defaulting on the consolidated student loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, \nApplicant entered a loan rehabilitation program in January 2019. In January 2020, the \ncreditor extended Applicant a settlement offer, agreeing to accept $2,459.55 to satisfy \nover $34,000 in student loan debt.  He settled the account after the hearing. (Tr. 21, 23-\n24, 30; GE 4, AE D, J) \n \nSOR 1.b: Applicant claims to have paid $800 toward this debt, testifying that he \nmade $100 payments each month beginning in March 2019. However, the record does \nnot contain evidence of these payments. In January 2020, Applicant made two \npayments toward this debt, totaling $84. This account remains unresolved. He does not \nhave payment plan established for this debt, but expressed his intent to continue \nmaking payments toward its resolution. (Tr. 24-25, 32-33; GE 5; AE E, K) \n\n \n4 \n \nSOR 1.c: Applicant explained that he became overwhelmed with his bills and \nstopped making payments on this account. Between March and July 2019, Applicant \npaid $675.50 on this account. He received a settlement offer in November 2019 to \nsatisfy the account for a lump sum payment of $202.64. The offer expired on December \n31, 2019. When asked at hearing why he failed to resolve the account by the deadline, \nApplicant explained that he did not open the mail containing the offer until late \nDecember. He offered no explanation for his failure to open the letter, which he received \nbefore Thanksgiving, or his failure to pay the settlement amount by the December 31 \ndeadline. Applicant settled the account after the hearing. (Tr. 25-26, 35-37, 63-66; GE \n5-6; AE F, L) \n \nSOR 1.d:  In his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that he was making $50 \nmonthly payments toward this account. However, he did not provide evidence of those \npayments. At the hearing, he provided a receipt showing an account balance of $1,066 \nafter a payment of $25 made on the day of the hearing. After the hearing, Applicant \nsubmitted a second receipt, but the receipt does not contain any detailed payment \ninformation or provide an updated account balance. Applicant has not established a \npayment plan for this account, and it remains unresolved. (Tr. 26, 37-38; GE 5-6; AE G, \nM) \n \nSOR 1.e: This debt is the balance on the 2013 apartment lease. Between 2014 \nand May 2017, Applicant made monthly payments on this account, totaling $4,000. He \ndid not make any payments on the account after May 2017. In January 2020, he made \ntwo payments, totaling $130. This account remains unresolved. (Tr. 27, 14; GE 3; AE H, \nN)  \n \nSOR 1.f: There is no evidence that Applicant made any payment on the account \nafter it became delinquent in August 2018. Applicant settled this account before the \nhearing. (Tr. 27, 41-42; GE 5-6; AE I, O) \n \nApplicant earns approximately $70,000 annually, including regular and overtime \npay. He has over $5,000 in retirement savings, consisting entirely of the contributions \nmade by his employer. Applicant is single and has no children. He no longer provides \nregular financial support to his mother, but will give her money if she asks. Between \n2016 and 2017, Applicant worked with a credit counseling agency, paying them $100 \neach month, to verify and challenge entries on his credit record. Applicant also provided \nevidence that he enrolled in three financial/debt counseling programs. He submitted a \nbudget showing that he intends to make $100 monthly payments toward the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e. (Tr. 16-20, 35, 44, 63, 66, 71, 83, 85-86, 88; AE P-\nS) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n\n \n5 \n \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nFailure to meet one\u2019s financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information. (AG \u00b6 18). The record establishes the Government\u2019s prima \n\n \n6 \n \nfacie case that Applicant owed over $29,000 in delinquent debt. The credit reports in the \nrecord as well as Applicant\u2019s admissions establish that Applicant has demonstrated a \nhistory of not paying his financial obligations. Financial considerations disqualifying \ncondition AG \u00b6 19(c) applies.  \n \nApplicant receives credit for resolving the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and \n1.f. However, this is not enough to mitigate the security concerns raised by his history of \nfinancial problems. While Applicant\u2019s youth and inexperience may have accounted for \nthe financial problems at the beginning of his career, his current financial problems are \nplagued by lack of attention to detail, more than an inability to pay. Applicant did not \nestablish that his finances are under control. He did not present sufficient information to \nsupport a finding that he is unlikely to incur delinquent debt in the future. His actions \nafter the hearing, resolving three of the alleged delinquent accounts and his promise to \npay the remaining three in the future do not constitute a good-faith effort to repay his \ncreditors. Although Applicant has enrolled in three different financial counseling \nprograms, he failed to demonstrate any change in the financial habits that caused him \nto accumulate delinquent accounts over the past decade. Accordingly, none of the \nfinancial considerations mitigating conditions apply.  \n \nBased on the record, doubts remain about Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to \nclassified information. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-\nperson factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant has failed to mitigate the concerns raised by his \nhistory of financial problems. Although Applicant settled three of the six alleged \naccounts after the hearing, the resolution of specific financial obligations is not the point \nof this examination. Security clearance adjudications are not debt collection exercises. \nThe purpose is to determine if an Applicant\u2019s overall financial history presents a security \nrisk. As a young adult, Applicant took on significant financial responsibility to help \nsupport his family, and in doing so, made some poor financial decisions. However, he \nhas been aware since he first applied for access to classified information in 2010, that \ngovernment views delinquent debt as a security concern. Since then, Applicant has not \ndemonstrated financial rehabilitation or reform. He continued to accumulate delinquent \ndebt after completing his security clearance application in 2015. While Applicant stated \nhis intent to resolve his remaining delinquent accounts, he did not present a plan for \ndoing so.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c, and .1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline G, the Government alleged that Applicant consumed alcohol, at times to excess, from the time he was a teenager until at least 2016, and that he still consumes alcohol (SOR 1.a). It was further alleged that between 2006 and 2013, he was arrested on six occasions for driving while intoxicated (DWI) and other charges incidental to his DWI arrests (SOR 1.b \u2013 1.g). Under Guideline J, the Government alleged that between June 2001 and August 2012, Applicant was cited, charged, or arrested 11 times for various moving violations, failure to appear in court, and driving on a suspended license (SOR 2.a \u2013 2.k); and that in March 2018, Applicant was cited for speeding, to which he pleaded nolo contendere (SOR 2.l). Additionally, the DWI arrests alleged at SOR 1.b \u2013 1.g were cross-alleged as criminal conduct (SOR 2.m). Under Guideline E, the allegations at SOR 1.a \u2013 1.g (SOR 3.a) and at SOR 2.a \u2013 2.m (SOR 3.b) were cross-alleged as adverse personal conduct (SOR 2.m). Additionally, it was alleged that Applicant falsified his answer to the first question in e-QIP Section 24 (Alcohol Use) by listing a DWI arrest in January 2007 but failing to list all of the DWI arrests delineated in SOR 1.b \u2013 1.g (SOR 3.c). 3 In response to the SOR, Applicant denied SOR 3.c, but admitted all of the remaining SOR allegations.

Additionally, his positive change in personal and \nprofessional circumstances, combined with the moderation of his alcohol usage and with \nthe passage of time since any adverse conduct, are sufficient to mitigate the security \nconcerns about his use of alcohol, his criminal conduct, and his personal conduct. His \nrequest for a security clearance is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn July 13, 2017, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain eligibility for a security clearance required for \nhis employment with a federal contractor. Based on the results of the ensuing background \ninvestigation, Department of Defense (DOD) adjudicators could not determine that it is \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant to have a security \nclearance, as required by Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Section E.4, and \nby DOD Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive), Section 4.2. \n  \n \nOn July 31, 2019, DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that \nraise security concerns under the adjudicative guidelines for alcohol consumption \n(Guideline G), criminal conduct (Guideline J), and personal conduct (Guideline E). The \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) cited in the SOR were issued by the Director of National \nIntelligence on December 10, 2016, to be effective for all adjudications on or after June \n8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing. I \nreceived the case on November 25, 2019, and convened the requested hearing on \nJanuary 28, 2020. Department Counsel proffered Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 6, which \nwere admitted without objection. Applicant appeared as scheduled and testified. I \nreceived a transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 6, 2020. \n \n \nWithout objection, I held the record open after the hearing to receive additional \nrelevant information from Applicant. (Tr. 48 \u2013 51) The record closed on February 14, 2020, \nafter I received Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions and Department Counsel\u2019s waiver \nof objection thereto. They have been admitted without objection as Applicant Exhibits \n(AX) A \u2013 E. The emails that forwarded those exhibits to me are included in the record as \nHearing Exhibit (HX 3). HX 1 is the Index of Government Exhibits. HX 2 is a copy of \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s Discovery Letter, dated November 15, 2019. (Tr. 15 \u2013 25) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nUnder Guideline G, the Government alleged that Applicant consumed alcohol, at \ntimes to excess, from the time he was a teenager until at least 2016, and that he still \nconsumes alcohol (SOR 1.a). It was further alleged that between 2006 and 2013, he was \narrested on six occasions for driving while intoxicated (DWI) and other charges incidental \nto his DWI arrests (SOR 1.b \u2013 1.g). \n \n \nUnder Guideline J, the Government alleged that between June 2001 and August \n2012, Applicant was cited, charged, or arrested 11 times for various moving violations, \nfailure to appear in court, and driving on a suspended license (SOR 2.a \u2013 2.k); and that \nin March 2018, Applicant was cited for speeding, to which he pleaded nolo contendere \n(SOR 2.l). Additionally, the DWI arrests alleged at SOR 1.b \u2013 1.g were cross-alleged as \ncriminal conduct (SOR 2.m). \n \n \nUnder Guideline E, the allegations at SOR 1.a \u2013 1.g (SOR 3.a) and at SOR 2.a \u2013 \n2.m (SOR 3.b) were cross-alleged as adverse personal conduct (SOR 2.m). Additionally, \nit was alleged that Applicant falsified his answer to the first question in e-QIP Section 24 \n(Alcohol Use) by listing a DWI arrest in January 2007 but failing to list all of the DWI \narrests delineated in SOR 1.b \u2013 1.g (SOR 3.c). \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \n \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant denied SOR 3.c, but admitted all of the \nremaining SOR allegations. He also provided an attached statement in which, inter alia, \nhe explained his denial of SOR 3.c. In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 36 years old and employed as a software engineer for a large defense \ncontractor. He grew up in State A, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in \ncomputer science and mathematics in May 2016. In June 2017, Applicant was hired by \nhis current employer while completing graduate studies and working on a dissertation for \nhis Master of Science degree in computer science. He became a full-time employee the \nday he received his Master\u2019s degree in December 2017. Applicant established an \nexcellent academic record in college, graduating magna cum laude. As a graduate \nstudent, he compiled a 3.75 GPA. In June 2017, Applicant moved from State A to State \nB, his current residence, to accept the defense contractor position he now holds. During \nthe summer of 2014, Applicant held a security clearance required for his internship with \na federal agency. (GX 1; GX 2; AX B; Tr. 7, 9, 48). \n \n \nAs alleged in SOR 1.a, Applicant began consuming alcohol, at times to excess, as \na teenager. Between high school and July 2013, his use of alcohol resulted in the \nconvictions for DWI and related charges delineated in SOR 1.b \u2013 1.g. Applicant last used \nalcohol to excess in June 2016, but he still consumes alcohol in moderation in social \nsettings. He never has been diagnosed with any alcohol use disorder, such as being \nalcohol dependent. His DWI sentences have not resulted in more than a few days in jail \nawaiting initial court appearances, and he has completed court-ordered alcohol safety \nawareness classes on multiple occasions. Those classes included evaluations of his \nalcohol use and did not result in any clinical diagnoses. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 5; Tr. 32 \u2013 41, \n52 \u2013 55) \n \n \nAs alleged at SOR 2.a \u2013 2.l, Appellant committed numerous traffic violations, \nranging from simple speeding to reckless driving between 2001 and 2018. He also was \ncited for various technical infractions, such as improper insurance, and defective \nequipment and devices. On four occasions, Appellant was charged with failure to appear \nin response to traffic citations. On four other occasions, he also was charged with driving \non an expired or suspended driver\u2019s license. Applicant did not commit any such violations \nbetween 2012 and March 2018, when he pleaded nolo contendere to driving 55 mph in a \n45 mph zone in State B. That most recent traffic violation occurred in State B, six years \nafter his last violation in State A. Although all of the SOR 2.a \u2013 2.l allegations involved \nviolations of law, none of them resulted in arrest as alleged. Only the allegation at SOR \n2.m, which cross-alleged the DWIs addressed in SOR 1.b \u2013 1.g involved conduct for \nwhich Applicant faced possible incarceration. In early 2017, when Applicant was first \nbeing considered for his current job, he did not own a car or hold a valid driver\u2019s license \nbecause of his many traffic violations before 2012. To have his State A driving privileges \nrestored, Applicant researched and satisfied all outstanding requirements in State A \nbefore moving to State B. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; GX 4 \u2013 6; Tr. 36, 47 \u2013 48) \n \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant denied that he intended to falsify his answers to e-QIP Section 24 (Use \nof Alcohol) questions by omitting adverse information about his DWIs. When he submitted \nhis e-QIP, Applicant disclosed as required by Section 22 (Police Record) nearly all of the \nnon-DWI traffic offenses that occurred in the seven years preceding the e-QIP. In that \nsame section, Applicant also listed the DWI offenses alleged at SOR 1.f and 1.g. At e-\nQIP Section 24, he stated that alcohol had a negative impact in the previous seven years \ndue to multiple DWIs between 2007 and 2013. The only DWI he did not disclose was the \noldest offense from December 2006. Applicant claimed that, at most, he misunderstood \nwhat was required in Section 24. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 25, 27, 41 \u2013 42) \n \n \nApplicant was candid and forthright in his testimony. In response to the adverse \ninformation presented by the Government, Applicant admitted the accuracy of the \nallegations. He also acknowledged that before his last DWI arrest in 2013, he behaved \nirresponsibly by drinking too much and generally disregarding rules and regulations about \ndriving and other societal norms. He had matriculated at a state university in the fall of \n2002 but left after a semester. By contrast, Applicant described two events in 2013 as a \nturning point in his life. Although he re-enrolled in college in the spring of 2013, his risky \nlifestyle and poor choices continued. But the day he was released from jail after his May \n2013 DWI arrest, he learned his infant cousin had died suddenly. A few months later, \nwhen Applicant was arrested for his last DWI, he had been drinking at a party celebrating \nhis great grandmother\u2019s 100th birthday. She died soon after and Applicant claims he \nrealized he had to change his life for the better. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 26 \u2013 29) \n \n \nAfter July 2013, Applicant\u2019s alcohol use declined markedly and he was last \nintoxicated in June 2016. Applicant has not driven after having anything to drink since his \nJuly 2013 arrest, but he admits that before then he drove drunk on a number of occasions \nwithout being stopped. Applicant still consumes alcohol, albeit, on infrequent social \noccasions and only in moderation. He also avers that he leads a more active lifestyle \ncharacterized by physical fitness activities, and that his job and his volunteer work are not \nconducive to a lifestyle that includes more than moderate and responsible drinking. \n(Answer; GX 2; Tr. 29 \u2013 35, 38 \u2013 41) \n \n \nAfter re-enrolling in college, Applicant established a superior academic record and \ngraduated on time with a 3.5 cumulative GPA. He compiled a 3.75 GPA for his post-\ngraduate degree. During his undergraduate career, Applicant\u2019s academic record qualified \nhim as an ambassador in the White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and \nUniversities (HBCU). Currently, he is a member of the National Black Engineers \nAssociation and volunteers as a mentor to middle and high school students in State B. In \nthe workplace, Applicant has earned more than ten awards for his technical expertise and \nteamwork. He also logs significant hours of his own time through company-sponsored \nvolunteer programs. He has a reputation for integrity, reliability, and professionalism. After \ninitially being granted interim access to classified information, Applicant demonstrated \nthat he was able and willing to protect such information. (AX A \u2013 E; Tr. 32, 42 \u2013 47) \n \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are:  \n \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988))  \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe adverse information about Applicant\u2019s consumption of alcohol and alcohol-\nrelated misconduct reasonably raised the security concern stated at AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \n \nApplicant consumed alcohol, at times to excess, for about nine years. During that \ntime, he was arrested and convicted of alcohol-related crimes six times. This information \nrequires application of the following AG \u00b6 22 disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nand \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \n \n \nBy contrast, Applicant\u2019s use of alcohol now is infrequent and moderate. He was \nlast intoxicated almost four years ago, and he has not been involved in any alcohol-related \nmisconduct for almost seven years. He has never been diagnosed as alcohol dependent \nor as having any other alcohol use disorder. Further, Applicant\u2019s positive changes in his \npersonal and professional life are not conducive to the same level of involvement with \nalcohol in which he engaged up until 2016. This information requires application of the \nfollowing AG \u00b6 23 mitigating conditions: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; and \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations. \n \n \nThe record evidence as a whole regarding Applicant\u2019s past use of alcohol, and the \nmore recent changes in his lifestyle that are conducive to more moderate social alcohol \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nconsumption, support a conclusion that he is unlikely to engage in alcohol-related \nmisconduct, or to abuse alcohol in the future. All of the foregoing is sufficient to support \na conclusion that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns under this guideline. \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \n \nBetween June 2001 and March 2018, Applicant was cited for numerous traffic \nviolations, some as serious as reckless driving, and with various technical violations of \nstate traffic ordinances. He also was charged with failing to appear in response to various \ncitations. Along with his six DWI arrests and convictions, the Government\u2019s information \nreasonably raised a security concern about criminal conduct that is expressed at AG \u00b6 \n30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n \nMore specifically, the record requires application of the following AG \u00b6 31 \ndisqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n \n \nI also have considered the following AG \u00b6 32 mitigating conditions: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related misconduct between 2007 and 2013, as well as his \nlengthy record of lesser traffic-related offenses, are not in dispute. However, Applicant \nhas not engaged in such misconduct or poor judgment in almost seven years. His \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \ndrinking, which was at the heart of his most serious offenses, is no longer a security \nconcern. The other offenses alleged under this guideline reflected his unwillingness or \ninability between 2001 and 2012 to abide by basic legal obligations. Since 2013, \nApplicant\u2019s circumstances have undergone a significant and positive transformation. I am \nmindful of the need to avoid examining facts in a piecemeal fashion; however, the record \nevidence as a whole shows that Applicant\u2019s traffic violation in March 2018 should not be \nviewed as a continuance of the misconduct and poor judgment he demonstrated up to \nJuly 2013. Since 2013, Applicant has earned two degrees through superior academic \nperformance, and he has relocated to State B for his current work in the defense industry. \nApplicant has excelled in his work and he has become active as a volunteer and example \nfor local students. Finally, Applicant\u2019s lifestyle is characterized by his engagement in \nproductive activities that augment his professional life in a way that makes it unlikely that \nhe will commit even the most minor of criminal offenses. All of the foregoing supports \napplication of the mitigating conditions listed above. I conclude the security concerns \nunder this guideline are mitigated. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nApplicant denied the allegation that he falsified his answers to e-QIP Section 24 \n(Use of Alcohol); however, to be disqualifying it must be shown that his omissions were \ndeliberate and intended to conceal the facts or to mislead the government about those \nfacts. To that end, I have considered AG \u00b6 16(a): \n \ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nI conclude from all of the information probative of Applicant\u2019s intent at the time he \ncompleted his e-QIP that he reasonably believed his answers were truthful. Available \ninformation shows that Applicant did not improperly answer the questions in e-QIP \nSection 24 (Use of Alcohol) as alleged at SOR 3.c. At worst, he may have misinterpreted \nwhat information the question required. While the only specific DWI he listed in Section \n24 was his first offense in 2007, Applicant disclosed that alcohol had a negative impact \non his life between 2007 and 2013. From his description of the ramifications from those \ncharges, it is reasonable to conclude that he was referring to all of his DWI arrests. Earlier \nin the e-QIP (Section 22 \u2013 Police Record), he had already listed all of the DWIs that had \noccurred in the preceding seven years. His oldest DWI fell outside that time frame. He \nalso disclosed most of the other offenses addressed under the Criminal Conduct section \nof the SOR. The record evidence as a whole shows that Applicant did not intend to \nconceal any relevant or material information when he submitted his e-QIP. Any security \nconcerns raised by the Government\u2019s information about Applicant\u2019s truthfulness are \nresolved for Applicant. \n \n\n \n \n9 \n \n \n Nonetheless, information about Applicant\u2019s long record of misconduct and misuse \nof alcohol, as cross-alleged in SOR 3.a and 3.b reasonably raised a security concern \nabout personal conduct stated, in relevant part, at AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \n \nMore specifically, information supporting the SOR allegations about Applicant\u2019s \nabuse of alcohol and alcohol-related criminal conduct, as well as the 12 other allegations \nof lesser criminal conduct and violations of traffic ordinances, require application of the \nfollowing AG \u00b6 16 disqualifying conditions: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: . . . (2) any disruptive, violent, \nor other inappropriate behavior; and (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule \nviolations. \n \n \nIn weighing the scope of Applicant\u2019s misconduct, because of the evidence \nreflecting Applicant\u2019s change of circumstances after 2013, I specifically exclude from this \ndiscussion Applicant\u2019s 2018 traffic citation. In assessing the security significance of \nApplicant\u2019s conduct up to July 2013, as well as his use of alcohol since then, I find \napplicable the following AG \u00b6 17 mitigating conditions: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n\n \n \n10 \n \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \n \nFor the same reasons provided in support of mitigation under Guidelines G and E, \nI conclude Applicant\u2019s information is sufficient to mitigate the security concerns under this \nguideline.  \n \nI also evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \n\u00b6 2(d). The information probative of these factors is significant. Applicant\u2019s past \nmisconduct, alcohol use, and criminal conduct are no longer indicative of his current \njudgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. I also note Applicant\u2019s candid testimony and his \nacceptance of responsibility for his past actions. A fair and commonsense assessment of \nthe record evidence as a whole shows that the doubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability for a \nsecurity clearance that were raised by the Government\u2019s information have been resolved. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.g:  \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.m:  \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a \u2013 3.c:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant to have \naccess to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n                                 \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n       \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR 1.a through 1.g, with explanations. He denied 1.h, averring that the account belongs to his wife. Applicant, 56 years old, was born in India in 1964.

Eligibility for security clearance \naccess is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 2, 2016, Applicant signed and certified an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) application for a security clearance. On July 29, 2017, \nApplicant provided an interview to an investigator from the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM). Following a preliminary review of Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, the Department of Defense (DOD) could not make the preliminary affirmative \nfindings required to grant a security clearance. DOD issued to Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR), dated April 30, 2019, detailing security concerns under the guideline \nfor foreign influence (Guideline B). The action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective June 8, 2017.  \n\n  2 \n \n \nApplicant provided his notarized answer on May 28, 2019.

The hearing was held as scheduled. The Government\u2019s two exhibits (GE) 1 and \n2, and Applicant\u2019s 21 exhibits, (AE) A at 1-21, were entered into evidence without \nobjection. One hearing exhibit (HE) 1 (administrative notice) was marked. On October 7, \n2019, Applicant submitted a one-two-page document that was entered into evidence \nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) and the record closed on October \n17, 2019. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nI have taken administrative notice of certain relevant facts related to the Republic \nof India. These facts come from source material published by the Department of State \nand Department of Justice. The facts are limited to matters of general knowledge and \nnot subject to reasonable dispute.  \n \nRulings on Procedure \n \n \nAt the beginning of the hearing, Applicant objected to the September 2019 PSI \n(GE 2). After the Government recommended a recess for Applicant to review the \nexhibit, Applicant\u2019s attorney withdrew his objection to the exhibit. GE 1 and 2 were \nadmitted into evidence. \n \n \nDuring cross-examination of Applicant, testimony about Applicant\u2019s nephew \nprompted the Government to amend the SOR with the addition of the following \nallegation: 1.i - \u201cYour nephew (your 65-year-old brother\u2019s son) is a citizen and resident \nof India.\u201d Applicant objected based on the lack of notice and the nephew does not work \nfor the Indian government. The objection was overruled and the amendment was \ngranted.

The \nUnited States and India share common values such as the rule of law, respect for \ndiversity, and a democratic form of government. In 2009, the United States and India \nintroduced a strategic dialogue with the objective of strengthening cooperation in \nseveral areas, including energy, climate change, trade, education, and counterterrorism. \nThe US and India are committed to combatting money laundering and terrorism \nfinancing.  \n \n \nIndia is considered an active countries involved in economic and industrial \nespionage. The country is among the most active in US trademark counterfeiting and \ncopyright privacy. The Indian states of Jammu and Kashmir continue to grapple with \nterrorist and insurgent incidents. Active ant-western terrorist groups, including Islamist \nextremist groups target public places frequented by Americans and other westerners.  \n \n \nIndian security forces continue to violate human rights with extrajudicial killings, \ntorture, rape, and pervasive corruption at all government levels. \n\n  5 \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which are flexible \nrules of law, apply together with common sense and the general factors of the whole-\nperson concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \n \nAnalysis \n \nForeign Influence \n \nAG \u00b6 6 sets forth the security under Guideline B: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nConditions under AG \u00b6 7 that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \ninclude: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \n\n  6 \n \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology.  \n \n \n \nContacts and ties to family members who are citizens of a foreign country do not \nautomatically disqualify an applicant from security clearance access. As set forth under \nAG \u00b6 7(a), the contacts are only disqualifying if they create a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation. As set forth in AG \u00b6 7(b), connections are only disqualifying if they create a \npotential conflict of interest between Applicant\u2019s security duties and his desire to assist \nhis foreign family member. As the guideline indicates, the country in question must be \nconsidered. Terrorist organizations, including the Taliban and al-Qaeda, continue to \noperate against the United States and Afghan interests within the country. Afghanistan \nhas a poor human rights record that is adversely affected by the country\u2019s terrorism and \nviolence. Applicant\u2019s parents, his sister, his uncle and his brother-in-law are citizens and \nresidents of Afghanistan. His uncle is a professor at a government-operated university. \nApplicant\u2019s brother is a citizen of Afghanistan and resident of Germany where he is \nattending school. He contacts his parents on a weekly to occasional basis by phone. His \ncontact with his siblings is quarterly. Applicant\u2019s contact with his uncle was annual until \ntwo and one-half years ago.  \n \nApplicant provides at least $200 a month to his parents because they are elderly with \nhealth problems. They are not employed and receive no pension or retirement benefit. \nApplicant\u2019s financial help to his parents demonstrates his love and affection for them, \nbut is also a potential tool for manipulation and pressure by a terrorist insurgent or \ngovernment operative to exert pressure on him through a family member. The level of \ncontacts that Applicant has with his family members in Afghanistan, combined with the \nlevel of continuing violence committed by the Taliban and other terrorist groups against \nthe Afghan government, Afghan citizens, U.S. interests, and those who cooperate and \nassist the United States military, create a heightened risk of foreign influence under AG \n\u00b6 7(a). AG \u00b6 7(b) is applicable because Applicant\u2019s connections to his foreign family \nmembers create  potential conflict of interest between his obligation to protect classified \nor sensitive information or technology and his desire to help that his family members by \nproviding that information.  \n \n \nConditions under AG \u00b6 8 that could mitigate security concerns include: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \n\n  7 \n \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \n \n \n \nExcept for Applicant\u2019s uncle, none of Applicant\u2019s other family members are \naffiliated with the Afghan government or military. Although his uncle is employed as a \nprofessor at university operated by the government, Applicant has not spoken to him for \ntwo and one-half years, and has intentionally not contacted to him to eliminate any \nchance of disclosing his location in the country. Nevertheless, the level of contact with \nhis foreign family members precludes the applicability of AG \u00b6 8(a). AG \u00b6 8(c) does not \napply because foreign contacts between an applicant and his foreign family members \nare not considered casual and infrequent. I do not consider his regular telephonic \ncontact with his family members to be casual and infrequent.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) applies based in large part on his contributions to the national security of the \nUnited States. The DOHA Appeal Board has held that, as opposed to simple statements \nof intent which carry little weight, an applicant\u2019s demonstrated willingness to place \nhimself at risk for United States defense interests is significant evidence that can justify \na favorable result in a Guideline B case. See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 2 (App. \nBd. Feb. 5, 2008); ISCR Case No. 04-02511 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 20, 2007); ISCR Case \nNo. 10-05329 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 17, 2011). The Appeal Board explained that an \napplicant\u2019s service to the United States at the risk of his own safety as important \nevidence to show that he could be expected to resolve any conflict in favor of U.S. \ninterests. See ISCR Case No. 06-25928 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 9, 2008). Here, at least 14 \ncharacter references indicate that Applicant has faithfully and courageously supported \nU.S. forces since 2004. On many occasions before and after he immigrated to the \nUnited States, he executed his linguist responsibilities in difficult combat zones within \nAfghanistan. His continuing support of U.S. forces demonstrates that he is unlikely to \ncapitulate to potential pressure related to his family members living in Afghanistan. \nBased on his 13-year record of service to U.S. forces, at times putting U.S. interests \nahead of his own safety, I conclude that he will resolve any further conflict of interest in \nfavor of the United States. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nI have examined the evidence under the foreign influence guideline in the context of the \nnine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n\n  8 \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for access to \nclassified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \nFollowing completion of an Afghan high school in 2001, Applicant began working in the \ncountry in 2004 as a local national interpreter for the U.S. military. In 2007, he applied \nfor an SIV to the United States, and he immigrated to the United States in 2008 as he \ncontinued to work as a cultural advisor and linguist for the U.S. military. He became a \nU.S citizen in March 2014. Applicant continues to provide linguist services in \nAfghanistan for the U.S. military. The impressive character references from U.S. \ncommissioned and non-commissioned officers, the certificates of achievement and \nappreciation, along with Applicant\u2019s growing ties to the United States, demonstrate that \nApplicant will resolve any conflict of interest in favor U.S. interests. Considering the \nevidence from an overall commonsense point of view, Applicant has met his heavy \nburden of mitigating the security concerns based on the foreign influence guideline. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline B):  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.i: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant Applicant \neligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted.   \n \n \n_________________ \nPaul J. Mason \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He denied allegation 2.a, since his wife is now an American citizen. A copy of her American passport is attached to his Answer. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact. 3 Applicant is a 32-year-old native-born American citizen. He is married, with one child and one stepchild. He is applying for national security eligibility for a security clearance in connection with his employment at an overseas location with a defense contractor as a computer operator. Applicant served on active duty with the US Army from 2006 to 2013, when he received an Honorable Discharge. (Item 3 at Sections 13A, 15, 17, and 18.) Paragraph 1 \u2013 Guideline F (Financial Considerations) The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Applicant admitted owing the debts set forth in SOR subparagraphs 1.a through 1.e, with qualifications and explanations. The total amount of past-due indebtedness Applicant is alleged to owe is approximately $32,000.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \n\n \n2 \n \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, effective within the \nDepartment of Defense on June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant notarized his Answer to the SOR (Answer) on May 10, 2019, and \nrequested his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. (Item 2.) On \nJune 5, 2019, Department Counsel submitted the Department=s written case. A \ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), consisting of Items 1 to 8, was \nprovided to Applicant, who received the file on July 2, 2019. \n \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted eight Items in support of the SOR allegations. \nItem 5 is inadmissible. It is the summary of unsworn interviews of Applicant conducted \nby an interviewer from the Office of Personnel Management on April 3, and April 25, \n2018. Applicant did not adopt the summary as his own statement, or otherwise certify it \nto be accurate. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20, this Report of Investigation (ROI) summary is \ninadmissible in the Government\u2019s case in chief in the absence of an authenticating \nwitness. (See Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 5.) In light of Applicant\u2019s admissions, Item 5 is \nalso cumulative. Applicant is not legally trained and might not have understood \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s FORM commentary, which described the potential admissibility \nof Item 5. I therefor reviewed it for any potentially mitigating information that Applicant \nmight have thought would be considered. Any such mitigating information will be \ndiscussed later in this decision. \n \n \nApplicant was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and \nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He submitted additional \ninformation. Department Counsel had no objection, and the additional information is \nadmitted into evidence as Applicant Exhibit A. The case was assigned to me on August \n20, 2019. Based upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, national security eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \n \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \n \nThe Government requested in writing that I take administrative notice of certain \nfacts relating to the Republic of the Philippines (the Philippines). Department Counsel \nprovided a six-page summary of the facts, supported by five Government documents \npertaining to the Philippines, identified as Item 8. The documents provide elaboration \nand context for the summary. I take administrative notice of the facts included in the \nU.S. Government reports. They are limited to matters of general knowledge, not subject \nto reasonable dispute. They are set out in the Findings of Fact.  \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a through 1.e, and 2.b through 2.d, with \nexplanations. He denied allegation 2.a, since his wife is now an American citizen. A \ncopy of her American passport is attached to his Answer. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact.  \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant is a 32-year-old native-born American citizen. He is married, with one \nchild and one stepchild. He is applying for national security eligibility for a security \nclearance in connection with his employment at an overseas location with a defense \ncontractor as a computer operator. Applicant served on active duty with the US Army \nfrom 2006 to 2013, when he received an Honorable Discharge. (Item 3 at Sections 13A, \n15, 17, and 18.) \n \nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \n \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for \nclearance because he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, \nuntrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing the debts set forth in SOR subparagraphs 1.a through \n1.e, with qualifications and explanations. The total amount of past-due indebtedness \nApplicant is alleged to owe is approximately $32,000. The existence and amount of the \ndebts are documented by credit reports dated July 21, 2016; June 13, 2018; and \nJanuary 24, 2019. (Items 4, 6, and 7.) \n \n \nApplicant stated in his Answer that he had financial issues due to a death in his \nfamily that required travel for him and his family from his overseas work location back to \nthe United States. In addition, until she obtained American citizenship a short while ago, \nApplicant\u2019s wife was a lawful U.S. permanent resident. Accordingly, she had to return to \nUnited States territory for a period of time every year to retain her residency. Because of \nApplicant\u2019s work requirements, his child and stepchild had to go with her. In addition, \nApplicant stated that he did not properly prepare for life after he left the Army in 2013, \nand found himself in financial difficulties. (Item 5 at 4-5.) \n \n \nThe current status of the debts is as follows: \n \n \n1.a. Applicant admitted owing $13,171 to a credit union on a charged-off debt. \nThis debt has been delinquent since approximately 2013. Applicant stated in Applicant \nExhibit A that he has made a payment arrangement with the credit union to pay this \ndebt, and the one in allegation 1.c. He submitted bank records that appear to indicate \nhe has been making small payments on this debt since approximately May 2019. \nHowever, he provided no information as to how much of the debt has been paid, or how \nlong his payment plan will last. This debt is not resolved. (Item 7; Applicant Exhibit A at \n1, 8-10.) \n \n \n1.b. Applicant admitted owing $10,019 to a bank on a charged-off debt. This debt \nhas been delinquent since approximately 2015. Applicant stated in his Answer that he \nhad problems getting payments he made to a collection agency properly credited to this \naccount. He further stated that he was attempting to contact the new collection agency \nto arrange payment. No further information was submitted. This debt is not resolved. \n(Item 7.) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n1.c. Applicant admitted owing $7,954 to a credit union on a charged-off debt. This \ndebt has been delinquent since approximately 2015. Applicant stated in Applicant \nExhibit A that he has made a payment arrangement with the credit union to pay this \ndebt, and the one in allegation 1.a. He submitted bank records that appear to indicate \nhe has been making small payments on this debt since approximately May 2019. \nHowever, he provided no information as to how much of the debt has been paid, or how \nlong his payment plan will last. This debt is not resolved. (Item 7; Applicant Exhibit A at \n1, 8-10.) \n \n \n1.d. Applicant admitted owing $693 to the US Government for an educational \nstipend that requires repayment. This debt has been delinquent since approximately \n2015. He submitted documentation indicating that he had made a payment arrangement \nwith this creditor to pay $100 a month towards this debt, and the one in allegation 1.e. \nHe also supplied bank records showing payments of $100 for May, June, and July \n2019. This debt is being resolved. (Item 7; Applicant Exhibit A at 1-6-10.) \n \n \n1.e. Applicant admitted owing $120 to the US Government for another \neducational stipend that requires repayment. This debt has been delinquent since \napproximately 2016. He submitted documentation indicating that he had made a \npayment arrangement with this creditor to pay $100 a month towards this debt, and the \none in allegation 1.d. He also supplied bank records showing payments of $100 for \nMay, June, and July 2019. This debt is being resolved. (Item 7; Applicant Exhibit A at 1-\n6-10.) \n \nParagraph 2 \u2013 Guideline B (Foreign Influence)  \n \n \nThe Government alleged in Paragraph 2 of the SOR that Applicant is ineligible \nfor clearance because he has foreign contacts or interests that may result in divided \nallegiance.  \n \n \nApplicant is a native-born American citizen. He and his wife have been together \nsince 2007, were married in 2012, and have one child together. This child is also an \nAmerican citizen. As stated, Applicant\u2019s wife is now an American citizen, as shown by \nher passport. (Applicant Exhibit A at 1.)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a citizen of the Philippines. She currently lives with \nApplicant and his wife, helping take care of their child. Applicant\u2019s step-child, an adult, is \nan American citizen and currently serving in the US military. His mother-in-law speaks \nlittle English, and Applicant\u2019s discussions with her are necessarily brief. He stated in his \nAnswer, \u201cAs for my father-in-law and siblings-in-law, I have almost never had any \npersonal communications with any of my wife\u2019s family that are residents of the \nPhilippines.\u201d Applicant goes on to state that his wife\u2019s relatives live in Manila, and have \nnever left the island of Luzon. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nThe Philippines \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts. The Philippines is a multi-party \nconstitutional republic. There are terroristic threats in several parts of the Philippines, \nprimarily limited to the southern islands of the country, and not including Luzon. In \naddition, there are allegations of human rights abuses by members of the security \nforces. \n \n The State Department\u2019s \u201cU.S. Relations With the Philippines: Bilateral Relations \nFact Sheet\u201d states:  \n \nU.S.-Philippine relations are based on strong historical and cultural \nlinkages and a shared commitment to democracy and human rights. The \n1951 U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty provides a strong foundation \nfor our robust security partnership, which began during World War II. \nStrong people-to-people ties and economic cooperation provide additional \navenues to engage on a range of bilateral, regional, and global issues. \nThe U.S.-Philippine Bilateral Strategic Dialogue is the annual forum for \nforward planning across the spectrum of our relationship. There are more \nthan four million U.S. citizens of Philippine ancestry in the United States, \nand more than 350,000 U.S. citizens in the Philippines, including a large \nnumber of United States veterans. An estimated 650,000 U.S. citizens \nvisit the Philippines each year. . . . Manila is home to the only Veterans \nAdministration regional office outside the United States. (United States \nDepartment of State, U.S. Relations With the Philippines: Bilateral \nRelations \nFact \nSheet, \nhttps://www.state.gov/u-s-relations-with-the-\nphilippines/ (last updated January 21, 2020).) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility and a \nsecurity clearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to \nbe used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks national security eligibility enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship transcends \nnormal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government reposes a \nhigh degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may \nbe disqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant, based on the evidence, had five delinquent accounts that he could not \nor chose not to resolve. These debts have been in existence for a considerable period \nof time. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions. \n \n \nThe guideline includes five conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nThe evidence does not establish that any of the above mitigating conditions apply \nto Applicant\u2019s financial situation, except in regard to allegations 1.d and 1.e, which are \nfound for him due to his making substantial payments in relation to the amounts of the \ndebts. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to these debts only. \n \nTurning to the rest of the debts: AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because the debts \ncontinue to be due and owing. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply in full force. Applicant did \nhave financial issues due to his wife having to travel to United States territory every year \n\n \n8 \n \nfor several years, and his other family circumstances. However, Applicant did not supply \nsufficient information for me to conclude that he had \u201cacted responsibly under the \ncircumstances.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and (d) also do not apply. Applicant did not provide proof \nof payment to the creditor in 1.b, and the payments to the creditor in allegations 1.a and \n1.c. are minimal. Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns created by his \nfinancial situation. Paragraph 1 is found against Applicant. \n \nParagraph 2 - Guideline B (Foreign Influence) \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s wife is now an American citizen. However, her parents are both \nPhilippine citizens, as are her siblings. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law lives with Applicant. \nThe others live in the Philippines. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying \nconditions.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \nThe Philippines has significant internal terrorism threats that operate contrary to \nU.S. interests. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s family connections in that country have the \npotential to generate a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion under AG \u00b6 7(a). The mere possession of close \nfamily ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying \nunder Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an \napplicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the \npotential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified \ninformation. (See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case \nNo. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).) \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nApplicant is a proud American citizen and Army veteran. His wife is an American \ncitizen, and his contact with her family members outside of his mother-in-law is minimal.  \nGiven the nature of his family connections to the Philippines, there is little to no \npossibility of Applicant being subject to influence or pressure. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), (b), and (c) \napply. \n \nI have carefully considered the fact that Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s family lives in the \nPhilippines. In this particular case, I find that Applicant has mitigated the security \nsignificance arising from their presence for the following reasons. The Philippines is a \nlong-time ally of the United States, with a large American veteran population. In \naddition, Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s family lives on Luzon, far away from the south of the country, \nwhich is the main base for terrorist activities. Applicant has completely mitigated the \nsecurity significance of the presence of his wife\u2019s relations in the Philippines. Paragraph \n2 is found for Applicant. \n \n\n \n10 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant is a patriotic American citizen, Army veteran, and member of the \ndefense industry. He can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nUnited States due to his overwhelming sense of loyalty to the United States; and has \nminimized the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress under the Foreign \nInfluence guideline. \n \nHowever, he has not mitigated the concerns raised by his financial issues. He \nhas begun resolving several of his debts, but the payments are minimal and the \nevidence sparse about his ability to maintain such payments into the future. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for \nnational security eligibility and a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d through 1.e:  \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

He answered the \nSOR (Answer) in writing on June 6, 2019, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) received the \nrequest on July 22, 2019. I received the case assignment on July 22, 2019. DOHA \nissued a Notice of Hearing on August 2, 2019, and I convened the hearing as \nrescheduled on September 17, 2019. The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through \n3, which were received into evidence over objection. (Transcript (TR) at page 14 line 4 \n\n \n2 \n \n \nto page 16 line 15.) Applicant testified and resubmitted Exhibits (AppXs) A through D, \nwhich were already appended to Applicant\u2019s Answer, and admitted into evidence \nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on September 26, \n2019. Based upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR Applicant admitted the factual allegation in \nSubparagraph 1.a., but denied Subparagraph 1.b. of the SOR, with explanations. He \nalso provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security \nclearance. \n \n \nApplicant is 33 years old, is \u201csingle,\u201d works for a defense contractor, and has held \na security clearance \u201csince 2009.\u201d (TR at page 18 line 17 to page 20 line 17.)  \n \nGuideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement \n \n \n \n1.a. Applicant admits he used marijuana in about July of 2017, after having been \ngranted a security clearance. (TR at page 33 line 16 to page 34 line 1, and GX 2 at \npage 6.) This usage was not intentional. (TR at page 22 line 22 to page 32 line 17.) At \nthe time of the incident, Applicant was a heavy cigarette smoker. He had run out of \ncigarettes, and took one puff from a co-workers \u201cvape pen,\u201d not knowing it contained \nmarijuana. Applicant only discovered that the vape pen contained marijuana when \u201ca \nfew minutes\u201d later he \u201cfelt light-headed.\u201d Only then did the owner of the pen disclose its \ncontents. (Id.)  Applicant self-reported this unintentional usage. (TR at page 39 lines \n20~23, and at page 40 line 21 to page 41 line 18.) Applicant\u2019s credibility in this regard is \nattested to by former and present colleagues at work. (AppX D.) Furthermore, he has \nprovided a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse in the future. (TR at page 20 line 18 to page 21 line 4, and AppX D.) \nThis allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.b. Although Applicant does not remember the alleged usage more than 18 \nyears ago, I find that he used marijuana twice in August of 2001, as disclosed in his \nFebruary 2007 e-QIP. (TR at page 21 line 5 to page 22 line 21, at page 36 line 20, and \nGX 3 at page 23.) This allegation is also found for Applicant. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \n\n \n4 \n \n \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions are established: \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n \n \nAppellant smoked marijuana on three occasions. On the most recent occasion, \nAppellant had a security clearance for his job at that time. Therefore, AG \u00b6 25 (a), (c), \nand (f) are established.  \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \n\n \n5 \n \n \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \n \n \nThe Applicant used marijuana twice over 18 years ago, and once over two years \nago under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur. He has also provided \na signed statement of intent eschewing future involvement or misuse. The Drug \nInvolvement and Substance Misuse guideline is found for Applicant. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 2(b) requires each case must be judged on its own merits.  Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is very well respected in \nthe workplace. (AppXs C and D.) \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his drug involvement \nand substance abuse.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.: \n \nFor Applicant  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nRichard A.

Between July 2013 and September 2018, he incurred \nadditional delinquent debt. In April 2019, he filed another Chapter 13 petition which is \npending. The extenuating circumstances for his problems have been evaluated. \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation lacks essential documentary support that \nhe claimed he would but did not produce, to show he has his financial issues under \ncontrol. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied.   \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn August 24, 2017, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain a security clearance required for a position \nwith a defense contractor. On December 20, 2017, he provided a personal subject \ninterview (PSI) to an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). On \nDecember 21, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by phone. Three additional PSIs were \nconducted in April, August, and September 2018. After reviewing the results of a \n\n \n  2 \n \nsecurity background investigation, the Department of Defense (DOD) could not make \nthe affirmative findings required to grant a security clearance, and issued to Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR), dated May 8, 2019, detailing security concerns under \nfinancial considerations (Guideline F). The action was taken under Executive Order \n(E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective in the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant provided his notarized answer on July 15, 2019, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on October 23, 2019, for a hearing on November 20, \n2019. The hearing was held as scheduled. The Government\u2019s six exhibits (GE) 1-6 and \nApplicant\u2019s two exhibits (AE) A-B were entered into evidence without objection. On \nDecember 5, 2019, Applicant submitted six additional exhibits (AE C-H) that have been \nadmitted into evidence without objection. On December 4, 2019, DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.). The record in this case closed on December 5, 2019.  \n \nRulings on Procedure \n \nAt the beginning of the hearing, I asked Applicant whether he objected to the \nPSIs (GE 2). I advised him that the exhibit would not be admitted into evidence over his \nobjection. I then advised him that he could call a recess and review the exhibit for \ninaccuracies, then testify about modifications that he wished to make to improve the \ntruthfulness and clarity of the exhibit. Applicant chose to make one modification. (Tr. 45) \nGE 2 was admitted into evidence. \n \nPage numbers of the Government\u2019s exhibits, except for GE 1, are handwritten \nand appear in the lower right hand corner of the exhibit. Applicant\u2019s exhibits are similarly \nmarked in the lower right hand corner of the exhibit.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant owes 11 delinquent debts (SOR 1.a-1.k) that \nbecame delinquent between July 2013 and September 2018. The total amount of debt \nis $22,448. In 2005, he filed a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy petition that was dismissed in \n2009 (SOR 1.l) after conversion to a Chapter 7. In April 2019, he filed a second Chapter \n13 petition that is pending (SOR 1.m). Applicant admitted all allegations with \nexplanations. All of the listed debts, except for SOR 1.c, 1.d, 1.g, and 1.k were included \nin the April 2019 Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition (SOR 1.m). \n \n \nApplicant is 55 years old. He was married for almost 11 years before divorcing in \n2003. He has a 24-year-old daughter from this marriage. He and his partner have been \ntogether since 2006. In 2004, Applicant obtained an associate\u2019s degree in electronic \nengineering, and in June 2019, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in information \n\n \n  3 \n \ntechnology (IT), with a focus in cybersecurity. (GE 1 at 25-26, 29, 31, 45; Tr. 37; GE 2 at \n3) \n \n \nApplicant served on active duty in the U.S. Army (USA) from 1986 to 1994, when \nhe was honorably discharged. He served in the Army Reserve from 1994 to 2009. \n \n \nThough Applicant certified in his August 2017 e-QIP that he had never been \ninvestigated or held a security clearance, he informed the OPM investigator in \nDecember 2017 that he held a security clearance in the Army and when he worked for a \ncontractor in 2011. Except for one three-month period between May and August 2010, \nApplicant has been steadily employed, earning at least $85,000 a year, since his \ndischarge from the Army Reserve in 2009. (GE 1 at 25-26, 29, 31, 41, 45; Tr. 37; GE 2 \nat 2-3) \n \n \nApplicant filed his first Chapter 13 Bankruptcy petition in July 2005 (SOR 1.l) \nbecause \u201cI got to a point where I had more going out than I had coming in.\u2026\u201d (Tr. 69) \nHe indicated that he filed the petition to save his house. His former wife had incurred a \nlarge amount of debt which he had to pay under the terms of his divorce decree in \nOctober 2003. The decree required him to pay $368 a month in child support. GE 5 at \n11, 23-26; Tr. 69-73) \n \n \nThe Chapter 13 petition was converted to a Chapter 7 in May 2009 after the \nmortgage company found an investor who purchased Applicant\u2019s house and several \nother houses in the area. He conceded that he had not been making payments regularly \nunder the Chapter 13 petition plan. The Chapter 7 petition was dismissed in October \n2009 because Applicant was not appearing at bankruptcy meetings after he moved out \nof the state. Though he claims he had no debt in 2009, the 2005 bankruptcy petition \nshows under Schedule F that, among several accounts listed, he owed two delinquent \naccounts totaling about $570, a judgment of $5,171, and a medical account amounting \nto $1,300. (GE 5 at 11, 23-26; Tr. 69-73) \n \n \nSOR 1.a \u2013 This mortgage account on Applicant\u2019s house in location B became \ndelinquent in April 2018. The amount of the delinquency is $2,847 on a balance of \n$192,159. He purchased the house in October 2014 and rented it in 2017 while he was \nworking in location A. The mortgage account became delinquent because Applicant \ntook a $20,000 pay cut when he moved from employment location A to B in July 2018. \n(GE 6; Tr. 31-34, 46, 73, 86; July 2019 answer to SOR) \n \n \nAfter Applicant moved to his house in location B, he discovered the renters had \ncaused extensive damage which he repaired. He had to fumigate the house. Because \nwater had been left standing on the kitchen floor, he had to repair the floor. He had to \nrepaint the house and fix the yard. He withdrew $1,000 from his retirement account for \nthe repairs. After fixing the damage, he had no money to pay the mortgage account. \nApplicant filed a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy petition in April 2019 (SOR 1.m) to save his \nhouse in location B. The additional debts listed in the petition, which include most of the \n\n \n  4 \n \nSOR accounts, confirm that the SOR 1.a mortgage was not Applicant\u2019s only overdue \naccount in April 2019. The reason why Applicant moved was to relocate his disabled \nmother from location C to his house in location B. His mother decided to move instead \nwith one of Applicant\u2019s sisters. (GE 6; Tr. 31-35, 46, 73, 85-86; July 2019 answer to \nSOR)  \n \n \nRegarding Applicant\u2019s payments of the mortgage through the April 2019 Chapter \n13 petition, he claimed he could provide documentation showing: (1) that he was current \non his $800 monthly payments under the Chapter 13 payment plan (SOR 1.a); and (2) \nthat he would produce documentation from 2018 showing the four missed mortgage \npayments. Applicant\u2019s documentation does not show an $800 mortgage payment made \nin August 2019 and thereafter, or any previous petition-plan payments of $1,000 a \nmonth before then. There are two postings, each identified as \u201cbankruptcy payment,\u201d for \nAugust 2 and August 6, 2019, but no payment amount is entered next to either posting. \n(Tr. 46-50, 75; July 2019 answer to the SOR; AE A, C, G) \n \n \nThe lack of credible documentation of payments under the bankruptcy petition \npayment plan generates questions of how Applicant reworked his budget to bring the \nmortgage to a current status. In the email exchanges between Applicant and his \nbankruptcy attorney on August 18, 2019, the attorney noted that Applicant\u2019s plan \npayment was behind and commented that fewer less costly payment options were \navailable regarding payment plans for the mortgage. SOR 1.a was removed from the \nChapter 13 petition after Applicant received a home loan modification (HLN) on the \nmortgage. The HLM was signed, dated, and notarized by Applicant on August 1, 2019, \nbut contains no lender acknowledgement date by the mortgage company, or a signature \nfrom a notary. (Tr. 46-50, 75; July 2019 answer to the SOR; AE A, C, G; AE H at 5-6) \n \n \nSOR 1.b \u2013 This is an installment contract for a car that became delinquent in \nSeptember 2018. The past-due amount is $577 on a balance of $28,199. The account \nis listed in Applicant\u2019s April 2019 Chapter 13 Bankruptcy petition. (GE 6 at 14; Tr. 47, \n49-50) \n \n \nSOR 1.c \u2013 This is an installment contract for a car; the deficiency balance owed \nis $8,976. Applicant and his partner cosigned for the car in 2016. The account became \ndelinquent in May 2018. Eventually, the car was sold at auction, leaving a deficiency \nbalance. Applicant returned the car to the dealer in April 2018 after his partner lost his \njob in February 2018 and could not meet his portion of the monthly payments. (GE 3 at \n2; Tr. 51-54) \n \n \nApplicant tried to place the SOR 1.c deficiency balance in the April 2019 \nBankruptcy petition, but the trustee refused because of joint ownership status of the \naccount. Applicant\u2019s partner is now working as a chef and is making all payments on the \ndeficiency balance. Applicant indicated he could provide documentation to show his \npartner is making payments on SOR 1.c. No documentation was submitted. (Tr. 51-54, \n81-82) \n\n \n  5 \n \n \nSOR 1.d \u2013 This is an unsecured personal loan that Applicant opened in \nSeptember 2017, with a former female coworker as cosigner. The account, which totals \n$5,193, became delinquent in September 2018. The female coworker satisfied the \naccount in November 2018. Applicant took out the loan to pay his daughter\u2019s rent to \navoid her eviction, and to provide her with funds for a car payment. When the female \ncoworker could not make her portion of the monthly payments, Applicant became \ndelinquent on the full payment by two months. (GE 3 at 2; Tr. 56-57, 83; AE D) \n \n \nSOR 1.e \u2013 This is an account for cable equipment which is now in the April 2019 \nbankruptcy (SOR 1.m). The account, which is $1,603, became delinquent in August \n2014. Applicant claimed that he returned the equipment, but threw away the shipping \nreceipt. The Government credit report information shows that Applicant disputed the \naccount. (GE 1 at 49; GE 2 at 4; Tr. 58-60) \n \n \nSOR 1.f \u2013 This cable account that became delinquent in April 2017; the past-due \namount is $450. Applicant testified that the balance was actually $900, and when he \nvisited the cable company, an agent settled the account for $450. He testified that he \npaid the amount in June 2018, but the cable company does not have a record of the \n$450 payment. Applicant believes that his bankruptcy attorney just moved the account \ninto the Chapter 13 petition without investigating whether the account was valid. (GE 3 \nat 2; Tr. 60-63) \n \n \nSOR 1.g \u2013 This is a medical account ($71) that became delinquent in April 2017. \nApplicant\u2019s documentation shows that he paid the account in May 2019, about a week \nafter he received the SOR. He was not aware of the account until the OPM investigator \ninformed him in the December 2017 PSI. When asked why he waited about a year and \na half to pay the debt in May 2019, he explained that after receiving the SOR a short \ntime earlier in May 2019, he decided to pay the debt. He predicted that he would have \neventually paid the debt because it was so small. (Tr. 62-65) \n \n \nSOR 1.h \u2013 This phone account ($120) became delinquent in May 2014. Applicant \ntestified that he closed the account 30 days after he received the phone because he \nwas dissatisfied with the service. He told the OPM investigator in December 2017 that \nhe was overcharged for the phone, but planned to contact the collection agency and set \na payment plan. Documentation shows that Applicant disputed the account. The debt is \nnow in the April 2019 Chapter 13 petition. (GE 2 at 4; GE 4 at 3; Tr. 65-66) \n \n \nSOR 1.i \u2013 This is a cable account ($1,555) that became delinquent in August \n2017. Applicant agreed to assume primary liability for a cable account for his daughter. \nShe finally returned the cable equipment to the creditor. In December 2017, Applicant \nindicated to the OPM that he intended to contact the collection agency and make \npayments. Applicant testified that the account no longer appears on his credit report. He \nagreed to furnish a copy of his credit report to show the account was no longer posted. \nNo credit report was submitted. (GE 2 at 5; GE 4 at 15; Tr. 66-67) \n \n\n \n  6 \n \n \nSOR 1.j \u2013 This is a payday loan ($920) that became delinquent in August 2017. \nApplicant needed the funds to pay for his travel to and from his daughter\u2019s high school \ngraduation in May 2014. Applicant chose the payday loan because he could not obtain \nthe funds in any other way. Though Applicant believed the interest rate of the loan was \n160%, he could not remember why he could not maintain payments. Surprisingly, he \ninformed the OPM investigator in December 2017 that he was making $50 monthly \npayments on the debt. The account is included in Applicant\u2019s April 2019 Chapter 13 \npetition. (GE 2 at 4; GE 4 at 15; Tr. 67-68, 83) \n \n \nSOR 1.k \u2013 This is a dental account for Applicant\u2019s daughter. The bill ($136) \nbecame delinquent in July 2013. Even though he discussed the debt with the OPM \ninvestigator in December 2017, he did not pay the debt until after he received the SOR \nin May 2019, the same explanation he supplied for paying the SOR 1.g debt. (GE 4 at \n16; Tr. 68-69; AE B) \n \n \nThough he provided no documentation to support his claims, Applicant indicated \nthat he used credit counseling companies to fix his credit issues. He paid them every \nmonth, but saw no results because he was still receiving calls and letters from creditors. \nHe began contacting the collection agencies directly, but the creditors always wanted \nmore money than the parties had originally negotiated. (GE 1 at 46) \n \n \nIn 2017, he paid a credit repair firm $100 a month for up to six months to \ndiscourage collection agencies from contacting him. He noted that the firm had been \nmaking some early progress in removing some accounts from his credit report. \nHowever, he became dissatisfied again because he was still receiving phone calls and \nletters from collection agents. He testified that he pulled out of the credit-repair service \nafter paying a $100 a month for six months and seeing no improvement in his overall \nfinances. Applicant has never received financial counseling and has not obtained \nfinancial advice from anyone. (GE 1 at 46-47; GE 2 at 4; Tr. 74, 79-80) \n \n \nThough Applicant has had uninterrupted employment for the last ten years, he \nhas been able to save only $1,000, although he believes he could borrow some of the \n$4,000 that his partner has saved. The reasons for the paltry savings is: that Applicant \nhas had to occasionally subsidize his daughter\u2019s college living and transportation \nexpenses over the years; that he has paid most of his partner\u2019s bills whenever he could \nnot pay them; and that he had to spend a large amount of money in July 2018 to fix the \ndamage to his house in location B. (Tr. 78-79, 87)  \n \n \nIn his closing statement, Applicant conceded that he has made some poor \nfinancial choices, but takes responsibility for all his decisions. He indicated that he has \nestablished a budget to keep track of his finances. (AE F) He used the word \u201cbudget\u201d \nseveral times in his July 2019 answer to the SOR and in his closing statement, but did \nnot explain whether he has a written budget or a computer-generated budget. AE E is \nnot a budget, but a list of creditors with undated payment amounts posted next to each \ncreditor. (AE E) \n\n \n  7 \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare not inflexible rules of law, should be applied with common sense and the general \nfactors of the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. The protection of the national security is the \nparamount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel \nbeing considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe security concerns of the guideline for financial considerations are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n \nAn applicant who seeks a security clearance with the Government must \ndemonstrate that he has good judgment and is trustworthy. A gauge of his judgment \nand trustworthiness can be evaluated by how he goes about managing his personal \naffairs. An applicant who shows a history of financial irresponsibility in paying his \nvoluntarily incurred debts may also demonstrate irresponsibility in failing to comply with \nrules and regulations for safeguarding sensitive or classified information. \n\n \n  8 \n \nThe conditions under AG \u00b619 that raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nWhile Applicant claims he filed a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy petition in 2005 to save \nhis house, Schedule F of the petition shows that he also had other delinquent accounts \nand one judgment. In 2009, the petition was converted to a Chapter 7, then it was \ndismissed, not discharged, meaning that the Schedule F accounts identified as \ndelinquent in the original 2005 petition remained delinquent. Between July 2013 and \nSeptember 2018, Applicant incurred 11 additional delinquent debts totaling $22,448. In \nNovember 2018, a cosigner on a personal loan, made the final payment on the balance \nof the loan. In May 2019, Applicant satisfied SOR 1.g and 1.k, reducing the total \ndelinquent debt amount to $17,048. A Chapter 13 petition filed in 2005 and dismissed in \nOctober 2009, with a record of continued financial problems for ten additional years, \nshows a long history of not handling financial obligations in a responsible manner. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. I do not conclude that Applicant was unwilling to resolve his \nindebtedness based on the initial good judgment he used to file a Chapter 13 petition in \n2005 and in April 2019. Applicant\u2019s two main problems have been a lack of financial \ncounseling and not prioritizing his own financial responsibilities. AG \u00b6 19(b)  \n \nThe pertinent mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 include: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n\n \n  9 \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s 2005 Chapter 13 Bankruptcy petition was filed more than 14 years \nago. However, none of the accounts, including the delinquent accounts, were paid or \ndischarged since the original petition was converted to a Chapter 7, then dismissed in \n2009. Applicant\u2019s accumulation of 11 additional delinquent accounts between 2013 and \nSeptember 2018, and his inability to address most of the debts until April 2019 (SOR \n1.m) when he filed the second Chapter 13 Bankruptcy petition, continues to raise \nsecurity concerns about his reliability and judgment. The lack of credible documentation \nrelated to Applicant\u2019s payments under the current Chapter 13 petition payment \nschedule, weighed against the circumstances of the dismissed Chapter 7 petition in \n2009, raise lingering concerns about whether Applicant will complete this current plan \nsuccessfully. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s daughter\u2019s occasional living and transportation expenses, his \npartner\u2019s expenses over the years, and the renters\u2019 damage to house before he \nreturned to location B in July 2018 were unforeseen events beyond Applicant\u2019s control \nthat resulted in financial problems. The first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies.   \n \n \nThe second prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) requires responsible action to be taken under \nthe circumstances. From 2010 to the present, Applicant has been steadily employed \nand earning at least $85,000 a year. Nevertheless, he accumulated more delinquent \ndebt between 2013 and September 2018, and has taken no action to address most of \nthe debt until he filed the Chapter 13 petition in April 2019. After weighing the \nquestionable documentation submitted as evidence regarding Applicant\u2019s payments \nunder the current Chapter 13 plan, with the surrounding circumstances leading to the \ndismissed Chapter 7 petition in 2009, I conclude that the second prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) \nhas only minimal application.  \n \n \nApplicant explained that he had hired credit-counseling firms and credit-repair \nservices without success. He testified that he has never received financial counseling or \nfinancial advice. Though he has a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy petition plan underway, he \nhas provided negligible evidence that he is making regular payments under the plan. \nBased on the absence of financial counseling, I am unable to confidently conclude his \ndebts are under control or being resolved. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply.  \n \n \nShortly after he received the SOR in May 2019, Applicant satisfied the SOR 1.g \nand 1.k debts. Although Applicant receives some credit for satisfying these two debts, \nthe payoffs were not made in good faith, but after he received the SOR. He was not \nsimply paying off his debts to show financial responsibility, but to enhance his chances \nof receiving a security clearance. AG \u00b6 20(d) has limited application to Applicant\u2019s \npayoff of SOR 1.g and 1.k debts. \n\n \n  10 \n \n \nThe Government credit reports show that Applicant disputed SOR 1.e and 1.h. \nHe provided a reasonable basis for the disputes but provided no documentation to \nsupport the disputes. He claimed that SOR 1.i no longer appeared on his credit report. \nWhile he testified he would supply a credit report to prove his claim, no report was \nprovided. In addition, all three debts are in his Chapter 13 Bankruptcy petition. AE \u00b6 \n20(e) does not apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI have examined the evidence under the specific guideline (financial \nconsiderations) in the context of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \n \nApplicant is 55 years old. He has a 24-year-old daughter his former wife from his \nprevious marriage. He has been in a relationship with his partner since 2006. His first \nChapter 13 Bankruptcy petition in 2005 was ultimately dismissed in 2009 after it had \nbeen converted to a Chapter 7. Between 2013 and September 2018, he continued to \naccumulate additional delinquent debts listed in the SOR.  \n \n \nApplicant has a long history of financial problems, He has been given ample \nnotice by the Government that his debts raised security concerns. He had sufficient time \nto seek help concerning his debt delinquencies through some kind of financial \ncounseling. The purpose of counseling is teach an applicant how to control his earnings \nand expenses. Toward that end, financial counseling encourages one to live within his \nmeans so that he can regularly save money and ensure that he pays his own financial \nobligations before he pays the obligations of others. Considering the evidence as a \nwhole, Applicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation is insufficient to overcome the adverse \nevidence under the financial considerations guideline.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n  11 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.l, 1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d, 1.g, 1.k: \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied.  \n \n \n_________________ \nPaul J. Mason \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nApplicant did not mitigate financial concerns. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation or to hold a sensitive position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 2, 2019, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated Central \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nreasons why under the financial considerations guideline the DoD could not make the \npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960); Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram, DoD Directive 5220.6 (January 2, 1992) (Directive); and Security Executive \nAgent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \nApplicant responded to the SOR on February 25, 2020, and requested a hearing. \nThe case was assigned to me on June 26, 2020. A hearing was scheduled for August \n17, 2020, and heard on the scheduled date. At the hearing, the Government\u2019s case \nconsisted of eight exhibits (GEs 1-8) (Tr. 29-44). Applicant relied on 14 exhibits (A-N) \nand one witness (himself). The transcript (Tr.) was received on August 28, 2020. \n  Procedural Issues \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBefore the opening of the hearing, Applicant made a motion in limine to exclude \nreferences to Applicant\u2019s March 2012 termination covered in the summary interview of \nApplicant by an agent of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). (GE 2) Applicant \nnever waived his right to have the OPM summary of interview excluded from evidentiary \nconsideration. For good cause shown, Applicant\u2019s motion was granted in part, and the \nreferenced paragraph covering his prior employment termination was stricken from the \nmarked GE 2 exhibit. (Tr. 33) Applicant accepted the balance of the OPM summary of \ninterview for full evidentiary consideration. Denied was his included motion in limine to \nexclude his similar explanation of his 2012 employment termination in the electronic \nquestionnaires for electronic processing (e-QIP) he completed in July 2017. (GE 1) \nPrior to the close of the proceedings, Applicant asked to leave the record open to \nafford him the opportunity to supplement the record with information documenting the \nprincipal amount owing on his student loans. For good cause shown, Applicant was \ngranted 14 days to supplement the record. The Government was afforded three days to \nsupplement the record. Within the time permitted, Applicant provided several pieces of \ndocumentation covering the amounts still owing on the student loans referenced in the \nSOR: (a) a payment summary (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b) of Applicant\u2019s U.S.-guaranteed and \nsince consolidated student loan accounts covering his daughter\u2019s education loans (AE \nP); (b) payment summaries of a non-SOR student loan account of his daughter (AEs O \nand Q) covered by SOR \u00b6 1.d); and an email explanation of the submitted student loan \npayment summaries by Applicant\u2019s counsel (AE R). Applicant\u2019s post-hearing \nsubmissions were admitted as AEs O-R without objections for consideration. Comments \nof counsel for both parties on the exhibits will also be considered. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly accumulated three delinquent student \nloan debts exceeding $127,000 accumulated and two consumer debts exceeding $630. \nAllegedly, Applicant\u2019s debts remain unsatisfied and unresolved. \nUnder amended Guideline E, Applicant allegedly was terminated from his \nemployment with a prior defense contractor in March 2012 after being granted a \nsecurity clearance. Allegedly, his termination was based on his being caught taking a \npicture of a sensitive Army base site with a personal camera. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant denied each of the allegations covering his \ndebts and termination from his prior employment with explanations. He claimed he has \nbeen paying on his student loan accounts, which represent parent loans for his \n2 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndaughter, in the amount of $302.54 monthly, which since 2014 have been involuntarily \ndeducted from his earned Social Security (SS) benefits and tax refunds. Addressing his \nalleged consumer debts, Applicant claimed he could not identify either reported debt \nand claimed the credit report listing these debts was inaccurate \nIn his response to the personal conduct allegations covered in the Government\u2019s \nGuideline E amendment, Applicant denied the allegations in full. He interposed no \nobjection to the amendment and provided no explanations for his denial pertaining to his \nalleged termination by his employer for cause. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 73-year-old call center operator for a defense contractor who seeks \na security clearance. Applicant denied each of the allegations in the SOR, and findings \nof fact follow. \nBackground \nApplicant married in November 1968 and divorced in December 1982. (GE 1) He \nhas one adult child from this marriage. He remarried in January 1983 and divorced in \nNovember 2013. He has one adult child from this marriage. Applicant earned \ncommunity college education credits between September 1971 and June 1973, but did \nnot receive a degree or diploma. (GE 1) He enlisted in the U.S. Army in October 1966 \nand served two years of active duty. During his active tour of duty, Applicant earned a \nbronze star and purple heart in recognition of his contribution to his military service. (AE \nA) \nSince August 2016, Applicant has been employed by his current employer. (GE \n1) He reported periods of unemployment between August 2015 and March 2016, \nbetween July 2013 and September 2013, and between February 2011 and March 2011. \nIn March 2012, Applicant was terminated from his then employer as a switch operator \non an Army Base. Cited cause for his termination was his being caught taking pictures \nof a dial central office with a personal camera after being granted a security clearance in \nJune 2011. (GEs 1 and 6) \nApplicant\u2019s finances \nBetween November 2008 and May 2019, Applicant accumulated three  \ndelinquent student loan debts he guaranteed as a parent for his daughter\u2019s college \neducation. These two loans covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b61.a-1.b and 1.d involve three separate \naccounts with the same Navient/U.S. Government loan guarantee creditor: one for \n$42,802; another for $36,313; and a third for $39,108. (GEs 2-5) For two years (2012-\n2013) after the loans became due, Applicant\u2019s wife made voluntary payments on the \nloans on behalf of their working daughter. (Tr. 124) She ceased making these voluntary \npayments, however, after 2013, and Applicant could not say whether his daughter ever \nmade any payments once she began working. (Tr. 124) Acknowledging that each of the \nthree loans went into default after 2013, he could not confirm whether any of the loans \n3 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwere ever placed in forbearance before or after the defaults. (Tr. 123) Credit reports do \nnot reflect any prior forbearances granted to Applicant on any or all of the three student \nloans covered in the SOR. (GEs 3-5) \nIn his hearing testimony, Applicant expressed certainty that his three parent-\nguaranteed student loans were consolidated into one loan. (Tr. 122) He provided no \ndocumentation of consolidation of any or all of the three loans, however, and only the \ntwo loans covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b61.a-1.b are treated by the U.S. Department of Education \n(DoE) and the Department of the Treasury (DoT) as consolidated into one account for \ncollection purposes. (GEs A-N and P) Without corroborated evidence of consolidation of \nthe student loan covered by SOR \u00b61.d with the loans covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b, the \nSOR 1.d loan must be considered a separate delinquent loan that was apparently not \nincluded in any DoT garnishment initiatives covering the SOR 1.a-1.b loans. And, from \nthe evidence produced, none of the three delinquent student loans covered by the SOR \nhave been voluntarily addressed by Applicant or his wife and daughter since 2013. \nBeginning in March 2018, and ending in February 2020, the DoT placed the \nsince consolidated two parent-guaranteed loans (totaling $78,115) in collection status \nand began intercepting Applicant\u2019s SS benefits and involuntarily applied over $300 a \nmonth of Applicant\u2019s earmarked SS benefits to his delinquent student loan debts (AEs \nB-N P-R)  SS payments intercepted by DoT were involuntarily withheld and rechanneled \nfor payment of Applicant\u2019s consolidated student loan debts. (Tr. 54) The DoT\u2019s \nintercepted dollar amounts from Applicant\u2019s monthly $2,200 SS benefits ranged from \n$336 to $311, to $315, to $338 a month and reduced. (AEs B-L; Tr. 53-54) Altogether, \nDoT intercepted monthly amounts in excess of $3,300 from Applicant\u2019s SS benefits \nbetween May 2018 and February 2020. (AEs B-L) \nAfter February 2020, the DoT ceased intercepting portions of Applicant\u2019s SS \nbenefits, likely attributable to the Covid-19 pandemic. (Tr. 28) Absent any voluntary \npayments on the student loan debts from Applicant (none reported), the DoT can be \nexpected to resume its intercepting of Applicant\u2019s SS benefits once the Covid 19 \npandemic fades or is otherwise favorably resolved. \nBecause the DoT\u2019s intercepted funds from Applicant\u2019s SS benefits were applied \nexclusively to interest and fees owing on the student loan debts, Applicant was not \ncredited with any principal reductions from the SS benefits intercepted by the DoT. (AEs \nN and P) Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions confirm only that the DoT\u2019s intercepted \nSS funds were applied exclusively to accrued interest and fees and did not touch loan \nprinciple. (AE P) \nAdditional delinquent debts attributable to Applicant in the SOR are two small \ndelinquent medical debts totaling $633. (GEs 2-5) These debts are listed in Applicant\u2019s \ncredit reports without any information by which to identify the creditors by name. Asked \nabout these debts listed as delinquent in Applicant\u2019s credit reports, Applicant could not \nidentify them as debts belonging to him. (GE 2; Tr. 40-41) The listed medical debts are \nsmall and cannot be further corroborated. \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCurrently, Applicant has an annual salary of $40,000. (Tr. 52) He has earned \nannual social security benefits of $25,000 and two pensions from prior employers that \npay him $441 and $350 a month, respectively, for a combined annual return of $9,480. \n(Tr. 93-94) He maintains an average monthly checking balance of $1,600 and an \naverage monthly savings balance in the $600 range. (Tr. 94). His monthly debt liabilities \ninclude a $279,000 mortgage on a home valued at $420,000. (Tr. 95) Based on his \nmonthly income and identified debts, his current financial condition should enable him to \nmake payments on his daughter\u2019s delinquent student loans for which he bears \nrepayment responsibility. Since 2013, though, he has made no voluntary payments on \nthe loans that are in any way documented. \nApplicant\u2019s 2012 separation \n           According to JPAS incident reports from the Army Base in which he was \nassigned in March 2012, Applicant was discovered by base police taking pictures with \nhis personal camera phone of a base-dial central office directly outside of the Base \ncommunications office at the Army Base where he was assigned. (GE 6) He \nacknowledged his awareness that having any camera on Base property is strictly \nforbidden.

Applicant admitted only to taking a picture of a tree with his personal \ncamera for curiosity reasons and denied taking a picture of the dial central office or any \ncommunications center on the Base as charged. (Tr. 101-102) In his July 2017 e-QIP, \nhe attributed his ensuing 2012 employment termination to a report of the contracting \ncustomer of the Base (based on purported accounts from two unidentified Base security \nofficers and his own supervisor on site at the time of the reported incident) to the \ncontracting customer of the Base being uncomfortable with Applicant\u2019s reporting the \nmatter to his supervisor. (GE 1; Tr. 105-109 11) \nTwo weeks after the reported Base camera incident, Applicant was fired for \ncause by his own supervisor. (GE 1; Tr. 107-109) It is Applicant\u2019s stated belief that his \nensuing firing was prompted by the contracting customer\u2019s perceived retaliation to \nApplicant\u2019s reporting his observations of the customer\u2019s heated encounter with his wife \n(armed with a gun in his possession), to his supervisor. (Tr. 107-109) Corroboration of \nApplicant\u2019s claimed observations is lacking in the record. \nWith conflicting versions of what Applicant was targeting with his camera in the \nMarch 2012 incident, little evidence in place to corroborate either version of the camera \nincident, and the lengthy time lapse (over eight years) in which to locate witnesses with \nclear recollections of the camera incident, inferences of what Applicant was targeting \nwith his personal camera in the reported March 2012 Base incident cannot be \nreasonably and reliably drawn without considerable reaching and speculation. All that is \nclear and accepted is that Applicant took a picture with his personal camera of some \nobject on the Base in March 2012 that he knew at the time was forbidden by Base \nregulations and guidelines. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSince his March 2012 Base camera incident, Applicant has not had any reported \nadverse incidents involving security violations.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \n6 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern:  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated  by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds.  .  .  .

Additional security concerns are \nraised over his March 2012 termination attributable to his reported violating Base \nregulations and guidelines banning the taking of pictures of Base property by taking a \npicture of a Base facility with his personal camera. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFinancial concerns  \nApplicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent debts (both student loans and consumer \naccounts) warrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the \nfinancial consideration guidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d: and 19(c), \u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Each of these DCs apply to Applicant\u2019s \nsituation. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admitted debt delinquencies negate the need for any independent \nproof. See Directive 5220.6 at E3. 1.1.14; McCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 262 (6th  ed. 2006) \nHis admitted debts and tax filing lapses are fully documented and create some \njudgment issues. See ISCR Case No. 03-01059 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004).  \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment, and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving debt \ndelinquencies and tax return filing lapses. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). Applicant\u2019s \nhistory of financial difficulties associated with his long-delinquent parent-guaranteed \nstudent loans for his daughter over a period of years that he has failed to resolve (either \nvoluntarily, or even involuntarily through intercepted earmarked SS benefits) preclude \nhis taking advantage of any of the potentially available extenuating benefits. \nBecause Applicant has failed to provide any documented evidence of initiated \nefforts to resolve his admitted student loan debts, mitigating credit cannot be extended \nunder any of the potentially available mitigating conditions. More time is required for \nApplicant to demonstrate that he is taking responsible steps to address and resolve his \ndelinquent student loan debts. \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of accrued debts. ISCR case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd.

These \nmedical debts are small and disputed by Applicant. Considering all of the \ncircumstances, Applicant\u2019s explanations are reasonable and enable him to take partial  \nadvantage of MC \u00b6 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue.\u201d While these debts are not fully explained with documented \naccounts of any earlier actions taken to resolve them, the listed debts are not sufficiently \nexplained in the credit reports to enable Applicant to reasonably identify and resolve \nthem with information available to him.   \n \n \nPersonal conduct concerns \n \nSecurity concerns are raised as well over Applicant\u2019s termination from his \nemployment with a previous defense contractor in March 2012 (after being granted a \nsecurity clearance and access to classified information in June 2011) after he was \nreportedly observed by two Base security officers taking a picture with his personal \ncamera of a Base dial central office in violation of Base regulations and guidelines. \nApplicant acknowledged his awareness of the Base prohibitions against taking pictures \non Base of Base facilities, his taking a picture with his personal camera while on Base, \nand his ensuing termination by his own supervisor. He disputed, however, his taking a \npicture of the Base\u2019s dial central office and claimed the picture he took in March 2012 \nwas of a nearby tree.   \n9 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n       \nCorroborative evidence of the tree incident reported to JPAS in March 2012 is \nlacking in the record, and there are plausible motivational reasons for the Base facility \nmanager\u2019s making the allegations reported in JPAS based on Applicant\u2019s account of \nwhat he previously encountered with the facility manager on the Base. Moreover, this is \nan isolated and aged incident (over eight years ago) in Applicant\u2019s employment history \nand does not represent any pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \nSo, while Applicant\u2019s knowing use of a personal camera to take a picture of Base \nproperty (whether a building structure or a tree that was possibly in the line of sight of \nthe camera) while on the Base, in violation of Base regulations and guidelines, the \nincident itself is isolated and does not reflect any pattern dishonesty or rule violations by \nApplicant. Considering all of the circumstances surrounding the reported March 12 \nincident, the conduct is mitigated. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his finances are fully compatible with minimum standards for \nholding a clearance. While Applicant is entitled to credit for his civilian contributions to \nthe defense industry, his efforts are not enough at this time to overcome his failures to \nresolve his accumulated student loan debt delinquencies. His past and present failures \nto address and resolve his accumulated student debt delinquencies reflect adversely on \nhis ability to maintain his finances in a sufficiently stable manner to meet the minimum \nrequirements for holding a security clearance. At this time, it is too soon to make safe \npredictions that Applicant will be able to voluntarily, or even involuntarily, resolve his \naccrued student debts within the foreseeable future. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied.   \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  Against Applicant \n                       For Applicant \n                 \n                   Guideline E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):  \n \n  \n \n \n                    \n \nGuideline F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):  AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b and 1.d:  \nSubparagraphs 1.c and 1.e:    \n             FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n10 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Myers, Esq. \nMarch 2, 2020 \nDecision \nGLENDON, John Bayard, Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines D (sexual conduct) \nand J (criminal conduct). For about ten years prior to October 2016, Applicant solicited \nsexual services with prostitutes and otherwise paid for sexual activities with women while \nliving and working in a foreign country. He ceased this behavior in September 2016 and \ndisclosed his misconduct to his spouse, family members, manager, security officer, and \na U.S. Government investigator. Applicant provided significant evidence in mitigation. \nNational security eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 21, 2016, Applicant filed a security clearance application (SCA). The \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on April 23, 2019, setting forth allegations under Guidelines \nD and J. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960) as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended \n\n2 \n \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (Dec. 10, 2016), effective for all \nadjudicative decisions on or after June 8, 2017. \n \nOn May 29, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR. He requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). On \nNovember 26, 2019, the case was assigned to me. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on \nDecember 4, 2019, scheduling the hearing on January 9, 2020.  \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel presented two \nproposed exhibits. I marked her exhibits as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 and I \nmarked her exhibit list as Hearing Exhibit 1. Applicant attached four documents to his \nSOR answer. I marked these documents as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through D. At the \nhearing, his attorney offered six additional proposed exhibits, which he marked as AE E \nthough J.  \n \nAbsent any objections, I admitted all exhibits into the record. Applicant testified on \nhis own behalf. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on January 21, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his SCA unless otherwise \nindicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings, Applicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing, and the documentary evidence in the \nrecord, I make the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant, 40, has worked as an IT professional since 2007. He has held a security \nclearance since about 2011. Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree at a U.S. university in \n2002, and a master\u2019s degree in 2005 from a university in a foreign country. He has lived \nand worked in that country since he began his graduate studies in 2003. In 2012, he \nmarried a woman who was born and raised in that country. Applicant and his wife currently \nlive in that country. She has not become a U.S. citizen or a U.S. registered alien. They \nhave a four-year-old child. Applicant chose to attend the hearing in person and traveled \nto the United States for that purpose. (AE G; Tr. 13.) \n \nGuideline D (sexual conduct)  \n \n \nIn his October 5, 2016 background interview, Applicant fully disclosed derogatory \ninformation about his compulsive or impulsive sexual activities since 2005. These \nactivities included paying for the services of prostitutes. On those occasions, he identified \nthrough online searches establishments called \u201csoap lands.\u201d He would pay the proprietor \nof the business and be introduced to a woman who bathed him and engaged in sexual \nactivities with him. He did this about ten times over a period of about ten years. (GE 2 at \n7; Tr. 18-20, 25, 31-32, 34-36, 38-39.) \n \n\n3 \n \n \nOn other occasions, Applicant engaged in sexual activities at \u201corgy parties\u201d and at \nmassage parlors. The orgy parties were organized by a paid \u201ccoordinator\u201d and were \nattended by men and women. Applicant is uncertain whether the women were paid sex \nworkers or voluntary participants. He also paid for sexual services at massage parlors. \nHe engaged in these sexual activities three or four times a year when he was younger \nand less often after his child was born in 2015. The last time he engaged in any extra-\nmarital sexual activity was in September 2016. (Tr. at 18-19, 28-30.) \n \n \nApplicant also went to \u201chostess bars\u201d where female hostesses served him drinks \nand flirted with him. He had no sexual contact with the hostesses. Sexual activities are \nnot part of the services offered at hostess bars. He met his wife at a hostess bar and \nstarted dating her in about 2009. His wife was unaware of his extra-marital sexual \nactivities until he disclosed them to her in September 2016 prior to his background \ninterview. She was upset to learn about his conduct, but has forgiven him. She provided \na letter that Applicant introduced into the record. She wrote that \u201che has deeply reflected \non his mistakes and I trust that there will be no occurrence in the future.\u201d She also wrote \nthat \u201cI can attest that he is earnest, a person with morals, and he is a trustworthy \nindividual.\u201d (AE F; Tr. at 26-27.) \n \n \nIn October 2016, Applicant also disclosed his past sexual activities to his parents, \nmanager, facility security officer, and as noted, to a U.S Government investigator. His \nvoluntary disclosure of his activities were important steps for him. He committed to himself \nto cease these activities and to become a better man, husband, and role model for his \nchild. He has ceased all of this extra-marital sexual behavior. In May 2019, he began \nseeking therapy for what he considers to be his impulsive desire for sexual pleasure. He \nwrote in his SOR answer that he wants to \u201creaffirm that these behaviors are in the past \nand will not recur.\u201d His therapy is ongoing. Applicant believes he needs the therapy and \nfinds it helpful. (SOR answer; AE B; AE E; GE 2; Tr. at 24, 31-33.) \n \nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) \n \n \nApplicant believes that his sexual activity described above is legal in his country of \nresidence where they occurred, but he is not certain. His lawyer clarified that the activity \nis considered to be legal in that country since the parties are introduced at the soap lands \nestablishments and the sexual contact is not anonymous. Department Counsel agreed \nwith this characterization of the law in that country. No evidence was offered to establish \nthat any of Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior was criminal in that country. (Tr. at 34-36, 38-39.) \n \nCharacter References and Treatment Prognosis \n \n \nApplicant attached to his SOR answer a letter, dated May 22, 2019, from his \nsupervisor, who has known Applicant for five years. The supervisor describes Applicant \nas an excellent employee whose work for the U.S. Government \u201chas far exceeded . . . \nexpectations.\u201d He praises Applicant as a trustworthy, \u201cexemplary\u201d individual with sound \njudgment, who has learned from his \u201cpast transgressions\u201d and is committed \u201cto make \nhimself a better person.\u201d (AE A.) \n\n4 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s therapist saw him on three occasions in May 2019 to complete her \nevaluation and report. Applicant has continued his therapy with her since that time. She \nbelieves he is remorseful for his past conduct, and has made full disclosure to his wife, \nfamily, and work supervisors, which has helped him commit to avoid repeating his sexual \nbehavior in the future. She reported that Applicant\u2019s wife attended one therapy session \nand expressed her interest, as did Applicant, in moving forward together. Applicant has \nexpressed his relief and feels liberated that he has nothing to hide. The therapist believes \nthat Applicant\u2019s \u201cbehavior is not likely to recur.\u201d In a December 25, 2019 update, the \ntherapist wrote that Applicant \u201chas faithfully continued his treatment and has complied \nand implemented all suggested recommendations.\u201d She praised his honesty and integrity. \nShe concluded \u201cwithout reservation that there is absolutely no likelihood of there being \nany recurrence of the conduct which had been the cause of concern.\u201d (AE B; AE E.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n\n5 \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline D, Sexual Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 12 as follows: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. \n \nThe following potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline apply:  \n \nAG \u00b6 13(b): a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual \nbehavior that the individual is unable to stop; and \n \nAG \u00b6 13(c): sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. \n \n \n \n \n\n6 \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 14(b): the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or \nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 14(c): the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; \n \nAG \u00b6 14(d): the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; \nand \n \nAG \u00b6 14(e): the individual has successfully completed an appropriate \nprogram of treatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated \nongoing and consistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has \nreceived a favorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional \nindicating the behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \n \n \nAll of the above mitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior in question \nlast occurred more than three years ago and was relatively infrequent over the prior ten \nyears or so. The record evidence, including the evidence from his wife and therapist, \nestablished that the behavior is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt upon his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. With Applicant\u2019s full disclosure of his \nconduct, it no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation or duress. The behavior \nwas private, consensual and discreet, although his participation in orgy parties was not \nnecessarily private or discrete. And significantly, he is currently enrolled in therapy to help \nhim reduce the desires for pleasure that impulsively caused him to engage in the \nbehavior. He has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the treatment \nplan and has received a favorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional \nindicating that his behavior is readily controllable and unlikely to recur. \n \n \nThe Appeal Board has ruled in a case with facts somewhat similar to, but \ndistinguishable from, the record facts in the instant case. In ISCR Case No. 16-03690 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 15, 2018), the Board reversed a decision by an Administrative Judge \ngranting a security clearance to a divorced applicant, who disclosed in a polygraph that \non a number of occasions, he had travelled to Thailand for sex. On these trips, he paid \nthe owners of bars a \u201cfee\u201d to take their female employees out on \u201cdates\u201d during their \nnormal working hours. The dates usually involved sex with the women. The applicant\u2019s \nfamily, friends, and co-workers were aware of his behavior. The applicant denied that he \nhad done anything wrong and intended to continue his sexual behavior in future vacations \nto Thailand. The Appeal Board ruled that the administrative judge erred by concluding \nthat no disqualifying conditions had been established under Guidelines D or E.  \n \nIn the instant case, there is no dispute that the disqualifying conditions have been \nfully established. Applicant recognizes that what he did was wrong even if it may have \n\n7 \n \nbeen legal. His evidence has established the above-quoted mitigating conditions by his \nvoluntary disclosure of his sexual behavior to his wife, family, employer, and a \nGovernment investigator, which reduced the risk of coercion. He also accepted \nresponsibility for his actions and sought therapy to help prevent any recurrence of his \nbehavior. His therapist has determined that the therapy has been successful and that he \nhas an excellent prognosis for the future. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30 as follows: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions under Guideline J are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \n \n \nThe record evidence does not establish that Applicant engaged in any conduct that \nis criminal under the laws of the country in which the conduct occurred. Neither of the \nabove disqualifying conditions have been established. \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d), specifically: (1) the \nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n\n8 \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines D and J in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Some factors have been \naddressed in my analysis above, but others deserve further comments. I have weighed \nApplicant\u2019s sincere remorse for his past actions and his serious commitment to avoid any \nfurther actions that could jeopardize his marriage, his relationship with his child, or his \ncareer. He has maturely faced the inappropriateness of his behavior and has taken \nactions to avoid a repetition of the embarrassing and potentially compromising position of \nhis past actions. He has also received professional help to make sure that he does not \nslip back into his old pattern pursuing sexual pleasure in a secretive manner. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline D and \nthe disqualifying conditions under Guideline J, and evaluating all of the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns \nraised by his sexual conduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nGuideline D, Sexual Conduct:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct: \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interests of the United States \nto grant Applicant national security eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is granted. \n \n \n \n \nJohn Bayard Glendon \nAdministrative Judge \n",

National security eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied.  \n Statement of the Case \nIn October 2015, July 2010, and May 2005, Applicant submitted security \nclearance applications (SCA). On June 7, 2019, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR), detailing security concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.    \n\n2 \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 11, 2019, and he provided character \nreference letters, military service documents, and supporting financial documents with \nhis response. He admitted all of the SOR allegations and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. The case was assigned to me on September 16, 2019. On \nSeptember 25, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nnotice of hearing, setting the hearing for November 13, 2019. \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1-10, \nwhich were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant did not submit additional \ndocumentation, but asked that I consider the documents he previously submitted with \nhis SOR response. Applicant testified, and I held the record open until December 1, \n2019, in the event either party wanted to submit additional documentation. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on November 26, 2019. On December 3, 2019, \nApplicant provided seven documents, which I labeled as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough G. I admitted into evidence all seven documents without objection, and the \nrecord closed on December 4, 2019. \nFindings of Fact \nHaving thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, I make the following \nfindings of fact: Applicant is 33 years old. He recently earned a bachelor\u2019s degree \nin cyber security, and he is currently pursuing a master\u2019s degree. He married in 2006 \nand has three children. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 2006, and he received a top \nsecret security clearance in 2010. In 2014, Applicant received an honorable discharge \nfrom the Navy. Since 2015, he has worked for a DOD contractor as a senior cloud \nmonitoring subject matter expert, and he makes approximately $132,000 annually. (Tr. \n18-22, 26, 42)\nIn 2016, Applicant became a part-owner of a business venture, and he is \ncurrently working to obtain government contracts for cyber security work. \nApplicant testified that he is in the process of leaving his current employer so that he \ncan work full-time for his company with an annual salary of about $220,000. He \nadmitted his company is in the process of pursuing a DOD facility clearance. Applicant \npossesses a top secret security clearance and at the time of the hearing, he was \nconsidered a key management personnel for his own company. (Tr. 22, 63-68) \nSOR allegation \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant falsified information on his October \n2015 SCA when he answered \u201cNo\u201d to the following question: \u201cSection 25- Investigations \nand Clearance Record \u2013 Denied Clearance Have you EVER had a security clearance \neligibility/access authorization denied, suspended, or revoked?\u201d Applicant had his \nSensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) access revoked in June 2015 by a \nU.S. government agency. In his response to the SOR he denied intentionally \nfalsifying this question, as he thought his Visitor Access Request (VAR) was denied \ndue to failing a polygraph on three separate occasions. Until the receipt of the SOR, \nhe did not realize that his SCI access was revoked by a Federal government \nagency. At the hearing, Applicant testified that he answered this question \u201cNo\u201d \nbecause he thought the question pertained to security clearances only, and he never \n\n3 \nhad a security clearance denied, suspended, or revoked. It was his impression that he \nwas walked out of a building after the Federal government agency no longer \nsupported his VAR. (Tr. 23-24; SOR response) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that Applicant falsified information on his July 2010 SCA when \nhe answered \u201cNo\u201d to the following question: \u201cSection 23 \u2013 Illegal Use of Drugs or \nDrug Activity In the last 7 years, have you illegally used any controlled \nsubstance, for example, cocaine, crack cocaine, THC, narcotics, stimulants \u2026?\u201d \nAnother Federal government agency reported that Applicant used marijuana on \nseveral occasions from 2003 to 2007, he sold marijuana from 2003 to 2005, and in \n2003 he sold crack cocaine. In his SOR response, Applicant admitted that he \nintentionally falsified his drug history when he completed the 2010 SCA, but he also \nclaimed that the illegal drug activity occurred during his teenage years only. He \nintentionally falsified the SCA after he was advised by unnamed individual(s) to never \ndivulge his illegal drug use due to potential negative consequences while he was an \nenlisted member in the U.S. Navy. Applicant was subsequently granted a top secret \nDOD security clearance in 2010. (Tr. 25-29, 37) \nAt the hearing, Applicant denied ever using illegal drugs while he was an active \nmember of the Navy. He admitted that he sold marijuana in high school, for a combined \ntotal amount of less than $1,000. He also noted that some of the details he provided \nduring his polygraph to another government agency was due to being under stress, and \ntrying to divulge as much information as possible to pass the polygraph test. He \nprovided \u201cclarification\u201d to the timeframe and his involvement with illegal drugs, in an \neffort to appease the polygrapher. (Tr. 25-29, 37) \nDuring questioning by Department Counsel, Applicant admitted that he stole \nthree 30-gallon bags full of marijuana from a farmer who employed him during his high \nschool years. He and a couple of his friends sold some of that marijuana for \napproximately two or three thousand dollars. Applicant told the polygrapher that he used \nillegal drugs while he was an enlisted member of the U.S. military, and his last use of \nillegal drugs occurred in 2007. At the hearing, Applicant claimed that he was mistaken \nabout the dates. He only used and sold illegal drugs during the years he attended high \nschool, and he stopped all illegal drug activity upon his graduation from high school in \n2004. Applicant testified that after he reported to the polygrapher that he last used \nmarijuana in 2007 while a member of the U.S. military, he was able to pass that \nparticular portion of the polygraph exam. At the hearing, Applicant admitted he made \nthose statements to the polygrapher, but claimed they were inaccurate. When \nquestioned by Department Counsel if he had ever traded marijuana for prescription \nmedication, Applicant initially denied doing so, but then recanted and said he did trade \nmarijuana for prescription medications when he was about 14 years old. He also denied \nselling crack cocaine and stated he would have traded crack cocaine for something \nelse, but then admitted he had received money for crack cocaine, most likely $10 or \n$20. (Tr. 29-33, 35-37; GE 3) \n\n4 \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that Applicant falsified information on his May 2005 SCA when \nhe answered \u201cNo\u201d to the following questions: \u201cSection 27 \u2013 Your Use of Illegal Drugs \nand Drug Activity Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have \nyou illegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack \ncocaine \u2026?\u201d and \u201cSection 29 \u2013 Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity In the last 7 \nyears, have you been involved in the illegal purchase, manufacture, trafficking, \nproduction, transfer, shipping, receiving, or sale of any narcotic, depressant, stimulant, \nhallucinogen, or cannabis for your intended profit or that of another?\u201d Applicant admitted \nhe also intentionally falsified his 2005 SCA because he was worried that his past history \nwith illegal drugs would prevent him being accepted in the U.S. Navy. He testified that \nhis intentional falsification of the 2010 and 2005 SCAs did not show a pattern of \ndeception, which occurred due to unique circumstances, bad advice from others, and \nhis immature age. (Tr. 37-41) \nParagraph 2 of the SOR cited financial considerations security concerns. SOR \u00b6 \n2.a alleges that Applicant is delinquent on a mortgage account in the amount of\n$24,761. Applicant admitted this debt and discussed how he suffered financially after he\nwas no longer permitted to work at the Federal government agency when he was\ndenied SCI access. In 2015, his income dropped from $140,000 to $90,000, and he had\na difficult couple of years managing his bills. He recently has been able to manage his\ndebts now that his income is approximately $132,000. Applicant claimed that his\nmortgage account was current. Department Counsel requested he send in\ndocumentation to support his claim. Applicant sent documentation in December 2019\nwhich showed that his loan modification was approved, and in November 2019, he paid\nnominal late fees in the amount of $103. (Tr. 41-44; AE C)\nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges that Applicant is delinquent on a student loan in the amount of \n$677, with a loan balance of $13,304. Applicant provided documentation showing that \nhis student loan was placed in forbearance status from September 2019 through \nDecember 2019. In March 2019 he started his master\u2019s degree program. As long as he \nis enrolled in school, he will not be required to pay on his student loan. According to the \ndocumentation Applicant provided, he is required to start making monthly payments of \n$102 in January 2020. (Tr. 44-46; AE F) \nSOR \u00b6 2.c alleges that Applicant is delinquent on a furniture account that was \ncharged off in the amount of $5,065. Applicant admitted this debt, and claimed he was \ncurrent with a payment plan he initiated with the creditor. Applicant provided \ndocumentation in December 2019 which showed he made four consecutive monthly \npayments of $130 starting in August 2019. (Tr. 46-47; AE B) \nSOR \u00b6 2.d alleges that Applicant is delinquent in the amount of $2,314 on a \nmilitary credit card account referred for collection. This debt was incurred while he was \na member of the Navy. Applicant provided documentation that his collection account of \n$2,511 was paid in full just before the hearing. (Tr. 47-48; AE E) \n\n5 \nSOR \u00b6 2.e alleges that Applicant is delinquent for an iPad loan account charged \noff in the amount of $1,724. Applicant admitted this debt but claimed that he was current \nwith a payment plan with the creditor. Applicant provided documentation in December \n2019 which showed he made four consecutive monthly payments of $132 since August \n2019. (Tr. 48; AE A) \nSOR \u00b6 2.f alleges that Applicant is delinquent to an insurance provider in the \namount of $236. Applicant admitted this debt but claimed that the account was currently \npaid in full. He provided documentation which showed he settled this account for $188 \nin June 2019. (Tr. 48; AE D) \nSOR \u00b6 2.g alleges that Applicant is delinquent on a medical account for $100. \nApplicant admitted this debt. In July 2019, this account was paid in full. (Tr. 49-50) \nSOR \u00b6 2.h alleges that Applicant is delinquent for a gym membership account in \nthe amount of $153. Applicant admitted this debt and stated this debt was currently paid \nin full. Documentation he provided showed this debt was paid in October 2018. (Tr. 50; \nSOR Response; AE G) \nSOR \u00b6 2.i alleges that Applicant is delinquent to a state university in the amount \nof $911. Applicant admitted this debt was for a returned tuition payment from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs after he failed an undergraduate class. Applicant \nclaimed he paid this debt. Department Counsel requested verifying documentation since \nJuly 2019 documentation showed a previous balance of $1,824 had been reduced to an \noutstanding balance of $912. Applicant did not provide supporting documentation by the \ntime the record closed. There is insufficient evidence to show that this debt has been \nresolved. (Tr. 50-52) \nApplicant admitted he \u201cpaused\u201d making retirement contributions in August 2019 \nin an effort to use the extra money to pay off his debts. Since 2015, he has been paying \na monthly percentage of his income into his retirement account. He also admitted he \nhad received financial counseling when he was a member of the military. (Tr. 56-57, 61) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \n\n \n6 \n \n \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 an \u201capplicant is responsible \nfor presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct:  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \nprovide truthful and candid answers during national security investigative \nor adjudicative processes. \u2026 \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable under the established facts \nin this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official,\u2026 in making a recommendation relevant to a \nnational security eligibility determination.  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant deliberately falsified relevant and material information \non his SCAs he completed in 2005, 2010, and 2015. Applicant admitted he intentionally \nfalsified two of the three SCAs. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n \n(d) the individual acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \n \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant admitted he deliberately \nfalsified the SCAs he completed in 2005 and 2010. He intentionally failed to disclose the \n\n \n8 \n \n \ncircumstances of his significant illegal drug history. His 2005 falsification enabled him to \nbecome a member of the U.S. Navy, and in 2010, it resulted in him being granted a top \nsecret DOD security clearance. Applicant denied intentionally falsifying his 2015 SCA \nabout whether his security clearance eligibility or access had been denied. He claimed \nhe thought only his VAR was denied due to failing a polygraph on three separate \noccasions. In 2015, Applicant provided details of his illegal drug history to a \npolygrapher, but he was unable to pass the polygraph tests. Applicant was walked out \nof the Federal government agency building, and his income was reduced significantly \nafter he was unable to perform specific job duties that required SCI access.  \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Applicant provided inconsistent and self-serving statements \nconcerning his illegal drug history that he previously reported in 2015 to a polygrapher. \nHis claim that he did not intentionally falsify his 2015 SCA regarding whether his \nsecurity clearance eligibility/access had been denied is also not credible. He was a U.S. \nmilitary member for eight years, and he has been a government contractor since 2015. \nHe has held a top secret security clearance since 2010. With this background, Applicant \nwas certainly aware in 2015 that he needed SCI eligibility/access to work for a Federal \ngovernment agency. He is not a first-time applicant for a DOD security clearance, and \nhis claim of ignorance about the investigative process for attaining his SCI access is \nunconvincing. Overall, I find Applicant demonstrates a pattern of dishonesty, which \ncasts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and overall good judgment. Personal \nconduct security concerns are not mitigated. \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets \nas well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \n\n \n9 \n \n \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, \n2010), the Appeal Board explained: \n \n \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally meet \nthe substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations under [Directive] \u00b6 \nE3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden shifts to applicant to establish \neither that [he or] she is not responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG           \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \nmitigating conditions. \n \n \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable in this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago,  was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nThe SOR alleges nine delinquent debts totaling $35,941. Applicant\u2019s debts \nresulted from his significant salary cut in 2015 and the resulting lack of income. Whether \nthis is a circumstance largely beyond his control is questionable.  \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nApplicant has either paid, settled, or is currently paying eight SOR debts in \u00b6\u00b6 2.a \nthrough 2.h. The only SOR debt that remains unresolved due to insufficient evidence is \nthe debt for $911 in \u00b6 2.i.  \n \n \nApplicant made sufficient progress resolving his delinquent debts. In December \n2019, he provided sufficient documentation of numerous paid or current accounts. He \nreceived financial counseling, and he has made enough progress resolving his \ndelinquent debts to show his good faith efforts to resolve his delinquent debts. There \nare clear indications that his financial problem is being resolved, and his finances are \nunder control. Future financial problems are unlikely to occur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are \nestablished, and financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. \n \n \n \n \n \n  Whole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. This SOR highlights serious offenses that \nprovides insight to a person\u2019s character and integrity. Although he has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F, under Guideline E, Applicant\u2019s explanations are \nself-serving and incredible. I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated security \nconcerns raised by his personal conduct. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his \nburden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue his \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n      AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \n      Against Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \n      FOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.i: \n \n \n      For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 13, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security \nconcerns under Guidelines H, drug involvement, E, personal conduct, and F, financial \nconsiderations, explaining why it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national \nsecurity to grant security clearance eligibility. The DOD CAF took the action under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective for any adjudication made on or after June 8, 2017. \nOn August 1, 2019, Applicant answered the SOR, admitting the allegations set forth in \nParagraph 1 and denying the remaining allegations.  He initially requested a decision \nbased on the record, then requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on August \n\n2 \n \n2, 2019. After granting two motions for continuance requested by Applicant, I scheduled \nthe hearing for January 27, 2020. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a \nnotice of hearing, as requested, and it was held as scheduled. I received nine Government \nexhibits (GE 1 \u2013 GE 9) and ten Applicant\u2019s exhibits (AE A - AE J), together with the \ntestimony of Applicant. Also, I incorporated into the record a copy of Department Counsel\u2019s \ndiscovery letter to Applicant (Hearing Exhibit I). The transcript (Tr.) was received on March \n12, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 54-year-old single man. He is a veteran of the U.S. Army, serving on \nactive duty from 1987 to 1990, and in the National Guard from 1990 to 1995. (GE 9; AE I) \nWhile on active duty, he earned an associate\u2019s degree. (Tr. 54) After leaving active duty, \nhaving been discharged honorably, Applicant enrolled in college, completing a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in 1996 and a master\u2019s degree in computer science in 1999. He is a software \ndeveloper who has been subcontracting with various federal government contractors since \n1996. (Tr. 55; GE 1 at 11) Throughout his career, Applicant has been in positions that have \nrequired either a security clearance or public trust eligibility. (Tr. 61) \n \n \nApplicant is highly respected among his professional peers. According to his current \nproject supervisor, he has a stellar work ethic, logging long hours to get the job done under \nhighly stressful situations. (AE H) A project manager for another contractor with whom he \nworks, characterizes him as an outstanding software developer who \u201ccontinues to impress \nthe customer with the quality of his work, his integrity, and his can-do attitude.\u201d (AE H at 3) \n \n \nApplicant has been using marijuana intermittently since 1982. Although the majority \nof his use occurred before 1997, some of his marijuana use since then occurred while he \npossessed a security clearance. (Tr. 58) According to Applicant, he has only used \nmarijuana twice since 2014.   (Tr. 57)  \n \n \nSince 1996, Applicant has completed three security clearance applications and one \napplication for public trust eligibility. Each application contained a question concerning \nillegal drug use within the seven years preceding the completion of the respective \napplication. Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d on each application. (GE 1 \u2013 3; GE 5) After \ncompleting the 1996 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed his omission to an \nagent before being confronted, explaining that he overlooked the section of the security \nclearance application that required the application to be answered with complete honesty.  \n(GE 9 at 5) Specifically, he told the agent that when he completed an application for \nacceptance into the Army in the late 80s, the recruiter told him not to admit past drug use \nbecause it could have a detrimental effect on his career. (GE 9 at 5) He followed this \nadvice when he completed the 1996 clearance application. \n \n \nBetween 2007 and 2014, Applicant submitted two security clearance applications \nand an application for a position of trust. He omitted the marijuana use from each \napplication, explaining  that the legality of marijuana in several states since the completion \nof the 1996 security clearance application rendered the question of \u201cillegal\u201d use of \n\n3 \n \nmarijuana ambiguous. (GE 8 at 2) Marijuana was not legal, nor has it ever been legal in the \nstate where Applicant used it. (Tr. 59-60) \n \n \nApplicant continued to use marijuana over the years despite promising during the \ncourse of each previous investigation that he would quit. (Tr. 61-62) In January 2020, \nApplicant executed an affidavit swearing to abstain from all drug involvement in the future. \n(AE J) \n \n \nAs of July 2017, Applicant owed approximately $38,000 in unpaid federal income \ntaxes. (AE D) Applicant attributes his tax debt to financial problems that began in 2006, \nwhen he overextended himself financially by purchasing a home using a non-traditional \nmortgage loan product that he could not afford. (Tr. 15)  The house was underwater for all \n11 years that he owned it. (Answer at 6) Furthermore, Applicant testified that his financial \nproblems stemming from the home were exacerbated in 2008 when the market crashed, \nadditionally decreasing the home\u2019s value. (Tr. 15)  \n \n \nIn 2013, Applicant experienced a brief period of unemployment, which coincided \nwith the acceleration of the mortgage payments. (GE 6 at 7) Consequently, by the end of \nApril 2013 Applicant had exhausted his savings, and he was unable to pay his federal \nincome taxes for 2012. (Tr. 16, 68)  By November 2013, the tax year 2012 income tax debt \nhad grown to $18,875. (GE B) That month, Applicant began making $5,000 monthly \npayments through an installment agreement that he negotiated with the IRS. (AE B) By \nNovember 2014, he had satisfied the income tax debt for tax year 2012. (Tr. 70; AE C at \n13) Although he had satisfied the 2012 tax delinquency, he had incurred a tax debt for tax \nyear 2013, which totaled $10,570. (AE C at 14) Per the installment agreement, Applicant\u2019s \n2013 income tax debt rolled over automatically to tax year 2014, and has continued to roll \nover to successive years after each preceding year\u2019s tax debt is satisfied. (AE C at 14)  \n \n \nApplicant continues to make payments on his income tax debt through his \ninstallment agreement. Once he satisfies the tax debt for one year, the IRS then applies \nthe payments to the successive tax year. (Tr. 71) Applicant\u2019s tax debt spiked in 2017, the \nyear he short sold his home. (AE C at 14) Since then, he has been paying $1,000 monthly. \nCurrently, the balance of his tax debt is approximately $16,000. (Tr. 17) \n \n \nApplicant earns $111,000 annually. (Tr. 73) He anticipates receiving a raise. He will \napply the additional funds to the tax debt. \n \n \nApplicant is a successful gambler. (Tr. 76) He has mastered the laws of probability \ngoverning table games, minimizing the \u201chouse advantage.\u201d (Tr. 76) In 2008, Applicant won \n$100,000 through casino gambling. (Tr. 75) In 2012, he won $15,000. (Tr. 76) When asked \non cross-examination about additional gambling winnings, Applicant acknowledged more \nwinnings, but could not specifically recall the corresponding years, explaining that at \u201ctimes \n[he] win[s] $10,000, there\u2019s times [he] win[s] $20,000, [and] there\u2019s times [he] win[s] \n$100,000.\u201d (Tr. 76)  \n \n\n4 \n \n \nSOR subparagraph 2.e alleges that Applicant falsified his response to Section 26 of \nthe June 2014 security clearance application when he failed to disclose the outstanding tax \ndebt from tax years 2012 and 2013. Applicant did not file his 2012 tax return on time. \nHowever, he applied for an extension, negotiated a payment plan, and had begun \nexecuting it in November 2013, six months before he completed the security clearance \napplication. (AE B) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \n\n5 \n \nchanges;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement \n \nThe security concerns about drug involvement are set forth in AG \u00b6 24, as follows: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment, and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of marijuana use, some of which occurred while he possessed a \nsecurity clearance, triggers the application of AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany substance misuse,\u201d and AG \n\u00b6 25(f), \u201cany illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or holding a \nsensitive position.\u201d  \n \n \nApplicant has only used marijuana twice since 2014. However, in light of the multiple \nbroken promises to quit smoking marijuana, the infrequency of use has limited probative \nvalue. Similarly, Applicant\u2019s history of broken promises to quit smoking marijuana \nminimizes the probative value of his 2020 affidavit expressing an intention to quit smoking \nmarijuana. I conclude that none of the mitigating conditions apply, and that Applicant has \nfailed to mitigate the drug involvement security concerns. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nUnder this guideline, \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) Moreover, \u201cof special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or adjudicative \nprocesses.\u201d (Id.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s omission of information from four investigative processing applications \nwarrants the application of AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification \nof relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine national security eligibility or trustworthiness, or award \nfiduciary responsibilities.\u201d Applicant is an educated and highly successful man. Under these \n\n6 \n \ncircumstances, neither his explanation for omitting the drug use from his 1996 security \nclearance application, nor his explanation for withholding this information from successive \napplications is credible. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies without mitigation. \n \n \nAlthough Applicant did not file his 2012 federal income tax return on time, he timely \napplied for an extension, negotiated an installment payment agreement, and had begun \nmaking payments consistent with the plan before the completion of the security clearance \napplication. Under these circumstances, his income tax payments were never in delinquent \nstatus. I conclude Applicant\u2019s negative response to Section 26 of his 2014 security \nclearance application was not a falsification, rendering AG \u00b6 16(a) inapplicable. I resolve \nSOR subparagraph 2.e in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18) Applicant\u2019s outstanding income tax debt triggers the application of AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability \nto satisfy debts,\u201d AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d and AG \u00b6 \n19(f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local income tax returns or \nfailure to pay annual federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant contends that he initially fell behind on his income tax payments when the \nhousing market crashed in 2008, shortly after he had overextended himself on the \npurchase of a home. However, between 2008 and 2012, the first year Applicant did not pay \nhis federal income taxes on time, he won more than $100,000 through casino gambling \u2013 \nmoney which could have been spent on keeping his finances stable. AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . \n. and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d does not apply.  \n  \n \nApplicant \u201chas made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to . . . pay the \namount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements.\u201d (AG \u00b620(g)) He has sold his \nhome, the source of his financial struggles.  \n \n \nAt the end of the day, I cannot reconcile Applicant\u2019s characterization of himself as a \ngambling savant who can win large sums of money at will, with his characterization of \nhimself as a man who was so in over his head financially that he was unable to pay his \nincome taxes when due over the course of several years. Consequently, I conclude that \nApplicant has failed to mitigate the financial considerations security concern. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nApplicant is an outstanding software developer who is highly respected by \ncolleagues within the information technology community. This positive attribute is \ninsufficient to overcome the negative security inferences posed by his marijuana use, his \n\n7 \n \nrepeated broken promises to stop using marijuana, his failure to disclose his marijuana \nuse, as required, on his investigations processing applications, and his outstanding income \ntax debt. Under these circumstances, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a \u2013 2.d: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.
