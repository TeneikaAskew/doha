    "summary": "Findings of Fact DOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owed judgment debts of $2,550 entered against him and in favor of child support enforcement in June 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and January 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and that state tax liens or warrants had been entered against him in April 2006 for $2,534 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), June 2007 for $2,879 (SOR \u00b6 1.d), October 2002 for $3,244 (SOR \u00b6 1.f), and August 2003 for $3,150 (SOR \u00b6 1.g). DOHA also alleged that Applicant owed $19,110 in delinquent child support (SOR \u00b6 1.e), a financial judgment of $9,864 to a consumer debt collection agency (SOR \u00b6 1.h), and two delinquent utility debts of $182 (SOR \u00b6 1.i) and $163 (SOR \u00b6 1.j). Applicant denied the allegations and explained that the child support matter and related judgment and tax liens in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g had been resolved. He averred that the balance of SOR \u00b6 1.h was about half of the amount alleged, and that he had paid the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j. After considering the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 54-year-old janitor who had worked for a defense contractor in state A from April 2008 until mid-May 2009, when he was laid off because of lack of work due to no security clearance (Tr. 109-10, 125). He is subject to being recalled by the defense contractor should his clearance be adjudicated favorably. His supervisors would like to have him back at work (Tr. 112, 161-64).

Marine, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant fell behind in his child support and on a credit card account. He also\nowed past due balances on two utility services accounts. His financial delinquencies are\nattributable in part to unemployment and low wages, and to the criminal activity of a\nformer employer. The child support issue has been resolved, and he has paid $4,100\ntoward his delinquent credit card debt. Clearance is granted.\nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on April 2, 2008. On April 24, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued to Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR) detailing the security\nconcerns under Guideline F that provided the basis for its decision to deny him a\nsecurity clearance and refer the matter to an administrative judge. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\nJuly 29, 2009\n\n2\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the\nDepartment of Defense as of September 1, 2006.\nOn May 18, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to me on May 28, 2009, to conduct a hearing and to determine\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant. On June 2, 2009, I scheduled a hearing for June 17, 2009.\nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Five government exhibits (Ex. 1-5) were\nadmitted, Exhibits 3 and 4 over Applicant\u2019s objections. Applicant represented himself\nwith the assistance of a former supervisor. Applicant, this supervisor, and a state\nemployee familiar with Applicant\u2019s child support situation, testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf,\nas reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on June 26, 2009. Applicant also submitted  20\nexhibits (Ex. A-T), which were admitted without any objections.\nAt Applicant\u2019s request, I held the record open until July 1, 2009, for him to submit\nproof of debt repayment. On July 24, 2009, Applicant submitted through his former\nsupervisor copies of documents pertaining to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j. On July 26, 2009,\nApplicant forwarded records pertinent to the closure of his child support case, and\nevidence of recent money orders showing payments on SOR \u00b6 1.h. Department\nCounsel indicated on July 7, 2009, that the government did not object to the admission\nof the post-hearing submissions, and the documents were accepted into the record as\nfull exhibits (Ex. U-W).\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owed\njudgment debts of $2,550 entered against him and in favor of child support enforcement\nin June 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and January 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and that state tax liens or\nwarrants had been entered against him in April 2006 for $2,534 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), June 2007\nfor $2,879 (SOR \u00b6 1.d), October 2002 for $3,244 (SOR \u00b6 1.f), and August 2003 for\n$3,150 (SOR \u00b6 1.g). DOHA also alleged that Applicant owed $19,110 in delinquent child\nsupport (SOR \u00b6 1.e), a financial judgment of $9,864 to a consumer debt collection\nagency (SOR \u00b6 1.h), and two delinquent utility debts of $182 (SOR \u00b6 1.i) and $163\n(SOR \u00b6 1.j). Applicant denied the allegations and explained that the child support matter\nand related judgment and tax liens in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g had been resolved. He\naverred that the balance of SOR \u00b6 1.h was about half of the amount alleged, and that\nhe had paid the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j.\nAfter considering the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 54-year-old janitor who had worked for a defense contractor in\nstate A from April 2008 until mid-May 2009, when he was laid off because of lack of\nwork due to no security clearance (Tr. 109-10, 125). He is subject to being recalled by\nthe defense contractor should his clearance be adjudicated favorably. His supervisors\nwould like to have him back at work (Tr. 112, 161-64). He requires a secret clearance.\n\nOn June 2, 2009, the current assignee reported a $6,864.63 balance due, apparently after payment\n1\nof the $3,000, which was received by the collection agency on May 14, 2009 (Ex. K). Applicant was unaware\nof the judgment before his background investigation for his security clearance (Tr. 132).\n3\nApplicant was married in August 1985. He and his ex-wife had three children by\nDecember 1987. In 1994, they went through a bitter divorce and, although Applicant\nwas court-ordered to pay child support in state B from October 1995 (Ex. 4), he had no\ncontact with his children (Ex. 1, Tr. 95). Applicant struggled to pay his child support on\ntime due to periods of unemployment (Tr. 137). In about December 2001, his wages\nwere ordered garnished to pay child support (Tr. 137-39). From June 2000 to December\n2002, he worked at a local liquor store. In about June 2001, he began working part-time\nas a security officer at $7 an hour for a local casino in state A while continuing to work\nweekends at the liquor store (Tr. 90). In May 2004, he was laid off by the casino (Ex. 1).\nShortly after Applicant began working at the casino, a collection agency obtained\na $9,864 judgment against him in August 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.h) to recover a delinquent\ncredit card balance (Ex. 4).  His wages at the casino were garnished by state B for child\n1\nsupport at $125 a week from March 11, 2002, through April 1, 2002 (Ex. A). He made\nno payments on his child support through the remainder of his employ at the casino.\nTax warrants (liens) were filed against him by state B in October 2002 for $3,244.16 and\nin August 2003 for $3,150 because he was delinquent in his child support (Exs. 3, E). In\nJune 2004, the county child support enforcement division obtained a financial judgment,\nand state B issued a tax lien against him, for $2,550 (Exs. 4, E). \nApplicant worked as a painter for a local building contractor part-time when\nneeded from about June 2004 to December 2005 (Ex. 1, Tr. 91). In January 2005, a tax\nwarrant was issued against Applicant in the amount of $2,550 for failure to pay the child\nsupport judgment (Ex. E). In early April 2005, Applicant\u2019s federal income tax refund of\n$794.29 was intercepted and applied to his child support (Ex. M). In early May 2005,\nApplicant was hired by a local janitorial company at $9.25 per hour, although his wage\nincreased slightly to $10 an hour shortly after he started. As of January 2006, the\njanitorial company was his only employer. Applicant\u2019s wages were garnished at $125\nper week for child support from August 5, 2005, through April 21, 2007, with the\nexceptions of the weeks of October 9, 2005, when $70.98 was taken, and July 2, 2006,\nand February 25, 2007, when nothing was taken (Exs. 2, B). Applicant\u2019s employer was\nobligated under state law to forward the child support payments to state B (Ex. 2).\nApplicant assumed his employer was submitting the full child support payments\nto state B. On February 22, 2006, Applicant was notified by the child support processing\ncenter that a payment issued by his employer on his behalf in early February 2006 for\n$125 had been returned on the basis of account closed (Exs. 2, A, J). Applicant was\nassured by his employer that it was a mix-up because she had changed banks, and that\npayments were being made (Tr. 153).\nAfter issuing three insufficient funds checks to state B in January/February 2006\n(Exs. 2, J, Tr. 24), Applicant\u2019s employer continued to garnish Applicant\u2019s wages but did\n\n4\nnot forward the monies to state B as required. In April 2006, state B issued a tax\nwarrant against Applicant in the amount of $2,534.73 (Exs. 3, E). His federal income tax\nrefund was intercepted in April 2006 and applied to his child support (Ex. M). In\nNovember 2006, his employer paid $500 to the child support division on Applicant\u2019s\nbehalf, but again failed to comply until April 2007, when the company resumed\nsubmitting the $125 weekly child support to state B (Ex. A).\nApplicant was laid off by the janitorial company in April 2007 (Ex. 1). He did not\npay his child support over the next year because he was unemployed and could not\nafford to make the payments. He was denied unemployment because his former\nemployer indicated that he had left the job, which he maintains was not true (Tr. 93). His\nsister helped him out by allowing him to live with her (Tr. 94). In June 2007, state B\nobtained a judgment against Applicant in the amount of $2,879 for nonpayment of child\nsupport (Exs. 3, 4). His income tax refunds were intercepted in 2007 and 2008 and\napplied to his child support debt (Exs. A, M).\nIn April 2008, Applicant began working as a janitor for a defense contractor. On\nJuly 14, 2008, he paid $1,065.70 to settle a delinquent credit card debt of $2,131.39\n(not alleged in SOR) (Ex. 2). From August 15, 2008, through October 23, 2008,\nApplicant paid state B $75 per week toward his child support (Exs. 2, N). In November\n2008, the defense contractor began garnishing his wages for child support, at $125 per\nweek through December 2008, and at $50 per week thereafter (Ex. A). That fall, he also\npaid a $182 gas services debt delinquent since November 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.i) (Exs. 2, 3,\nP, U). He obtained a money order of $163 to pay a delinquent electric bill owed since\nJune 2007 (Exs. 2, 3), but it was returned to him by the credit union because the power\ncompany could not identify the account to apply the payment (Ex. R). Applicant first\nlearned of these two debts when he reviewed a copy of his credit report during his\nbackground investigation (Tr. 131).\nApplicant learned from former coworkers that the janitorial services company had\nwithheld wages from them but had not submitted their payments (Tr. 16). In late\nSeptember 2008, he filed a formal complaint with state A\u2019s Department of Labor (Exs.\nD, I). A wage enforcement agent investigated and determined that the janitorial services\ncompany had withheld $8,695.98 in total wages from Applicant\u2019s pay for child support\nbut had forwarded only $3,195.98 to state B\u2019s support enforcement division (Ex. C. Tr.\n17). The investigator filed a complaint in superior court in state A charging Applicant\u2019s\nformer employer with failure to pay wages, a felony offense under state law (Ex. C, Tr.\n31-32). As of June 2009, Applicant\u2019s former employer had been arraigned but had not\nyet been tried on the charge (Tr. 40).\nOn March 9, 2009, state B closed his child support account as he no longer owed\na balance (Ex. V). On March 23, 2009, the tax warrants issued by state B for\nnonpayment of child support were all vacated (Ex. E). On April 3, 2009, state B\nintercepted his federal income tax refund of $1,497 and applied it to his child support\n(Ex. M). On April 14, 2009, state B refunded Applicant $2,900 in overpayment of his\nchild support (Ex. F). On May 27, 2009, the income tax refund of $1,497 applied to his\nchild support was refunded to him as well (Ex. O). In May 2009, Applicant resolved his\n\n5\nold debt to the electric company (SOR \u00b6 1.j) (Exs. G, U). Forgetting that he had already\nsatisfied the debt in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, he paid $183 to the gas company in May 2009 (Exs. G,\nP).\nIn May 2009, Applicant negotiated a settlement of the judgement debt in SOR \u00b6\n1.h with the new assignee. The creditor agreed to accept $5,000 to settle the debt on\nreceipt of $3,000 on or before May 14, 2009, and one payment of $2,000 on or before\nJune 30, 2009 (Ex. K). Applicant paid $3,000 on May 13, 2009 (Exs. G, U), $800 on\nJune 18, 2009, and $300 on June 25, 2009 (Ex. W). As of June 2009, he was collecting\nunemployment compensation at $380 a week (Tr. 109, 118).\nApplicant moved into his current residence in mid-October 2008. He has paid his\nmonthly rent of $750 (Ex. S) on time and his utilities are current as of June 2009 (Ex. T,\nTr. 120). He has no active credit card accounts (Ex. 4).\nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the\nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security\nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security\nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines\n(AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are\nuseful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These\nguidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the\ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\n\n6\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern about finances is set out in AG \u00b6 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nApplicant has a history of late child support payments that led to garnishment of\nhis wages beginning in about December 2001. Child support records show no payments\nwere made on Applicant\u2019s account between May 2002 and May 2005. Between August\n2003 and June 2004, two judgments and four tax warrants (liens) were issued against\nhim for failure to comply with court-ordered child support. Applicant was a victim of\ncriminal activity in that a former employer did not forward more than $5,000 in wages\nwithheld to state B\u2019s child support agency, but there were times before 2006 and after\nApril 2007 when Applicant was responsible for paying his child support on time and did\nnot do so. Furthermore, a financial judgment was issued against him in August 2001\nbecause of a delinquent credit card, and two utility debts (gas and electric) were placed\nfor collection. AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d AG \u00b6 19(b), \u201ca\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.\nAG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d applies in mitigation of\nhis child support delinquency when he worked for the janitorial company. Applicant\nreceived wage statements showing that his employer was garnishing his wages for child\nsupport between August 2005 and April 2007, and he relied in good faith on his\nemployer who indicated she was making the payments.\nAG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\n\n7\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d is clearly implicated. The criminal behavior\nof his former employer was not reasonably foreseeable. AG \u00b6 20(b) also applies to the\nextent that lack of income was a factor in his failure to timely address his child support\ndelinquency from April 2007 to April 2008. Applicant testified that he was out of work for\none year after he was laid off from the janitorial company. He was denied\nunemployment when his former employer claimed he walked off the job. Applicant\ndenies he left the company voluntarily, and his former employer\u2019s version is viewed\nskeptically given its failure to turn over about $5,000 of Applicant\u2019s wages to state B\u2019s\nchild support agency.\nMoreover, the evidence supports AG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith\neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d Applicant made $75 child\nsupport payments directly to the child support agency from mid-August 2008 through\nlate October 2008, until his employer began garnishing his wages. He was unaware of\nthe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h-1.j before the recent clearance investigation. In the fall of 2008,\nhe satisfied the gas debt and attempted to resolve the electric services debt. As of May\n2009, the utility debts had been paid. His child support case was closed in March 2009\nbecause he was no longer obligated to pay child support (his children are now adults)\nand arrearage had been paid. The state vacated the tax warrants.\nBy the close of the record, Applicant had fully resolved all the issues but for the\njudgment debt in SOR \u00b61.h. On or before mid-May 2009, the creditor agreed to accept\n$5,000 to settle the debt. Applicant paid $3,000 before he was laid off by the defense\ncontractor because of no clearance. He paid an additional $1,100 toward the debt in\nJune 2009. The creditor is free to reserve the right to modify or revoke the settlement\noffer, since Applicant fell short of paying the full $2,000, but he has done enough for AG\n\u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the conduct\nand all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\n8\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person\nanalysis in financial cases stating, in part, \u201can applicant is not required, as a matter of\nlaw, to establish that he has paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is\nrequired is that an applicant demonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve\nhis financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019\u201d ISCR Case\nNo. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). Concerns are\nlegitimately raised about Applicant\u2019s financial judgment because of nonpayment of his\nchild support obligation for three years. While he may not have known about the\noutstanding credit card judgment against him, his reliance on credit for purchases\nenjoyed by him or his family was knowing and willful. Yet his recent behavior has been\nfinancially responsible. He has resolved most of his debt and lives within his means on\nlimited income. Since his children are grown, he no longer has the financial burden of\nchild support. He does not have an active credit card account. Under the circumstances,\nthe financial problems are not likely to recur.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Blank, Jr. Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on October 16,\n2007. On June 16, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline B\n(Foreign Influence) for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 1, 2009. He elected to have\nhis case decided on the record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the\ngovernment\u2019s written case on December 9, 2009. Applicant received a complete file of\nrelevant material (FORM) on December 16, 2009, and was provided an opportunity to\nfile objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s\nFebruary 22, 2010\n\nThe Government submitted seven items in support of its contentions.\n1\n2\ncase.  Applicant submitted additional information by January 15, 2010. The case was\n1\nassigned to me on February 2, 2010. Based upon a review of the case file, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The request and the\nattached source documents were included in the record as attachments. (I-XVI) The\nfacts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated July 1, 2009, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g of the SOR. He submitted additional\ninformation to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.\nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He was born and\nraised in China, he immigrated to the United States in August 1995. Applicant became a\nnaturalized United States citizen in May 2001. He submitted a security clearance\napplication on October 16, 2007. \nApplicant graduated from an American high school in August 1998. He received\nan undergraduate degree and ultimately a master of science degree from a U.S.\nuniversity in 2006. Currently, he is employed as an engineer for a contractor. He has\nbeen in his current position since March 2007.\nApplicant married a woman he was introduced to online, who is a citizen of\nChina. He met her in person in China in 2006. In October 2008, they were married in\nthe United States. She resides in the United States with Applicant. She holds a\npermanent resident card and intends to become a United States citizen when all the\nconditions are met in approximately two years (Item 2). Applicant maintains that his wife\ndoes not show any interest in his work, and she works in a medical field at a university. \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law was an accountant for a local city planning department\nin China, where she is a citizen and a resident. She retired in November 2007. Applicant\nplans to sponsor her to the United States next year (Item 2). His father-in-law is\ndeceased.\nApplicant has an aunt, three uncles, and several cousins who are citizens and\nresidents of China. He maintains contact with them through his mother who has been a\nnaturalized U. S. citizen since 2001. Applicant speaks to his relatives in China on the\ntelephone at holiday or festival times. He maintains that he does not contact them\nseparately or apart from the phone conversations that his mother has with them. \n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s aunts and uncles are retired. He maintains they have not worked\nsince the 1990's. He knows they were teachers, doctors, and civil engineers. His cousin\nworks for a highway traffic station collecting tolls. Applicant describes his cousin\u2019s work\nas civil service, and not military or government service.\nApplicant contends that his relatives in China do not know what Applicant does\nfor a living. He emphasized that \u201cthey do not possess any type of information as to what\nkind of job I currently have, nor did they express any interest.\u201d\nApplicant traveled to China in 1996, 1999, 2002, 2006, and 2007. In 1996, 1999,\nand 2002, he traveled with his mother. Applicant was on spring or summer breaks from\nhigh school or college. He reported that he accompanied his mother to China because\nhe had nowhere else to go, and that it was expected that he would visit his family. He\nexplained that it is common practice in his culture to have family members provide\nshelter and food for visiting relatives. The visits were sometimes three months in length.\nWhen Applicant was in college, he visited his Chinese relatives from January 2002 until\nApril 2002 (Item 7). \nIn 2006 and 2007, Applicant visited China to meet the woman he would marry.\nHe spent the time on vacation. He had no personal financial business activities. He\nreported the visit to the Facility Security Officer (FSO) for his company. He was briefed\nand debriefed before and after the visits. He acknowledged that he made a short trip to\nChina in January 2008, and he acknowledged that he visited his relatives (Item 7).\nIn a 2008 sworn affidavit, Applicant acknowledged that he has maintained\ncontact with a childhood friend (XW), who is a citizen and resident of China. He is a\nchemistry salesman in Shanghai. Applicant\u2019s friend introduced him to Applicant\u2019s wife in\n2005. Applicant had online contact with his friend from 2005 until September 2008. Prior\nto 2005, Applicant maintained contact with XW by email on a limited basis (Item 2).\nApplicant maintains that his last contact with XW was in 2008, when Applicant was\nmarried (Response to FORM).\nApplicant\u2019s other childhood friend (ZL), who is a citizen and resident of China,\nmaintained contact with Applicant while they were both in college from 2003 until 2006.\nApplicant maintains he had very limited contact prior to 2003. The frequency declined\nafter 2006 when they graduated from college. ZL is a software engineer who works for a\nnon-governmental agency in China. ZL was present at Applicant\u2019s wedding in 2008. He\nhas not contacted him since, and he has no information about his current address\n(Response to FORM, July 2009).\nApplicant admits that he has other friends who are citizens of China. He\nacknowledges that he met these two students, who were married, while he was in the\nuniversity. They both were students of engineering. Applicant recalls that in 2005 and\n2006, he had daily contact with them and shared an apartment with them. He left the\napartment when he graduated in 2006. Applicant received a phone call or two from\n\n4\nthem after 2006. He has not had contact with them since February 2008. He has no\nfurther information about them.  \nApplicant stressed that he has lived in the United States for almost half his\nlifetime. He does not have any affiliation to any Chinese political entity. He has more\nAmerican friends than foreign contacts. Applicant emphasized that his contacts with\nfamily and friends in China are limited. He has no sympathy for the Chinese\ngovernment. His allegiance is to the United States. He has confidence that as a well-\neducated, professional United States citizen, he would not sell or disclose any classified\ninformation to a foreign government (Item 2). He loves the freedom in the United States\nand knows the duty of \u201cbeing a United States citizen.\u201d \nI take administrative notice of the following facts. China (PRC) is an authoritarian\nstate whose power is centralized in the Chinese Communist Party. In foreign relations,\nChina and the U.S. have been rivals since the Cold War, with particular disagreement\non the status of Taiwan, and China has continued to resist what it considers to be\nsuperpower dominance by the U.S., despite improving economic relations. The United\nStates is a primary intelligence target of China because of the U.S. role as a global\nsuperpower; its substantial military, political, and economic presence in the Pacific Rim\nand Asia; its role as a developer of advanced technology that China requires for\neconomic growth; and the large number of Americans of Chinese ancestry, who are\nconsidered prime intelligence targets by the PRC. China uses legal and illegal means,\nincluding espionage, to obtain military related systems and technologies from the U.S.\nChina has a poor human rights record and its citizens lack freedom to peacefully\nexpress opposition to the political system or to freely change those in charge of the\ngovernment. There are many high profile cases involving monitoring, harassment,\ndetention, arrest, and imprisonment of journalists, writers, activists, and defense\nlawyers, many of whom were seeking to exercise their rights under the law. There is a\nlack of due process and new restrictions on lawyers that further limit the progress\ntoward the rule of law. There are tight restrictions on freedom to practice religion and\nfreedom to travel. According to the U.S. State Department, the government of China\nengages in serious human rights abuses including, extrajudicial killings, torture, coerced\nconfessions of prisoners, and forced labor.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n\n5\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\n  \nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nThe security concern for Foreign Influence is set out in AG & 6:      \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\n\n6\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associates with a\nrisk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 7(a), a Acontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or a resident in a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion\u201d may create a security concern. Similarly, under AG & 7(d) \u201csharing living\nquarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion\u201d\nmay raise security concerns. Applicant\u2019s wife is a citizen of China, although she resides\nin the United States. Applicant met his wife through a friend in China. His mother-in-law\nis a resident and citizen of China. Applicant has family connections with China, as his\naunt, three uncles and cousins are residents and citizens of China. Applicant and his\nmother have visited their family on numerous occasions since 1999. Applicant spent\nvacations in China and met his wife in person in China in 2006. He again visited her in\n2007 and in 2008. Some of Applicant\u2019s visits were three months in length. Applicant has\nchildhood friends with whom he has maintained a level of connection. China is a country\nwhose human rights record is dismal and the potential for abuse is high. Applicant\u2019s\nfamilial relationship with citizens and residents of China creates a heightened risk of\npotential exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion. The evidence is\nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from foreign influence. Under AG \u00b6 8(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the\ncountry in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group,\norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.\u201d Applicant has lived more than\nhalf his life in China. Applicant maintained contact with childhood friends who are\ncitizens and residents of China. Applicant met his wife through such a friend in China.\nApplicant and his wife have been married since 2008. Although his wife maintains her\nresidency in the U.S., she is a Chinese citizen. She has emotional ties with her mother\nin China. Applicant\u2019s relatives are in China. He has visited his family on six occasions.\nHe stayed with his relatives on many such occasions. His last visit was in 2008.\nApplicant and his wife keep in touch with their families in China. Applicant is a\nnaturalized U.S. citizen, however, there is a heightened risk due to his wife\u2019s status and\nhis family ties to China. Unfortunately, China is a country that causes concern in the\narea of potential exploitation and coercion which makes Applicant vulnerable. His\ncontact with his family cannot be construed as minimal. This creates a potential conflict\nof interest. The evidence does not raise this potentially mitigating condition. \n\n7\nUnder AG & 8(b), security concerns may be mitigated where Athere is no conflict\nof interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign\nperson, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep\nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be\nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d As noted above,\nApplicant has longstanding, close ties with his family. Applicant is a naturalized citizen;\nhowever, there is a heightened risk due to his family ties to China. Unfortunately, China\nis a country with a tendency to cause concerns in the area of potential exploitation and\ncoercions which makes Applicant vulnerable. His contact with his family cannot be\nconstrued as minimal This creates a potential conflict of interest.  \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not,\nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in\na foreign country and an Applicant has frequent, non-casual contacts with that relative,\nthis factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could\npotentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and\nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family\nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or\nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, if\nan applicant\u2019s family member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or\nif the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the United States. \nHowever, the complicated, competitive relationship of the PRC with the United\nStates places a significant, but not insurmountable, burden of persuasion on Applicant\nto demonstrate that his relationship with his relatives living in China and his relatives in\nthe United States with close relationships to family members living in China does not\npose a security risk and he is not in a position to be forced to choose between loyalty to\nthe United States and his family living in China. With its mixed human rights record, and\npolitical, economic, and military rivalry with the United States, it is conceivable that\nChina would target any Chinese citizen or former citizen living in the United States in an\nattempt to gather valuable information from the United States.\nChina is a country whose human rights record is dismal and the potential for\nabuse is high. Applicant\u2019s familial relationship with citizens and residents of China\ncreates a heightened risk of potential exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure\nor coercion. China\u2019s intelligence operatives seek classified or economic information from\nUnited States businesses and/or governmental agencies. Applicant\u2019s connections to his\nfamily members and his mother-in-law create a potential conflict of interest because\nthese relationships are sufficiently close to raise a possible security concern about his\ndesire to help these relatives living in China by providing classified information. \nEvidence that \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or\n\n8\nexploitation\u201d is potentially mitigating under AG & 8(c). Applicant traveled to China\nnumerous times to visit his family. He also contacts them on a regular basis. I conclude\nthis potentially mitigating condition does not apply.\nAfter a review of the remaining mitigating conditions, I find that none of them\napplies in this case.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nA Guideline B decision concerning China must take into consideration the\ngeopolitical situation in the PRC. The PRC has a dismal human rights record, The PRC\nis one of the world\u2019s most aggressive nations in the collection of United States\nintelligence and sensitive economic information.       \nApplicant was born and raised in China. He has lived in the United States since\n1995. He became a United States citizen in 2001. He received his undergraduate and\nmaster degree in 2006 from an American university. His mother is a naturalized United\nStates citizen. He has worked for a defense contractor since 2007.\nApplicant has traveled to China on six occasions since 1996. He visited his family\nand also childhood friends in China. He went to China to meet a woman who would\nbecome his wife. He married in 2008. His last trip to China was in 2008. He maintained\ncontact with some childhood friends as late as 2008. The familial ties are close and the\npractices carried out by China create a heightened security risk. I am persuaded by the\ntotality of the evidence that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national\nsecurity to grant Applicant a security clearance. In reaching my decision, I considered\nthe evidence as a whole, including the appropriate factors and guidelines. \n\n9\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from foreign\ninfluence.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 49-year-old security officer for a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. Applicant is single and has no children. He has worked for the same contractor for 15 years and has held a security clearance since 1993 (Tr. 26, 29). Between 2002 and 2008, he accumulated over $40,000 in credit card and auto financing debts, and became overextended before he realized it (Tr. 28, 34). In or about 2005, Applicant tried working with a credit counseling firm to resolve his debt problems at a cost of $600 a month, but to no avail (Tr. 33). Still concerned about his debts, Applicant petitioned for Chapter 13 wage-earner\u2019s relief in January 2009 (see exs. 2 and A through C; Tr. 30-34). Before filing his petition, he completed a pre- requirement of on-line financial counseling in December 2008 (see ex. A). He scheduled $49,000 in unsecured claims that included all of the debts listed in the SOR. Applicant\u2019s plan was approved by the bankruptcy court in February 2009. Its terms obligated him to make monthly payments of $677 to the bankruptcy trustee (see exs. A and B; Tr. 34).

The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AGs) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued\nafter September 1, 2006.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on July 21, 2009, and requested a hearing.  The\ncase was assigned to me on September 1, 2009, and was scheduled for hearing on\nDecember 7, 2009.  A hearing was held on the scheduled date.  At the hearing, the\nGovernment's case consisted of six exhibits (ex.). Applicant relied on one witness\nMarch 4, 2010\n\n2\n(himself) and three exhibits.  The transcript (Tr.) was received on December 15, 2009.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is granted.\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have (a) filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy\nin January 2009 and (b) accumulated 22 debts exceeding $20,000.  In his response to\nthe SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations without explanations. \n      \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 49-year-old security officer for a defense contractor who seeks a\nsecurity clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are\nadopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant is single and has no children.  He has worked for the same contractor\nfor 15 years and has held a security clearance since 1993 (Tr. 26, 29).  Between 2002\nand 2008, he accumulated over $40,000 in credit card and auto financing debts, and\nbecame overextended before he realized it (Tr. 28, 34).  \nIn or about 2005, Applicant tried working with a credit counseling firm to resolve\nhis debt problems at a cost of $600 a month, but to no avail (Tr. 33).  Still concerned\nabout his debts, Applicant petitioned for Chapter 13 wage-earner\u2019s relief in January 2009\n(see exs. 2 and A through C; Tr. 30-34).  Before filing his petition, he completed a pre-\nrequirement of on-line financial counseling in December 2008 (see ex. A).  He scheduled\n$49,000 in unsecured claims that included all of the debts listed in the SOR.  Applicant\u2019s\nplan was approved by the bankruptcy court in February 2009.  Its terms obligated him to\nmake monthly payments of $677 to the bankruptcy trustee (see exs. A and B; Tr. 34).  \nBefore petitioning for Chapter 13 relief, Applicant tried working with a credit\ncounseling firm to resolve his debt problems at a cost of $600 a month, but to no avail\n(Tr. 33).  Unable to pay off his creditors directly, he turned to his Chapter 13 option (Tr.\n33-34).\nSince February 2009, Applicant has made regular payments of $677 a month to\nthe bankruptcy trustee (see ex. B; Tr. 34-35).  He expects to complete his plan in six to\nseven years (Tr. 34).\nApplicant has no credit cards at the present and lives by himself in a mobile home\nhe leases for $670 a month (see ex. A; Tr. 35-36).  He has a net income of $2,800 a\nmonth (Tr. 37).  His expenses consist of his monthly rent ($670), utilities ($200), internet\nuse ($80), and his trustee payments ($677). He assures he has regained control of his\nfinances and will not let his finances deteriorate again (Tr. 39-40).  His assurances are\nsincere and made in good-faith.\n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s father extolled Applicant\u2019s love for his country (Tr. 45).  He described\nApplicant\u2019s youth as problem-free. Applicant enjoys his work, has had no security\nviolations, has good fitness reports, and receives annual pay increases of about three\nand one-half per cent (Tr. 40, 46).\n \nPolicies\nThe AGs list guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the decision-\nmaking process covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that\ncould create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as\nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. These guidelines include \"[c]onditions that could raise a\nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (disqualifying conditions), if any, and many of\nthe \"[c]onditions that could mitigate security concerns.\u201d These guidelines must be\nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted,\ncontinued, or denied. The guidelines do not require administrative judges to place\nexclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the\nguidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is to be evaluated in the\ncontext of the whole person in accordance with AG \u00b6 2(c) \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a)\nof the revised AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent\nguidelines within the context of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed\nto examine a sufficient period of an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be\nmade about whether the applicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following AG \u00b6 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy concerns are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\n\n4\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known\nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds\nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. AG \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nUnder the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for\nsecurity clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do so is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires administrative\njudges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record,\nthe ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in\nlarge part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all adversarial\nproceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and\nlogical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the judge cannot draw factual\ninferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR; and (2) it must demonstrate that the\nfacts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or his security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.  Because Executive Order 10865 requires that all\nsecurity clearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, \u201csecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is an experienced employee of a defense contractor who accumulated\ndelinquent debts over an extended period of time.  Concerned about the state of his\nfinances, he sought financial counseling, and successfully petitioned for Chapter 13 relief\nin January 2009.  He has continued to make his required monthly payments under his\napproved plan and estimates six to seven years to complete his plan.  His accrued debt\ndelinquencies raise continuing security concerns over the stability of his finances.   \nApplicant\u2019s pleading admissions of the debts covered in the SOR (sometimes\nreferred to as official admissions) negate the need for any independent proof (see\n\n5\nMcCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 262 (6  ed. 2006)). All but one of his listed debts (creditor\nth\n1.k) are fully documented in his latest credit reports, and provide ample independent\nproof of his debts.  Applicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent debts (since included in his\nChapter 13 bankruptcy petition) warrant the application of two of the disqualifying\nconditions (DC) of the financial consideration guideline: DC \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and DC \u00b619(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations.\u201d  \nWith almost a year\u2019s worth of regular trustee payments under his approved\nChapter 13 plan to his credit, Applicant may be credited with good, sustaining progress\nin fulfilling the requirements of his plan. To date, he has made at nine regular payments\nof $677 to the bankruptcy trustee and established a pretty good track record of payment\ncompliance to demonstrate his earnest commitment to resolving his debts and restoring\ncontrol of his finances. Applicant\u2019s circumstances and good-faith repayment efforts\nentitle him to apply several mitigating conditions: MC \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so\nlong ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment,\u201d and MC \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d\nBecause Applicant obtained some earlier financial counseling and completed a\npre-bankruptcy counseling requirement, he is entitled to some application of MC \u00b6 20(c),\n\u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d as well.\nIn this case, Applicant\u2019s debt delinquencies arose in large measure due to his\nfailure to responsibly manage his finances.  He could be reasonably expected to have\nexerted more responsible efforts in addressing his debts before it became necessary to\npetition for Chapter 13 relief.  See ISCR Case 03-01059 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2004).\nNot only are his listed debt delinquencies ongoing, but he failed to demonstrate any\nmaterial payment progress before turning to Chapter 13 relief in 2009.  \nIt is true, certainly, that holding a security clearance involves a fiduciary\nrelationship between the government and the clearance holder. Quite apart from any\nagreement the clearance holder may have signed with the Government, the nature of the\nclearance holder\u2019s duties and access to classified information necessarily impose\nimportant obligations of trust and candor on the clearance holder that are considerably\nhigher than those typically imposed on government employees and contractors involved\nin other lines of government business.  See Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507, 511\nn.6 (1980). \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to access classified information is required\nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance. While the\nprincipal concern of a clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is\nvulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are explicit in\nfinancial cases.  Failure of the applicant to make concerted efforts to pay or resolve his\ndebts when able to do so raises security-significant concerns about the sufficiency of the\n\n6\napplicant\u2019s demonstrated trust and judgment necessary to safeguard classified\ninformation.\nAll told, however, Applicant has established a good track record for paying his\ndebts under a court-approved Chapter 13 payment plan. He currently lives within his\nmeans; his Chapter 13 payment history is compliant with his plan requirements; and his\nprospects for successfully completing his plan are promising.  \nWhole-person assessment of Applicant\u2019s overall character and recent debt\nmanagement efforts enable him to surmount the judgment questions raised by his\naccumulation of delinquent debts.  His seasoned payment efforts under his initiated\nChapter 13 plan are enough to enable him to surmount concerns over his lack of\nhistorical progress in addressing his outstanding accounts.   \nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s\ndebt accumulations and his concerted efforts under his court-approved Chapter 13 plan\nto pay his debts, safe predictive judgments can be made about his ability to repay his\naccrued debts and restore his finances to manageable levels commensurate with his\nholding a security clearance. Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the\nallegations covered by subparagraphs 1.a through 1.v. \nIn reaching my recommended decision, I have considered the evidence as a\nwhole, including each of the factors and conditions enumerated in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs.\nFormal Findings \nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate\nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):       FOR APPLICANT\nSubparas 1.a through 1.v:\n              For Applicant\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance. \nClearance is granted.\n                                  \nRoger C.

On February 3, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines \nF (Financial Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 11, 2009, and requested his \ncase be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  \n \nOn April 3, 2009, Department Counsel submitted the Department=s written case.  \nA complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to the Applicant. \n \n \n1 \n \n \nJune 5, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nHe was given the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation.  Applicant received the file on April 17, 2009.  Applicant filed \na response to the FORM on May 13, 2009, within the 30 day time allowed that would \nhave expired on May 17, 2009. I received the case assignment on May 28, 2009. Based \nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated March 11, 2009, Applicant admitted the factual \nallegations in \u00b6 1 (Financial Considerations) of the SOR, with explanations. He denied \nthe factual allegations in \u00b6 2 (Personal Conduct) of the SOR.

(Items 3-5) \n \n \nApplicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in December 1998 and was discharged in \nApril 1999. The amount of debts discharged in the bankruptcy is not disclosed. (Items 3-\n7) \n \n \nSince April 2001, Applicant accumulated 13 delinquent debts totaling $9,048.  \nEight of these debts are medical accounts.  The other five debts are owed to various \ncreditors.  Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM listed 10 payments to the same creditor, \na collector listed in the SOR as being owed $10.  None of these payments are directly \nlinked by Applicant to specific debts in the SOR.  Three of the payments are $9.96, \n$8.07, and $10.20, the amounts closest to the $10 owed to that one collector.  Three \nother debt payment sheets merely state the account is \u201cPaid in Full\u201d without a payment \namount.  The total amount paid as shown in Applicant\u2019s Response is $240.63.  But \nnone of the account numbers listed by Applicant match the account numbers listed in \nthe credit reports submitted by the Government.

He answered Question 28a \n(debts delinquent more than 180 days in the past seven years) and Question 28b (debts \ncurrently more than 90 days delinquent) with \u201cno\u201d responses.  In fact, Applicant\u2019s debts, \nlisted in the SOR, met both criteria at the time he completed the form.  He certified on \nthe form his answers were true and correct.  Applicant should have answered both \nquestions with positive responses and listed the debts which were delinquent then.  \nApplicant explains in his Answer that he knew the Government would check his credit \nreport, and thought the questions referred to debts not listed in the credit report. (Items \n3-7, Answer) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes two conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \n&19: \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \n(a) an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying; and,  \n \n (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant accumulated 13 delinquent debts between 2000 and 2008 totaling \n$9,048 after being discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1999.  Applicant has a net \nmonthly income of $2,328.98, but did not pay his delinquent obligations over the past \nsix years. Six of the delinquent accounts are less than $100, and two other debts are \nmore than $100 but less than $200.  Two other delinquent debts are more than $200 \nbut less than $1,000.  All of these debts could have been paid very easily by Applicant \nout of his net income.  At the same time he is not paying these debts, he purchased a \nhouse in 2007. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying \nconditions, requiring a closer examination. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20 they are as follows: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due \ndebt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate \nthe basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue; and, \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems in 1998 and 1999 would qualify him for application \nof AG \u00b6 20 (b) at that time.  But he admits he has worked steadily since 2002, \npurchased a house in 2007, and has a net income of $2,238.98 every month.  He has \nnot acted responsibly since 2002 by allowing these debts to become delinquent, \nespecially those under $100.  Therefore, this mitigating condition does not apply under \nhis present circumstances. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s Response to the FORM purports to show he is paying 10 delinquent \ndebts.  He paid $240.63 on those debts, three of which did not show an amount paid on \nhis Response documents.  Applicant did not connect those payments to any specific \ndebt listed in the SOR, except I could find one collector with a $10 account which was \nthe same collector listed in all of Applicant\u2019s Response payments.  Therefore, only one \n$10 debt payment could be confirmed, which was Subparagraph 1.d.  The burden of \nproof and persuasion is on Applicant, and he should have clearly identified which \npayment applied to the specific debts listed in the SOR.  AG \u00b6 20 (d) is applicable to \nonly one $10 debt. \n \nThe remaining mitigating conditions do not apply under the facts.  Therefore, I do \nnot need to make specific statements about each of them. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of \nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security \nclearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or \nadministrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited to meeting \nwith a security investigator for subject interview, completing security forms \nor releases, and cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation; \nand, \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions \nof \ninvestigators, \nsecurity \nofficials, \nor \nother \nofficial \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness \ndetermination. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security \nclearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative; \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of \nsensitive corporate or other government protected information: \n \n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the \nworkplace;  \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and, \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources. \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in \nanother country, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or \nthat is legal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve \nas a basis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or \nintelligence service or other group; \n \n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the \nindividual to the employer as a condition of employment; and, \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 (a) is the only disqualifying condition applicable.  Applicant did \nnot disclose his delinquent debts in answering Questions 28a and 28b on his SF-86.  \nThat form requires full disclosure by any applicant, even if the Government may have \naccess to credit or other records to verify the disclosed information.  Applicant\u2019s excuse \nfor not answering the questions truthfully was that he knew the Government could get \nhis credit records, and he assumed the questions referred to items not on the credit \nrecords.  However, Applicant fails to explain how he knew what was or was not on his \ncredit record, and he failed to use the \u201cAdditional Comments\u201d section of the SF-86 to \nexplain his debts or his rationale for not disclosing them.  I conclude Applicant knew he \nhad delinquent debts and chose not to disclose them as required by the SF-86. His \nreasons for not disclosing them, because he thought the questions on the SF-86 only \napplied to debts not listed on his credit report, is not persuasive. Therefore, it is logical \nto conclude he deliberately failed to disclose them to the Government. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment \nwas caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate \nadvice of authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon \nbeing made aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the \ninformation, the individual cooperated fully and truthfully. \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate \nthe \nstressors, \ncircumstances, \nor \nfactors \nthat \ncaused \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of \nquestionable reliability; and, \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased \nor occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \nApplicant did not take any action after completing his SF-86 and before being \nquestioned by the Government investigator to correct this deliberate failure to disclose \nhis delinquent debts.  None of these mitigating conditions apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires each case must be judged on its own merits.  Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy and \nthen continuing to fail to pay his debts over the past decade is serious misconduct by \nApplicant.  The majority of these debts was small, and could have been paid long ago.  \nApplicant obviously ignored his financial obligations.  There is a repeated failure to pay \nthese debts from 2001 to the present.  Applicant was a mature adult when he failed to \npay his debts, and then deliberately failed to disclose them to the Government.  He \nvoluntarily made these decisions; no one coerced him to do them.  There is no evidence \nof any rehabilitation. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence is shown by \nApplicant\u2019s futile attempt to show he paid some debts, but did not submit proof they \nwere the debts of concern to the Government in the SOR, serving only to obfuscate the \nissue. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations \n\n \n10 \n \n \nand personal conduct security concerns.  I conclude the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept against \nApplicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e to 1.o \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The government alleged in the SOR that Applicant owes approximately $47,436 for 28 delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.t, 1.v - 1.cc), and that her mortgage was foreclosed in 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.u). Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations, except for SOR \u00b6 1.b, and SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.y - 1.aa. As to her denials, she disputed that those debts were hers and submitted, with her Answer to the SOR a letter supporting her claim regarding SOR \u00b6 1.b. However, she presented no information to support her claims regarding SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.y - 1.cc. In addition to the facts established through Applicant\u2019s admissions, after reviewing the pleadings, the transcript, and exhibits, I have made the following findings of relevant fact. Applicant is 49 years old. She has worked as a long distance truck driver for over 20 years. She is single but has been married twice \u2013 from 1976 until 1982 and from 1982 until 1984. Both marriages ended in divorce, and Applicant has one adult child from the first marriage.

In her SF 86, she disclosed numerous\npast due and delinquent debts. After reviewing the results of the ensuing background\ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nwere unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with\n1\nthe national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. On February\n12, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts\nAugust 31, 2009\n\n The revised Adjudicative Guidelines were approved by the President on December 29, 2005, and were\n2\nimplemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending official revision of the Directive,\nthey supercede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.\n DoD contracts for transportation of sensitive cargo require two-person teams at all times. (Tr. 29 - 30)\n3\n2\nwhich, if proven, raise security concerns addressed in the revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG)  under Guideline F (financial considerations).\n2\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to me on May 7, 2009, and I convened a hearing in this matter on June 9,\n2009, at which the parties appeared as scheduled. The government presented three\nexhibits (Gx. 1 - 3), which were included in the record without objection. Applicant\ntestified on her own behalf. I left the record open after the hearing to give Applicant time\nto submit additional relevant evidence. However, she did not submit anything and the\nrecord closed on June 23, 2009. DOHA received the transcript of hearing (Tr.) on June\n25, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nThe government alleged in the SOR that Applicant owes approximately $47,436\nfor 28 delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.t, 1.v - 1.cc), and that her mortgage was\nforeclosed in 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.u). Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations, except\nfor SOR \u00b6 1.b, and SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.y - 1.aa. As to her denials, she disputed that those debts\nwere hers and submitted, with her Answer to the SOR a letter supporting her claim\nregarding SOR \u00b6 1.b. However, she presented no information to support her claims\nregarding SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.y - 1.cc. In addition to the facts established through Applicant\u2019s\nadmissions, after reviewing the pleadings, the transcript, and exhibits, I have made the\nfollowing findings of relevant fact.\nApplicant is 49 years old. She has worked as a long distance truck driver for over\n20 years. She is single but has been married twice \u2013 from 1976 until 1982 and from\n1982 until 1984. Both marriages ended in divorce, and Applicant has one adult child\nfrom the first marriage. (Gx. 1; Tr. 48 - 49)\nSince June 2009, Applicant has worked directly for a company driving a\ncompany-owned truck. She and her co-driver  are paid by the mile, but expenses such\n3\nas fuel and maintenance costs are borne by the company. She estimates she can earn\nabout $32,000 annually through this arrangement. From 1987 until about August 2006,\nhowever, she partnered with her live-in boyfriend, who owned the truck. He was paid by\nthe contracting company and deducted expenses (fuel, maintenance, insurance, food\nand living expenses). They shared the remaining income. After they split up in August\n2006, he took the truck with him. She became ill and was unemployed with no\ncontinuing health care until January 2007. At that time, she and a new boyfriend\npartnered to drive his truck. She estimates that from January 2007 until June 2009,\nwhen she split up with him, they grossed about $200,000 annually, but after expenses,\nthey split about $50,000 in net income. However, Applicant\u2019s boyfriend was unwilling to\nhelp her resolve any of the debts she had before they met. (Tr. 30 - 33, 35 - 36)\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n4\n Directive. 6.3.\n5\n3\nThe largest of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts is a federal income tax lien (SOR \u00b6\n1.a) filed against her for a tax year \u201cback in the early 2000s.\u201d (Tr. 54) She owes the IRS\n$15,369 (Gx. 2) after her claim of expenses against her income was disallowed. Only\nher boyfriend, who owned the truck to which the expenses were tied, was allowed to\nclaim that deduction. (Tr. 45 - 46) \nApplicant\u2019s car was repossessed in 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.I) and she still owes $11,000\nfor the remainder after resale. (Gx. 2) Applicant\u2019s medical bills (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k - 1.n)\naccrued between August 2006 and January 2007. They totaled about $8,060. (Gx. 2)\nThe remaining debts listed in the SOR are for personal credit cards, retail store\naccounts, and unpaid utilities, cable television, and cell phones. (Gx. 2) Although five of\nher debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n, 1.x, 1.z, 1.bb, and 1.cc) are for less than $200 each, she has\nnot paid or otherwise attempted to resolve any of them since being interviewed by a\ngovernment investigator about her finances in July 2008. (Tr. 40 - 41)\nApplicant asserted at hearing that, before she and her first boyfriend broke up in\n2006, she was able to pay her bills and meet her credit obligations. (Tr. 23) However,\nthe government\u2019s information shows that she was delinquent on a number of debts as\nfar back as 2003. (Gx. 2) \nPolicies\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n4\nhave access to classified information. Each decision must be a fair, impartial, and\ncommonsense determination based on examination of all available relevant and\nmaterial information,  and consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy\n5\nin the revised Adjudicative Guidelines. Decisions must also reflect consideration of the\nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept, those factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,\nconclusive. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case\ncan be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or\n\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n4\ndenial of access to classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information\npresented by the parties require consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative\nfactors addressed under AG \u00b6 18 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations).\nThe government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on\nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an\napplicant. Additionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute,\nextenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security\nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.  A person who has access\n6\nto classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based\non trust and confidence. Thus, the government has a compelling interest in ensuring\neach applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one\nwho will protect the national interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.7\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that \n[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe government presented sufficient information to support the allegations in\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.p. The facts thus established show that Applicant owes approximately\n$47,000 in delinquent debts dating back to at least 2003. Available information requires\napplication of the disqualifying conditions listed at AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations).\nApplicant denied owing SOR \u00b6 1.b, and SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.y - 1.aa. She was able to\nsupport her claim regarding SOR \u00b6 1.b, but she did not present any information\nregarding SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.y - 1.aa. Even had she established that she did not owe those\ndebts, they comprise less than 3% of her total debt. Applicant\u2019s personal circumstances\nrequire some consideration of the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\n\n See footnote 5, supra.\n8\n See footnote 7, supra. \n9\n5\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances).\nNonetheless, she did not present any information to show that she has acted to resolve\nher past due obligations or that she will, in the foreseeable future, be able to pay or\notherwise resolve her debts. Applicant\u2019s testimony is insufficient to support application\nof any of the Guideline F mitigating conditions. She has not mitigated the security\nconcerns about her financial problems.\nWhole Person Concept \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 49 years old and\npresumed to be a mature adult. There is no available information about her reliability or\ntrustworthiness that would support a prediction that she is likely to improve her finances\nso as to avoid more financial problems in the future. A fair and commonsense\nassessment  of all available information bearing on Applicant\u2019s finances shows she has\n8\nfailed to address satisfactorily the government\u2019s doubts about her ability or willingness\nto protect the government\u2019s interests as her own. Because protection of the national\ninterest is paramount in these determinations, such doubts must be resolved in favor of\nthe government.  \n9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.c - 1.cc:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto continue Applicant\u2019s access to classified information. Request for security clearance\nis denied.\n                            \n                                                    \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On April 5, 2002, a bench warrant was issued for Applicant because he failed to \ncomply with the requirements of the alcohol abuse program. Applicant\u2019s explanation for \nhis failure to complete the program was because he moved to a different state. He did \nnot contact the state where he was convicted prior to his move. He did not recall if he \npaid the fine. He admitted he drove on a suspended license from the time of his \nsentence in September 1996, until he was arrested again in March of 2000.5 \n \nIn the summer of 2002, Applicant moved to a new state and his consumption of \nalcohol increased. He was drinking approximately 10-12 pints of beer a couple of times \na week. In January 2005, he moved again to another new state to attend college. On \nJanuary 22, 2005, Applicant was cited by the campus police with an alcohol violation, \nnon-compliance with an official, and disorderly conduct. On March 4, 2005, he \ncommitted another alcohol violation on campus. He admitted he was drunk on campus, \na violation of school policy. The school disciplinary board issued him a deferred \nsuspension and barred him from residing or visiting residences halls, and he was \nrequired to complete substance abuse counseling.

He was \nsuspended from school for one year, from May 2006 to June 2007. He was required to \nattend alcohol treatment as a condition for reinstatement to school. Applicant attended \nalcohol treatment from September 2006 to November 2006. He was diagnosed as \nalcohol dependent by a medical doctor and a licensed clinical alcohol/drug counselor \n(LCADC). While in treatment he was prescribed and took Antabuse. He completed the \nrequired 21 sessions of treatment. He attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) while \nattending alcohol treatment. The discharge summary stated: \u201cFollow-up plan: 12\u2013Step \ngroup and individual psychotherapy.\u201d Applicant attended some AA meetings and saw \neither a psychotherapist or psychologist.8  \n \nApplicant testified he last consumed alcohol in September 2006. He is not \nconcerned about drinking now. He last attended an AA meeting in April 2009. He stated \nhe has not attended since then because he is busy with school and caring for his father. \nHe did not have a sponsor. He does not serve as a sponsor. He never completed the \n12-step program. He completed Step-4. He stated he intends to go back to AA when he \nmoves from his current location back to where he attended school.9  \n \nApplicant moved to Morocco in January 2007 for seven months and took classes \nwhile there. He stated he helped establish AA meetings. While there he used hashish \nabout 10-15 times. Hashish is legal in Morocco. He moved back to the U.S. in July \n2007. His suspension from college expired and he reenrolled in school.10  \n \nOn October 17, 2007, Applicant was charged by campus police with disorderly \nconduct. He had requested through the student disability service that he be permitted \nan extension of time to complete an exam because he has attention deficit disorder. He \nwas denied the extension. Applicant stated that the Director thought he was overexcited \nand she felt threatened. No alcohol was involved.11  \n \nFrom 1996 to December 2007, Applicant used illegal drugs. From June 1996 to \nJuly 2000, he used marijuana about 100 times each year. From 2000 to 2005, he used \nmarijuana about 25 times each year. From 2005 to December 2007, he used marijuana \nabout three to four times. From June 1996 to July 2000, he used cocaine three times.

From 1996 to 2000, he purchased marijuana for \npersonal use on various occasions.12  \n \nApplicant used illegal drugs with his roommates at their house. When he used \ncocaine, it was at parties. He knew the drugs were illegal, but was not concerned about \ngetting caught because he was at home. The last time he used cocaine was in late \n2005. He knew he was breaking the law. He stated he does not have a drug problem. \nHe does not consider substance abuse a link to alcoholism. He has never had to take a \ndrug test. He does not intend to use illegal drugs in the future. He still associates with \none of his former roommates, with whom he used drugs. They talk on the phone often \nand last saw each other about five months ago. In answers to interrogatories Applicant \nstated: \u201cI decided to stop using illegal substances when I chose to pursue a career in \nthe intelligence community.\u201d He further stated: \u201cI decided to stop using illegal \nsubstances because I realized I wanted more out of life. I want to help combat global \nterrorism as a valued member of the intelligence community. Once I realized this, \nstopping was not hard at all.\u201d13 \n \nApplicant completed his security clearance application (SCA) on April 4, 2008. \nHe answered \u201cno\u201d to the question asking if he had ever been charged or convicted of \nany offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs. He also answered \u201cno\u201d to the question asking \nif in the last 7 years he had been arrested for, charged with or convicted of any \noffense(s) not already listed. Applicant, did list he \u201creceived a DUI in 2000\u201d. He did not \nlist his 1995 DUI conviction. He did not list his arrest for public intoxication in June 2005. \nInitially when asked why he did not list his 1995 DUI he twice stated \u201cI didn\u2019t think to. I \nonly thought to list the DUI in 2000.\u201d When questioned if he intended to keep the 1995 \nDUI a secret, he responded: \u201cCertainly not.\u201d He went on to say regarding the 1995 \nconviction:  \n \nI\u2019m filling out this a Standard Form 86 in the hopes of getting a security \nclearance. I am well aware of all my discrepancies, of all of my \nindiscretions. And quite honestly it sucks to have to fill this out. I mean \nDUI\u2019s, marijuana smoking. It\u2019s humiliating. It doesn\u2019t make it right.14  \n \nHe further stated \u201cYes, not putting down the 1995 DUI, I didn\u2019t think to do it. I \nmean I said, \u2018all right, I\u2019ll tell them about my 2000 DUI and move on.\u2019 \u201d When questioned \nfurther he stated \u201cOkay, I\u2019m thinking, \u2018do they really need to know about a DUI that I got \nmore than ten years ago? A first offense.\u201d He then stated he decided not to list the 1995 \nDUI. I find Applicant intentionally and deliberately omitted relevant information on his \nSCA. Regarding information provided about his 2000 DUI conviction, Applicant stated in \nthe SCA: \u201cI attended a court-ordered alcohol program. The case has since been \n \n12 Tr. 109-121. \n \n13 Tr. 100-123; GE 2. \n \n14 Id. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \ndismissed.\u201d15 The court-ordered alcohol program he mentions is the one he failed to \ncomplete when he left the state, for which the bench warrant was issued. He stated at \nhis hearing that he was told by someone at the court that his case was dismissed. He \nbelieved that it meant there was no longer a file on him. I did not find Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony credible.16  \n \nOn his SCA, Applicant listed that he used marijuana from 1996 to 2000, \napproximately 25 times. He listed that he used cocaine from June 1996 to 2000, \napproximately three times. He failed to list that he used marijuana from 2000 to 2005, \napproximately 25 times, and he again used it from 2005 to December 2007, three to \nfour times. He did not list his 2005 cocaine use. He did not list his hashish use because \nit was legal in Morocco. In answers to interrogatories, Applicant again did not list his \nmore recent drug use. He admitted at his hearing that he \u201clow balled\u201d the number of \nuses on his SCA. He stated: \n \nI low balled this number because filling out the original questionnaire, the \noriginal SF 86, I\u2019m thinking to myself, \u2018My God, if I let the U.S. Government \nknow that I smoked marijuana maybe 100 times a year between 1996 and \n2000, its laughable. What\u2019s the point in even filling out the questionnaire? \nThey\u2019ll never give me a security clearance.17 \n \nHe admitted he deliberately falsified the number of time he used illegal drugs. He \nexplained he now realizes he did not have to divulge some of his illegal drug use \nbecause it fell outside of the time period of \u201csince the age of 16 or in the last 7 years \nwhichever is shorter.\u201d He believed he made a mistake by including the information on \nhis drug use from 1996 to 2000. He acknowledged that regardless what information he \nprovided, he was required to tell the truth.18 \n \nApplicant stated in his answer to the SOR that he has been in recovery since \nDecember 2007. He explained what he meant is that he has not had any alcohol or \ndrugs since then.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n15GE 1 at page 27.  \n \n16 Tr. 129-137. Applicant\u2019s omissions about his 1995 DUI and public intoxication convictions, and \nincomplete information about the court ordered alcohol program are not considered for disqualifying \npurposes, but will be considered when analyzing his credibility and the \u201cwhole person.\u201d \n \n17 Tr. 137-144, 152-154.  \n \n18 Id.; GE 1. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \nColombia19 \n \n \nColombia is a constitutional, multi-party democracy and the second most \npopulous country in South America. Any person born in Colombia is considered a \nColombian citizen. There are travel warnings for U.S. citizens by the Department of \nState highlighting the dangers of violence by narcoterrorist groups and other criminal \nelements in Colombia. Foreigners continue to be victims of threats, kidnappings, and \nother criminal acts and there are severe restrictions on travel to and within Colombia for \nAmericans residing there for official duties. Victims of violence have included journalists, \nmissionaries, scientists, human rights workers, and tourists including children. The \nSecretary of State has designated three Colombian groups as Foreign Terrorist \nOrganizations that have carried out bombings and other attacks. They have also \ntargeted critical infrastructure, public recreation areas and modes of transportation. \nThey have also targeted civilians, government workers, politicians and soldiers. One \nterrorist organization held three U.S. citizen government contractors as hostages for five \nyears. The government of Colombia\u2019s record on human rights has improved, but there \nare still serious problems, including unlawful and extrajudicial killings, forced \ndisappearances, insubordinate military collaboration with criminal groups, torture and \nmistreatment of detainees, and other serious human rights abuses. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common-sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n \n19 All of the information was taken from HE I through IV. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concerns regarding foreign influence:  \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \nI have considered all of the foreign influence disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 \n7. I have especially considered the following: \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion, and \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual's desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \nApplicant has inconsistent and infrequent contact with a woman who is a \nColombian national and works at the Colombian embassy. Their relationship is platonic \nand casual. There is no evidence that it would create a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, pressure or inducement. There is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s infrequent \ncontact with her creates a conflict of interest. Applicant has not seen her in several \nmonths and although they appear to be friends, there is not an emotional commitment. I \nfind none of the foreign influence disqualifying conditions apply. \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \n \n \nI have considered all of the evidence in this case and the disqualifying conditions \nunder Drug Involvement AG \u00b6 25 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) any drug abuse; and \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia. \n \n \nApplicant has a significant history of marijuana use. He also has used cocaine. \nHe admitted he purchased marijuana. I find all of the above disqualifying conditions \napply. \n \nI have considered all of the evidence in this case and the mitigating conditions \nunder Drug Involvement AG \u00b6 26 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate \nperiod of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic \nrevocation of clearance for any violation; and \n\n \n10 \n \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s illegal drug use from 1996 to 2007 was frequent. He decreased the \nfrequency in the latter years, but was still a consistent abuser. He last used it in \nDecember 2007. His motivation for discontinued use is career development. Applicant\u2019s \nperiod of abstinence is less than two years. Although hashish was not illegal when he \nused it, he did continue to use mind altering drugs. Most of Applicant\u2019s use of illegal \ndrugs was not during a period of youthful indiscretion, but was rather while he was \nadult. I do not find there were unusual circumstances. I do not find mitigating condition \n(a) applicable.  \n \nApplicant has not used illegal drugs since December 2007. He indicated his \nintent not to use them in the future. He has contact with only one of his friends with \nwhom he used drugs. He appears to be devoted to his college course work. It appears \nApplicant\u2019s motivation for abstaining from use of illegal drugs is due to his goal to work \nin the intelligence field. It also appears he is ready to put his life in order. I find mitigating \ncondition (b) applies.  \n \nApplicant has not participated in a drug treatment program. I find mitigating \ncondition (d) does not apply. \n \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption:  \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \n \nI have considered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 22 including:  \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol \ndependent; \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \n(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed \nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol \ntreatment program; and \n \n \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, \nevaluation, treatment, or abstinence. \n \n \n \nApplicant was diagnosed by a medical doctor and licensed alcohol counselor as \nalcohol dependent. He has had numerous alcohol incidents, including criminal charges \nand school violations, resulting in his suspension from college. He failed to comply with \na court ordered alcohol program which resulted in a bench warrant being issued. \nApplicant had a consistent pattern of excessive drinking. I find all of the above \ndisqualifying conditions apply.  \n \n \n \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 23 and especially \nconsidered the following: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous, or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who Is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program.  \n \nApplicant has abstained from drinking alcohol since September 2006. Prior to \nthen he had a consistent pattern of alcohol abuse. I find mitigating condition (a) applies \nbecause Applicant has abstained from alcohol consumption for almost three years. He \nhas not had any alcohol-related incidents in three years. I find mitigating condition (b) \napplies. Applicant successfully completed alcohol rehabilitation in September 2006. It \nwas recommended that he continue to participate in AA, complete the 12-step program, \nand attend individual psychotherapy. Applicant has participated in AA, but at present his \nattendance is sporadic. He does not have a sponsor. He has completed four steps of \nthe 12-step program. Finally, I find (d) only partially applies, because although Applicant \ndid complete an alcohol rehabilitation program, he is somewhat sporadic in his \n\n \n12 \n \n \n                                                          \nparticipation with AA, when regular participation was recommended. He also is not \nactively engaged in a 12-step program and has not received a favorable prognosis from \na duly qualified medical professional.  \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 sets out the security concern relating to criminal conduct:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person=s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person=s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions under Criminal Conduct AG \u00b6 31 \nand especially considered the following: \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;  \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted; and \n \n(e) violation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a court-mandated \nrehabilitation program. \n \n \nApplicant has numerous arrests, charges and convictions, including for DUI, \ndriving on a suspended license, and public intoxication. Applicant used illegal drugs \nregularly for more than ten years. He purchased illegal drugs. He violated the terms of \nhis probation by driving on a suspended license. He failed to complete a court-ordered \nalcohol program, thereby resulting in the issuance of a bench warrant. Applicant \nintentionally and deliberately omitted relevant information on his SCA, which constituted \na felony offense.20 There is sufficient evidence to raise all of the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n \n \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for criminal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 23 and especially considered the following: \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n20 Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. \n\n \n13 \n \n \n \nApplicant repeatedly violated the law for more than ten years. He has two \nconvictions for DUI. He showed a repeated disregard for the court-mandated \nsuspension of his driver\u2019s license. He intentionally omitted relevant information from his \nSCA. Based on his long history of criminal violations, deliberate omissions, and his \nfailure to comply with his probations, I find none of the mitigating conditions apply.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have specifically considered the following: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to considerations of: (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule \nviolations; and  \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another \ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is \nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a \nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group. \n \n \nApplicant admitted he deliberately failed to divulge important relevant information \non his SCA pertaining to his drug usage because he knew it would hinder his ability to \n\n \n14 \n \n \nobtain a security clearance. He deliberately minimized his drug usage. Applicant may \nnot have had to divulge some of his drug use because it was outside the period of time \nrequested. However, I find that when he chose to provide such information, he had a \nduty to tell the truth and provide accurate information and not deliberately provide false \ninformation. In addition to Applicant\u2019s omissions on his SCA, he also has a history of \nviolations he committed while attending college, to include alcohol violations, non-\ncompliance with an official, disorderly conduct, receiving a deferred suspense, being \nbarred from residing or visiting residence halls, and finally being suspended from school \nfor a year for violating the school\u2019s alcohol policy. Applicant also used hashish from \nJanuary 2007 to July 2007. Hashish was not illegal in the country where Applicant used \nit, so it is not disqualifying. It is somewhat disturbing that he stated his motivation for \ndiscontinuing his drug use was because he wanted to get into the intelligence field, yet \nhe chose to use a mind altering drug, that is illegal in the U.S., while pursuing a \ncurriculum where government employment was likely. I find all of the above \ndisqualifying conditions apply. \n  \n \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 and especially \nconsidered the following: \n \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith effort to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened  under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and  \n \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \n \nApplicant intentionally falsified his security clearance application. He felt that if he \nwas truthful, l it would reduce his opportunity of obtaining a security clearance. He did \nnot correct the falsification before he was confronted with the facts. His intentional \nomissions are not minor, nor are they mitigated by the passage of time. There are no \nunique circumstances that would relieve Applicant from telling the truth. His conduct \ncasts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. Applicant also has a \nseries of violations that occurred while he was attending college that resulted in being \nsuspended for a year. All but one of these violations was the result of his alcohol \ndependency. I find he has acknowledged his alcohol dependency and obtained \ncounseling. He has also taken positive steps to remain sober. I find mitigating conditions \n\n \n15 \n \n \n(d) and (e) apply to Applicant\u2019s conduct which was the result of his alcohol dependency. \nI do not find any mitigating conditions apply to his intentional omissions on his SCA.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has a long history of drug \nabuse, alcohol dependency, criminal violations, rules violations, and personal conduct, \nincluding lying on his SCA. He has abstained from alcohol use for three years. He last \nused illegal drugs in December 2007.  \n \nFor more than ten years Applicant exercised a disregard for the law. Not only on \nhundreds of occasions did he abuse illegal drugs and misuse alcohol, thereby resulting \nin DUI and suspended license convictions, but he also failed to abide by the courts\u2019 \norders imposed on him as part of his sentences. Alcohol was a big factor in his poor \njudgment. However, even after he started his present period of abstention from the use \nof alcohol, he continued to use illegal drugs. Although hashish was not illegal because \nhe used it in Morocco, one has to question his commitment to turning his life around and \nhis pursuit to a career in the intelligence field based on his actions. One also has to \nquestion his commitment to sobriety, when his motivation for discontinued drug use is \ndue to career motivation. It is also troubling that Applicant was attending AA and was \nabstaining from alcohol consumption, but not drug use.  \n \nI am not convinced that a sufficient period of time has elapsed to test his \ncommitment to abstaining from future drug use. Applicant\u2019s long history of alcohol and \ndrug abuse, and criminal conduct does not reflect a period in his life of youthful \nmisconduct. He was well beyond those years. Instead, it reflects a disregard for \ncompliance with rules, whether they are imposed by a legislature or by school officials. \n\n \n16 \n \n \nHe clearly made a conscious decision regarding information he wanted the government \nto be made aware about his background. Rather than providing honest thorough \nresponses as was required, he intentionally gave incomplete and inaccurate \ninformation. Applicant has been going to school and pursuing a difficult curriculum. It \nappears he is taking steps towards moving his life in the right direction. However, he \nhas a long history reflecting questionable and illegal conduct that will continue to follow \nhim until he can show a considerable period of consistently law-abiding conduct. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns arising under the guidelines for Foreign \nInfluence and Alcohol Consumption, but failed to mitigate the security concerns under \nthe guidelines for Personal Conduct, Drug Involvement, and Criminal Conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph  1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline G:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.d: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 4, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 4.a-4.c: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 4.d-4.e: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph, Guideline J: \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 5.a-5.c: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n17 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly in the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted her security clearance application on June 2, 2008 \n(Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP)). On February 12, \n2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to her alleging security concerns under Guideline H (Drug \nInvolvement).1 The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for her, and recommended referral to \n \n1  The SOR was issued pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nWithin Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated \nJanuary 2, 1992, as modified and revised. \n \nAugust 28, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nan administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, \ndenied, or revoked. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR (Answer) on March 4, 2009, and requested to have \nher case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On March 25, 2009, the \ngovernment requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on April 22, 2009. \nDOHA issued the notice of hearing on May 1, 2009. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled on May 15, 2009. The government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which \nwere admitted without objection (Tr. 17). Applicant testified on her own behalf, and \npresented no other evidence. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on May \n27, 2009.  \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nApplicant received constructive notice of her hearing date on April 27, 2009. On \nthat date, Applicant agreed with department counsel to have her hearing scheduled for \nMay 15, 2009. At her hearing, Applicant indicated she had sufficient time to prepare for \nher hearing and that she was ready to proceed. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations. Her admissions are incorporated \nherein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of all evidence of record, and having \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I make the following additional findings \nof fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old administrative assistant working for a defense \ncontractor. She attended college and received her associate\u2019s degree in business in \nDecember 1979. She has continued taking college courses whenever her schedule \npermits. She married her husband in August 1989, and they were divorced in June \n2001. She has two adopted children, a daughter aged 20, and a son, aged 18.  \n \nWhile in high school and in college, between 1974 and August 1979, Applicant \nillegally used marijuana approximately once every month (Tr. 25-26). Between 1979 \nand 2000, Applicant did not use marijuana. She moved away from her marijuana-using \nfriends, began dating and decided that using marijuana was no longer part of her life.  \n \nIn 1999 and 2000, Applicant travelled to Europe on business. On both occasions, \nshe and some co-workers (friends) took time off during two weekends and traveled to \nthe Netherlands to \u201clegally\u201d smoke marijuana (Tr. 32-34). She smoked marijuana once \nin 1999 and once in 2000. In 2001, Applicant illegally ordered marijuana seeds from the \nNetherlands through the U.S. Postal Service. During approximately seven months, she \ngrew marijuana plants in her home basement. She then harvested the marijuana and \nstored it in plastic bags.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant grew the marijuana for her personal consumption. Between 2001 and \n2004, Applicant illegally used marijuana approximately 21 days out of 30 days a month \n(Tr. 35-37, 67). She shared her marijuana with her friends. In particular, she shared the \nmarijuana frequently with a female friend who rented Applicant\u2019s basement apartment \nwhile she was growing the marijuana plants. Between 2001 and 2004, Applicant \nbecame marijuana dependent (Tr. 59). \n \nApplicant explained that after her return from the Netherlands she went through a \nvery difficult period in her life. She was laid off her job six months after her trip, her \nhusband filed for divorce, she became a single parent, and she could no longer have an \nau pair to assist her with her children\u2019s care. She used marijuana to cope with her \nproblems. \n \nIn 2004, Applicant stopped using marijuana \u201ccold turkey\u201d (Tr. 38). She stopped \nusing marijuana because she realized she had developed dependence on marijuana \nand was having trouble controlling her urge to use marijuana. When she smoked \nmarijuana she no longer liked the way it was affecting her and the way it made her feel \n(sluggish, drowsy, and tired). Also, she was concerned that being under the influence \nrestricted her from driving and taking care of her children (Tr. 34). Moreover, she did not \nlike her own attitude towards her children. She was aware that she was placing herself \nin an inappropriate position and her illegal use of marijuana showed a lack of judgment. \nApplicant did not use marijuana between 2004 and July 2007.  \n \nIn July 2007, Applicant attended a party with around 30 of her friends. After the \nparty, she smoked marijuana with six of her friends because of peer pressure (Tr. 44-\n45). She was 47 years old. Applicant acknowledged that by using marijuana she \ndemonstrated poor judgment. At the time, she was working for a company that required \nher to take a drug test as a condition of employment. The company also had a policy \nagainst the use of illegal drugs. In January 2008, Applicant used marijuana twice. She \nused marijuana while dating someone she had been romantically involved with before \n(Tr. 45-47).  \n \nApplicant testified she has not used marijuana since January 2008. She has \nnever participated in any drug rehabilitation treatment or counseling (Tr. 59). Applicant \nbelieves she does not need the drug counseling. She believes she is doing all the right \nthings and that she is capable of doing what she needs to do without professional help \n(Tr. 82). Applicant is undergoing psychiatric treatment and takes medication for mood \nstabilization issues not related to her marijuana abuse (Tr. 80). She believes that her \ndrug abuse was, in part, due to her suffering from depression. She used the marijuana \nto cope with her depression. She believes that taking anti-depression medication helps \nher to remain abstinent. \n \nApplicant stopped using illegal drugs because of concerns with her current job \nand because she wants to ensure her own medical and psychological health (Tr. 81). \nShe has made some lifestyle and behavioral changes to stay abstinent. \nNotwithstanding, Applicant is still in contact with some of the friends with whom she \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                     \nused marijuana between 2001 and 2004. She still has frequent contact with the friend \nwho rented her basement apartment during 2001-2004. They talk to each other once a \nmonth. \n \nApplicant was hired by a government contractor in May 2008. Pursuant to her \nemployment, in June 2008, she submitted a security clearance application in which she \ndisclosed her history of marijuana use. During a follow up interview by a government \ninvestigator and in DOHA interrogatories, Applicant confirmed her use of marijuana. At \nher hearing, Applicant was candid and promptly answered any and all questions about \nthe circumstances surrounding her use of marijuana. All of the information the \ngovernment has concerning Applicant\u2019s use of drugs was disclosed by her. Applicant \nexpressed remorse for her past use of marijuana. She acknowledged that her actions \nreflect bad judgment. She noted that she has not used marijuana since January 2008. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.2 \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s adjudicative goal is \na fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process \nis a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person \nconcept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d3 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \n \n \n2  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n3  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nrug \nparaphernalia.\u201d  \nand became marijuana dependent. Applicant did not use marijuana between 2004 and \n                                                     \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by department counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the government\u2019s security concern about drug involvement: \n \nuse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 provides eight drug involvement conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Two drug involvement disqualifying conditions raise \na security concern and may be disqualifying in this particular case: AG \u00b6 25(a): \u201cany \ndrug abuse;\u201d4 and AG \u00b6 25(b): \u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of d\n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(b) apply. Applicant used marijuana infrequently during high \nschool and college. She used marijuana in the Netherlands in 1999 and 2000. In 2001, \nshe ordered marijuana seeds from the Netherlands using the U.S. Postal System. She \nthen grew the marijuana in her basement. She cultivated the marijuana for her personal \nuse and shared it with friends. She extensively used marijuana between 2001 and 2004, \n \n4  AG \u00b6 24(b) defines \u201cdrug abuse\u201d as \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner \nthat deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n2007. She used marijuana again once in 2007 and twice in 2008. The other \ndisqualifying conditions listed in AG \u00b6 25 are not applicable.  \n \nApplicant disclosed her illegal marijuana use on her 2008 security clearance \napplication, to a government investigator during a subsequent interview, and at her \nhearing. She used illegal drugs infrequently during high school and college. She then \nused marijuana between 2001 and 2004, to cope with her personal and psychological \nproblems. She used marijuana in 2007 and 2008 because of peer pressure. She \nillegally possessed marijuana before she used it, and she cultivated marijuana.  \n  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 26 provides four potentially applicable drug involvement mitigating \nconditions:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance \nfor any violation. \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n \nConsidering the record as a whole, I find that none of the mitigating conditions \napply. Between 2001 and 2004, Applicant used marijuana heavily and developed \ndependence on the drug. At the time, Applicant was a mature woman and fully \nunderstood the adverse legal, mental, and health consequences of her use of \nmarijuana. Applicant stopped using marijuana between 2004 and 2007, because she \nrealized she was becoming marijuana dependent, and her drug use was adversely \naffecting her health and lifestyle. Notwithstanding, she again used marijuana in 2007 \nand 2008.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s last use of marijuana was in January 2008, and, as such, it is recent. \nConsidering the record as a whole, I find that her questionable behavior did not happen \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur. She has not disassociated from her \ndrug-using friends and that continues to cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nThe evidence against approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance includes her use of \nmarijuana while in high school and college, her extensive use of marijuana between \n2001 and 2004, and her recent use of marijuana in 2007 and in 2008. Although \nApplicant seems to be making some lifestyle changes, she has not completely \ndisassociated herself from her marijuana abusing friends. These contacts led to her \nrelapses.  \n \nThe evidence supporting approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance is less substantial. \nShe has worked for a government contractor since May 2008. She is a valued \nemployee and a good mother. She seems to be taking the right course of action to \nbecome abstinent, and she is seeking professional assistance to control her mood \nproblems.  \n \nShe receives full credit for disclosing her history of illegal drug use on her 2008 \nsecurity clearance application. She candidly discussed her drug use with a government \ninvestigator, in her response to DOHA interrogatories, on her SOR response, and at her \nhearing. She knows the consequences of drug abuse. Because she was candid in the \nsecurity clearance process, in the future \u2013 after a reasonable period of abstinence and \ndrug counseling - she should be able to demonstrate her ability to hold a security \nclearance. On balance, after weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the \n\n \n8 \n \n \nfacts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude that, at this time, \nshe has not mitigated the drug involvement security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJUAN J.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is a 36-year-old man who has been employed as an electronics technician by a defense contractor since February 2008. He was employed outside the defense industry as a mechanic from September 2007 to February 2008, and as a project coordinator from April 2001 to September 2007. He obtained a high school general educational development diploma in 1998. Applicant was married in August 1995. That marriage was ended by divorce in January 2008. One 12-year-old daughter was born of the marriage. Applicant has joint custody of the child with his wife. He is currently engaged to be remarried to another woman. Applicant attributes his financial problems to the dissolution of his marriage and the occurrences that accompanied the break-up of his marriage. His wife apparently became dissatisfied with their marital life because, in her view, Applicant was spending an inordinate amount of time working. They discussed the problem, and Applicant quit the job he had been working at for about six years and took a significantly lower paying job to spend more time at home. Despite this effort to save their marriage, Applicant\u2019s wife moved out of the marital residence a few months after he had changed jobs.

However, he failed to mitigate the security concern\nthat still exists due to his ongoing financial problems. \nOn November 21, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.1\nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations) and\nGuideline G (alcohol consumption). Applicant submitted a response to the SOR that was\nreceived by DOHA on December 29, 2008. He admitted all SOR allegations and requested\na hearing.\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nJune 10, 2009\n\n2\nThe case was assigned to me on February 5, 2009. A notice of hearing was issued\non March 5, 2009, scheduling the hearing for April 22, 2009. The hearing was conducted\nas scheduled. The government submitted five documentary exhibits that were marked as\nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1-5 and admitted into the record without objection. Applicant\ntestified and submitted one documentary exhibit that was marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\n(AE) 1 and admitted into the record without objection. The transcript was received on May\n1, 2009.     \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In\naddition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 36-year-old man who has been employed as an electronics technician\nby a defense contractor since February 2008. He was employed outside the defense\nindustry as a mechanic from September 2007 to February 2008, and as a project\ncoordinator from April 2001 to September 2007. He obtained a high school general\neducational development diploma in 1998.\nApplicant was married in August 1995. That marriage was ended by divorce in\nJanuary 2008. One 12-year-old daughter was born of the marriage. Applicant has joint\ncustody of the child with his wife. He is currently engaged to be remarried to another\nwoman.  \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to the dissolution of his marriage and the\noccurrences that accompanied the break-up of his marriage. His wife apparently became\ndissatisfied with their marital life because, in her view, Applicant was spending an\ninordinate amount of time working. They discussed the problem, and Applicant quit the job\nhe had been working at for about six years and took a significantly lower paying job to\nspend more time at home. Despite this effort to save their marriage, Applicant\u2019s wife\nmoved out of the marital residence a few months after he had changed jobs. Further\nexacerbating Applicant\u2019s financial problems, his wife, who had assumed sole responsibility\nfor paying the marital debts, applied virtually all their income to paying only those debts that\nwere solely in her name. \nApplicant testified his income went from somewhere between $45-65,000 annually\nto about $35,000 annually as a result of his change of employment. Additionally, Applicant\nno longer had available the approximately $20,000 his wife had earned annually to apply\nto the debts he became responsible for through the divorce. \nApplicant remained in the marital home and was solely responsible for the home\nmortgage once he and his wife divorced. He provided a somewhat convoluted explanation\nof what happened with the home mortgage. Essentially, the mortgage was sold to a\ncompany which, through an administrative error, expended the funds in Applicant\u2019s escrow\naccount to pay the real estate taxes on someone else\u2019s property. Thereafter, Applicant\u2019s\nmortgage payments were improperly not applied to his account and a foreclosure was\nimminent despite Applicant\u2019s continuing attempts to rectify the problems with the mortgage\n\n3\ncompany. Applicant was able to sell the house before foreclosure but at a price that left\nhim only enough funds to satisfy the mortgage and closing expenses. \nThe account listed in SOR subparagraph 1.a is from a department store credit card\ndebt that was charged off in the amount of $445. Applicant testified he has begun to\nnegotiate with the creditor in an effort to establish a repayment plan. No payment had been\nmade on the account as of the date of the hearing. Applicant\u2019s January 2009 credit bureau\nreport (CBR) indicates this account was reported as transferred or sold in December 2008.\n   \nApplicant testified the account listed in SOR subparagraph 1.b arose from furniture\nhis ex-wife purchased. He believes she should be solely responsible for this account.\nApplicant\u2019s January 2009 CBR indicates this account was reported as charged off and\nclosed by the credit grantor as of December 2008, with a balance of $2,634 still owing.\nApplicant testified he contacted the creditor while working for his previous employer but he\ndid not earn enough money to make the payments required to resolve the account. \nThe account listed in SOR subparagraph 1.c is listed in Applicant\u2019s January 2009\nCBR as a current collection account owing in the past due amount of $2,014.  The $42\nincrease in the amount of this debt from the amount listed in the SOR and Applicant\u2019s\nSeptember 2008 CBR is apparently due to accrued interest. Applicant has not made any\npayments on this account. \nThe account listed in SOR subparagraph 1.d is listed in Applicant\u2019s January 2009\nCBR as a current collection account owing in the past due amount of $4,239. The name\nof the creditor indicates this is a credit card debt.  The $104 increase in the amount of this\ndebt from the amount listed in the SOR and Applicant\u2019s September 2008 CBR is\napparently also due to accrued interest. Applicant has not made any payments on this\naccount. \nApplicant testified the debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.e is a debt owed on a\ntruck that belongs to his ex-wife\u2019s brother. He also testified his brother-in-law is currently\nmaking payments on the loan. Applicant\u2019s September 2008 CBR lists $8,709 as the\namount owing on this account with $233 being past due. Applicant\u2019s January 2009 CBR\nlists $7,479 as the amount owing on this account with $233 still being past due. The $1,230\nreduction in the balance owing on the account corroborates Applicant\u2019s testimony that\npayments are being made on the loan. \nThe account listed in SOR subparagraph 1.f is a debt owed to a credit union in the\ntotal amount of $2,673 that was reported as past due in the amount of $1,490 in\nApplicant\u2019s September 2008 CBR. Applicant\u2019s January 2009 CBR discloses the past due\namount had risen to $2,318 as of December 2008. Applicant testified he had made a\npayment on the account and he submitted AE 1 in verification of the payment having been\nmade. AE 1 is a receipt from a court that discloses a judgment was entered against\nApplicant on this account, that the total amount due as a result of the judgment was\n$3,039.22, and that Applicant made a $100 payment on the judgment on April 7, 2009. \nThe account listed in SOR subparagraph 1.g arose from a four-wheel vehicle\nApplicant had purchased. Applicant thought this vehicle was insured through his home\n\n4\nowner\u2019s insurance policy. However, when the vehicle was stolen from his house the\ninsurance company refused to pay for the loss. The creditor then demanded full payment\non the outstanding balance owing in the amount of $5,589 due to the loss of the collateral.\nApplicant has not made any payment on this loan since the vehicle was stolen. Applicant\u2019s\nJanuary 2009 CBR discloses this account was reported as charged off as of January 2008.\nApplicant obtained a loan in the amount of $15,000 from his sister and brother-in-\nlaw to purchase an apparently run down house that he plans to repair and sell. He currently\nis working on various projects in the house in his spare time. Once he has completed the\nnecessary repairs, Applicant plans to sell the house and use the proceeds to satisfy his\ndelinquent creditors. \nApplicant resides with his mother and pays about $450 a month for groceries and\nother household expenses. After paying his other recurring monthly expenses, Applicant\nhas about $84 left from his wages. However, he also claims he is paying $400 per month\non the loan from his sister and brother-in-law and $200 on a credit union loan. He\nexplained he obtains the money to make the loan payments by picking up odd jobs when\nhe can and by \u201crob(bing) Peter to pay Paul\u201d (Tr. 66) when he can\u2019t. \nApplicant was arrested on January 3, 2008, and charged with driving under the\ninfluence (DUI) and resisting arrest. Applicant\u2019s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was\n0.08 at the time of his arrest. He only went to trial on the DUI charge (apparently the\nresisting arrest charge was dropped as part of a pretrial negotiation that required him to\nwaive his right to a jury trial).  Applicant was convicted of DUI and sentenced to serve five\ndays in jail, pay about $400 in fines, and attend an alcohol abuse awareness class. \nApplicant wrote a lengthy explanation about the arrest and conviction as part of his\nresponse to the SOR. He had consumed a couple of beers with his mother and others and\nthen went with his fiance to a residence where they were to attend a social gathering and\nspend the night. No one was home when they arrived at the location. Applicant and his\nfiance sat in his car in the driveway to the house and consumed a small amount of alcohol\nthey had brought with them while waiting for others to arrive. Police officers arrested him\nas he and his fiance were sitting in the car in the driveway. Applicant credibly testified he\ndid not resist arrest. \nApplicant was questioned at length about his history of alcohol consumption at the\nhearing. He first consumed alcohol when he was about 19 years old. His description of his\nalcohol use since that time is consistent with that of what is commonly referred to as a\nsocial drinker. He denies ever driving an automobile when he has consumed anything\nmore than a very small amount of alcohol.         \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n2\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n3\n Department of the Navy v. Egan 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n4\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (December 19, 2002) at p. 3 (citations omitted).\n5\n ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 2.\n6\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at pp. 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n7\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n8\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n9\n Id. at 531.\n10\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n11\n5\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F (financial\nconsiderations) and Guideline G (alcohol consumption), with their disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions, are most relevant in this case. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n2\n3\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,4\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n5\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n6\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n7\nclearance decision.8\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n9\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n10\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n11\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\n\n  Although not alleged in the SOR, the existence of this newly listed account is probative of the\n12\napplication of mitigating conditions.\n6\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .\n(Adjudicative Guideline [AG] 18)\nInformation contained in Applicant\u2019s September 2008 and January 2009 CBRs\ncorroborate his testimony that the account alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.e is based on\na truck loan on which his brother-in-law is making regular payments. That subparagraph\nis decided for Applicant.  \nApplicant has made only one $100 payment on any of the other debts alleged in the\nSOR. That payment was only made after a judgment had been entered against him for that\ndebt. With that payment, Applicant still owes $17,860.22 on the six accounts alleged in the\nSOR. Those accounts have either charged off, submitted for collection, listed as seriously\npast due or have resulted in a judgment being entered against Applicant. Disqualifying\nConditions (DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and DC 19(c): a history\nof not meeting financial obligations apply.\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems arose from the dissolution of his marriage and the\nfinancial problems he experienced as a result thereof. Those problems included a\nsignificant reduction in his income and his ex-wife using their joint funds to solely pay her\ndebts in anticipation of their divorce. Applicant\u2019s financial problems were exacerbated by\nthe misapplication of money from his home mortgage escrow account to pay someone\nelse\u2019s property taxes and the need to thereafter sell his home for less than he might\notherwise have been able to obtain to prevent a foreclosure. \nHowever, Applicant has done virtually nothing to resolve his lingering financial\nproblems. He has not sought credit counseling in an effort to bring his financial problems\nunder control, nor has he made any meaningful effort to resolve any delinquent accounts.\nThese factors preclude finding that Applicant has acted responsibly since his financial\nproblems began.  \nAlso, Applicant failed to present any probative evidence to establish that his goal of\nremodelling the house he is currently working on will actually provide him with funds to\napply to his delinquent debts. Also troubling is that his January 2009 CBR discloses a utility\nbill owing in the amount of $396 that was just listed as having been submitted for collection\nin October 2008.  \n12\nAs a result of the above, I conclude Mitigating Condition (MC) 20(a): the behavior\n. . . occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; MC 20(b): the\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control\n(e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a\ndeath, divorce or separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\nMC 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there\n\n7\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control; and MC 20(d):\nthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts do not apply.  \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nParagraph 21: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. (Adjudicative Guideline [AG] 21)\nApplicant\u2019s arrest and conviction for DUI is an aberration in his otherwise law abiding\nlife. There is no evidence to indicate he ever before abused alcohol. Indeed, his testimony\non the subject establishes he is properly categorized as no more than a social drinker. DC\n22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence,\nfighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern,\nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent applies. However, that disqualifying condition is overwhelming outweighed by\napplication of MC 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or\nit happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.   \nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\ntheir acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and\nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has mitigated the\nalcohol consumption security concern but he has failed to mitigate the financial\nconsiderations security concern. He has not overcome the case against him nor has he\nsatisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion in regard to the financial considerations security\nconcern. It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security\nclearance. Guideline G is decided for Applicant. Guideline F is decided against Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.f & 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nParagraph 2, Guideline G:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion               \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the single SOR allegation. His admission is incorporated herein as a finding of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence of record, and having considered Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 30-year-old executive assistant to the chief executive officer (CEO) of a large defense contractor. He is single and has no children. While in high school, Applicant accepted a Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) college scholarship. In his junior year of college, Applicant failed his physical training test and was dismissed from the ROTC program. He lost his scholarship and had to transfer to a university he could afford. Applicant worked through college and took student loans to pay for his education. Applicant\u2019s ROTC scholarship debt, approximately $27,981, became due as soon as he was dismissed from the ROTC program. Although he worked part-time while attending college, Applicant\u2019s income was not sufficient to pay his ROTC obligation and cover his day-to-day living expenses. Applicant stayed in contact with the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) and several times attempted to establish a payment plan. The DFAS\u2019 collection agency required Applicant to pay a minimum of $1,000 a month to establish a viable payment plan. Applicant failed to repay his ROTC debt because, as a student, he did not have the financial means to do so. Applicant graduated from college in December ",

Although he worked part-time while \nattending college, Applicant\u2019s income was not sufficient to pay his ROTC obligation and \ncover his day-to-day living expenses. Applicant stayed in contact with the Defense \nFinance and Accounting Service (DFAS) and several times attempted to establish a \npayment plan. The DFAS\u2019 collection agency required Applicant to pay a minimum of \n$1,000 a month to establish a viable payment plan. Applicant failed to repay his ROTC \ndebt because, as a student, he did not have the financial means to do so.  \n \nApplicant graduated from college in December 2003. He started working shortly \nthereafter at an hourly rate of $8.50. When he left that job in 2005, he was making \n$10.50 an hour. Between 2005 and 2007, Applicant studied for his master\u2019s degree in \npublic policy. At the same time, he was working part-time as a receptionist for his \ncurrent employer, a government contractor. He was making $10 an hour.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant received his master\u2019s degree in May 2007. He then started working full-\ntime for his current employer at a yearly salary of $36,000 ($18 an hour) - $42,000 with \novertime. After he started working full-time, Applicant again attempted to establish a \npayment plan with DFAS; however, the DFAS\u2019 collection agency would not accept \npayments bellow $800 a month. Applicant could not afford those terms.  \n \nWhile in college and during the graduate program, Applicant also took other \nstudent loans to pay for his education. When he started working full-time, Applicant \nconsolidated all his student loans and started making payments on them. Thereafter, he \nhas consistently paid his student loans on time and has not been in default. He was not \nallowed to consolidate his DFAS debt with his other student loans. Applicant started to \nsave money to pay his DFAS obligation. \n \nApplicant has been working as the executive assistant to the CEO and Chairman \nof the Board of his company since 2007. He is considered to be a bright young man with \na promising career. He is also considered to be honest, trustworthy, and loyal to the \nUnited States. In the CEO\u2019s opinion, Applicant has absolute integrity and is a \nhardworking valuable citizen. He strongly recommended that Applicant receive a \nsecurity clearance (AE 6).  \n \nApplicant discussed with his CEO his financial problems and the SOR allegation. \nBecause of Applicant\u2019s job performance and his promising future, the CEO gave \nApplicant $10,000 as a gift. He also extended Applicant a $14,702 loan so that \nApplicant could pay his debt to DFAS. In June 2009, Applicant paid his debt to DFAS \n(AE 2). Applicant signed a promissory note agreeing to repay the $14,702 loan to his \ncompany by making $400 monthly payments (AE 3). He is current and in compliance \nwith the terms of his loan (AE 5).  \n \nApplicant owes approximately $80,000 between his student loans and his debt to \nhis company. A review of Applicant\u2019s personal financial statement (AE 1) and credit \nreport (GE 2) shows that he is in control of his financial situation, and that he is not \nfinancially overextended. There is no evidence of any additional delinquent and/or \ncharged off debts. Applicant appears to be living within his financial means. Moreover, \nhe has established a viable plan to pay his legal obligations and is taking significant \nactions to implement his plan. \n \nApplicant expressed remorse for his failure to complete the ROTC program and \nfor his subsequent inability to pay his financial obligation on time. He was candid and \nforthcoming explaining the circumstances surrounding his ROTC debt and his financial \nsituation. Applicant has learned his lesson through the security clearance process. He is \nnow well aware of what is required of him to show that he is reliable, trustworthy, and \nfinancially responsible.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d1 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by department counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \ngovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \n \n1  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the security concern is that failure or inability to live within \none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having \nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \nIn 2002, Applicant was discharged from the ROTC program because he failed his \nphysical training test. His ROTC scholarship debt became due immediately. At the time, \nhe was a full-time student and worked part-time. He did not have the financial means to \npay his ROTC debt and his day-to-day living expenses. He paid his ROTC debt in June \n2009, with the generous financial assistance of his employer. AG \u00b6 19(a): inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts; and AG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial \nobligations, apply in this case.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n \nI find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (c), and (d) apply. Applicant intended to comply with his \nROTC commitment, and he wanted to receive an officer commission. He claimed he \nfailed his physical training test during his junior year for reasons beyond his control. \nApplicant\u2019s ROTC scholarship debt became due as soon as he was dismissed from the \nROTC program. At the time, Applicant\u2019s income was not sufficient to pay his ROTC \nobligation and cover his day-to-day living expenses. Applicant maintained contact with \nDFAS, and several times attempted to establish a payment plan.  \n \nApplicant started working full-time after completing his master\u2019s degree in 2007. \nHe consolidated his student loans and started making payments on them. Thereafter, \nhe has consistently paid his student loans on time and has not been in default. He also \nattempted to consolidate his debt to DFAS with his other student loans and he was not \nallowed to do so. Applicant paid his debt to DFAS with the financial assistance of his \nemployer. He owes approximately $80,000 between his student loans and his debt to \nhis employer. Notwithstanding his large debt, Applicant is in control of his financial \nsituation, and he does not appear to be financially overextended. He has no additional \ndelinquent and/or charged off debts. Applicant appears to be living within his financial \nmeans. \n \n \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, I find Applicant\u2019s financial problems \noccurred under such circumstances that they are unlikely to recur. His past \nquestionable behavior does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. Applicant\u2019s consolidation and payment of his student loans, his \notherwise good credit, and his payment record to his employer show good-faith effort to \nrepay his creditors.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n7 \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature, well educated \nman with outstanding potential. He has been successful working for a defense \ncontractor since 2005. He has established a reputation as a valuable, dedicated, and \nreliable employee. His supervisors consider him to be honest, trustworthy, and \ndependable. There is no evidence he has ever compromised classified information or \ncommitted any security violations. Applicant expressed sincere remorse for his financial \nproblem and seems resolute on fixing it. These factors show responsibility, good \njudgment, and mitigation. \n \nOn balance, I conclude Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence is sufficient to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns. Applicant\u2019s four-year performance for a government contractor, and \nhis efforts to resolve his financial problems show reliability, judgment, and willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. He has a stable job. Moreover, he has established a \nviable plan to pay his legal obligations and is taking significant actions to implement his \nplan. Applicant has learned from his past mistakes and, in the future, he will be able to \nlive within his financial means. Overall, the record evidence convinces me of Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant:\nPro se\nAugust 13, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nThe Applicant submitted his Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF86),\non May 29, 2008 (Government Exhibit 1). On February 19, 2009, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant,\nwhich detailed security concerns under Guidelines F, J, and E stating why DOHA could\nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether\na clearance should be denied or revoked. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by President Bush on December 29,\n\n2\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \n \nThe Applicant answered the SOR in writing on March 16, 2009, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\non March 30, 2009. The case was assigned to another administrative judge on April 2,\n2009. This case was reassigned to me on April 6, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of\nhearing on April 6, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 28, 2009.\nThe Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 8, which were received without\nobjection. The Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A\nthrough C, also without objection.  The record was left open at the Applicant\u2019s request\nfor the submission of additional documentation.  The Applicant submitted Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit D on May 22, 2009. This exhibit was also received without objection.  DOHA\nreceived the transcript of the hearing on May 13, 2009.  The record closed on May 22,\n2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 46 and divorced. He is employed by a defense contractor and\nseeks a security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense industry.\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in the SOR, with\nthe exception of subparagraph 1.e. Those admissions are hereby deemed findings of\nfact. He also provided explanations with his responses.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he in financially overextended and therefore at risk of engaging in\nillegal acts to obtain funds.\n1.a.  The Applicant admits that he is indebted to a collection agency in the\namount of $205 for a returned check. The Applicant sent a letter to the creditor in\nOctober 2008 to determine how he could pay this debt. He had not heard from them as\nof the date of the hearing.  He has obtained other contact information and intends to pay\nthis debt as soon as possible. (Transcript at 45-46; Applicant\u2019s Answer at 1.)\n1.b.  The Applicant admits that he owed a jaywalking ticket in the amount of $85.\nThe debt was paid in April 2009.  (Transcript at 46-47; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.) \n1.c.  The Applicant admits that he owes a medical bill in the amount of $614. The\nApplicant testified that the first time he knew he owed this debt was October 2008, when\nhe obtained a credit report.  He stated that he had insurance at the time this debt was\nincurred and believed all of his medical expenses were covered. He intends to pay this\nbill quickly.  (Transcript at 48-49; Applicant\u2019s Answer at 1.)\n\n3\n1.d.\nThe Applicant admits that he owes a medical bill in the amount of $297.\nThe Applicant testified that the first time he knew he owed this debt was October 2008,\nwhen he obtained a credit report.  He stated that he had insurance at the time this debt\nwas incurred and believed all of his medical expenses were covered. He intends to pay\nthis bill quickly.  (Transcript at 48-49; Applicant\u2019s Answer at 1.)\n1.e.\nThe Applicant denied that he owes $649 for a past due credit card bill. The\nApplicant presented documentary evidence that he paid this debt in August 2008. The\nGovernment\u2019s latest credit report confirms that this debt has been paid. (Transcript at\n44-45; Government Exhibit 2 at 14, and Exhibit 7at 2.) \nThe Applicant testified that his financial situation was severely impacted by the\nincident described below under subparagraph 2.a. (Transcript at 44.) The Applicant was\naccused of a crime and, because he could not make bail, spent seven months in pre-\ntrial confinement. He was acquitted of the charge at trial.  \nIn addition to the debts in the SOR, which he has recently paid, the Applicant\nprovided documentary evidence showing that he has also paid the State almost $4,000\nto clear various driving fines on his record.  The Applicant stated that his priorities were\ntaking care of his past due credit card bill and the courts.  (Transcript at 45; Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit C.)\nParagraph 2 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has engaged in criminal acts, which call into question the\nApplicant\u2019s ability to comply with rules, laws and regulations. In order to provide a\nworkable context to the allegations they will be discussed in chronological order, rather\nthan the order they are alleged in the SOR.\n2.k.\nIn 1981, when he was 18 years old, the Applicant was involved in a fight in\nState A with a person to whom he had lent money. While chasing this person, the\nApplicant hit and broke a door. He was charged with Breaking and Entering and spent\ntwo months in pre-trial confinement because he could not afford the bail. He pled guilty\nand received credit for time served. He was also awarded two years probation and\nfined. (Transcript at 24-26; Government Exhibit 2 at 7-8.)\n2.j.\nThe Applicant\u2019s next arrest occurred in October 1993. The Applicant had\nmoved to State B, where he still lives. The Applicant had bought a double edged knife at\nthe flea market.  Such knives are illegal in State B. During a traffic stop the police found\nthe knife and confiscated it. He was charged with Carrying a Deadly Weapon. The\nApplicant did not appear in court until 1995. At that time he was charged with Criminal\nContempt of Court and forfeited his $50 bail. The underlying charge was dismissed.\nBoth charges were misdemeanors. (Transcript at 27-28; Government Exhibit 2 at 8, and\nExhibit 3 at 6-7.)\n\n4\n2.i.\nThe Applicant has no current memory of a Criminal Contempt of Court\ncitation in December 1993. For this misdemeanor he was sentenced to pay a $25 fine.\n(Transcript at 28-29; Government Exhibit 3 at 5-6.)\n2.h.\nThe Applicant was arrested in December 1993 as the result of a fight that\nhe got into with his now ex-wife. During an argument he threatened her, hit her truck\nwith a hammer, and then drove the truck away to try and get it fixed. When he returned\nhe was arrested and charged with Making a Terrorist Threat, Criminal Property Damage\nand Unlawful Control of a Powered Vehicle. He was found guilty and served 57 days in\njail, five years probation, required to take a mental health assessment and pay\nrestitution. He successfully completed all the terms of his sentence. (Transcript at 29-\n33; Government Exhibit 3 at 5-6.)\n2.g.\nThe Applicant has no current memory of a Criminal Contempt of Court\ncitation in January 1995.  This misdemeanor charge was dismissed.  (Transcript at 33-\n34; Government Exhibit 3 at 4.)\n2.f.\nThe Applicant testified that he cannot remember the particulars of a\ncharge of Abusing a Family Member in January 1995.  The police records state that the\ndisposition is unavailable. In his Answer, the Applicant stated that he believes the\ncharges were dismissed. (Transcript at 34; Government Exhibit 3 at 4; Applicant\u2019s\nAnswer at 3.)\n2.e.\nThe Applicant testified, and stated in his Answer, that he has no current\nknowledge of a Criminal Contempt of Court charge in February 2001. This\nmisdemeanor charge was nolle prosequi by State B authorities. (Transcript at 34-35;\nGovernment Exhibit 3 at 4; Applicant\u2019s Answer at 3.)\n2.d.\nThe events in subparagraphs 2.d., 2.b. and 2.a. all concern the same\nperson. This was a woman (Miss One) that the Applicant became involved with who,\nafter a period of time, began stalking the Applicant. On May 21, 2005, she had the\nApplicant arrested for Abuse of a Family Member and Criminal Property Damage. The\nApplicant could not make bail and spent 23 days in jail. The charges were dismissed\nwithout prejudice on June 13, 2005. The Applicant obtained an Order For Protection\nagainst Miss One on June 29, 2005. This Order continues in effect to this day.\n(Transcript at 35-38; Government Exhibit 2 at 8; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D at 4-11.)\n2.c.\nThe Applicant was arrested in August 2005 for Unauthorized Control of a\nPropelled Vehicle. According to the Applicant, he was involved in a dispute with a\nformer employer that involved a vehicle. The Applicant was discharged by the police\npending further investigation. There is no evidence the case ever went to court.\n(Transcript at 39-40; Government Exhibit 3 at 3.)\n2.b.\nThe Applicant ran into Miss One in January 2006. He saw that she needed\nhelp, so he bought some groceries and other items for her at a grocery store.\nAccording to the Applicant, while at a drug store, she put stolen items into a bag he was\n\n5\ncarrying.  He was stopped by store security, arrested and charged with Petty Theft.\n(Government Exhibit 2 at 8-9; Government Exhibit 3 at 2.) This incident is not alleged in\nthe SOR, but is connected to the incident alleged in subparagraph 2.b.  \nSubparagraph 2.b. states that, in May 2006, Miss One accused the Applicant of\nassaulting her and stealing her cell phone. He was charged with Petty Theft, Abuse of a\nFamily Member and Criminal Contempt of Court. As part of a plea bargain, he plead\nguilty to the two misdemeanor counts of Petty Theft and the other charges were\ndismissed. The Applicant states that, in retrospect, it was a mistake to plead guilty to\nsomething he did not do. (Transcript at 40-41; Government Exhibit 2 at 9; Exhibit 3 at 2-\n3.)\n2.a.\nThe Applicant was arrested for allegedly assaulting Miss One on August\n23, 2007. She claimed that the Applicant threw her off of a cliff. As stated earlier, the\nApplicant could not make bail and spent seven months in pre-trial confinement. The\nApplicant\u2019s lawyer submitted a letter describing the mental problems of Miss One and\nstated, \u201cAfter 7 months of preparation for trial and 1 week of testimony in a jury trial, it\ntook the jury less than 30 minutes in rejecting [Miss One\u2019s] claims and finding [the\nApplicant] not guilty.\u201d The acquittal occurred on March 17, 2008. The Applicant\u2019s ex-wife\nalso confirms the attorney\u2019s statements. (Transcript at 41-42, 68-72; Government\nExhibit 2 at 9-10, Exhibit 3 at 1-2; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D at 12-13.)  \nParagraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has made false statements to the Department of Defense during\nthe clearance screening process.\n3.a.\nThe Applicant started work for his current employer in May 2008. He filled\nout an SF86 the same month.  (Government Exhibit 1.)  Question 23.a. asks whether\nthe Applicant had ever been charged or convicted of any felony offense.  He answered\n\u201cNo.\u201d This answer was false, as described above. \n3.b.\nQuestion 23.f. of Government Exhibit 1 asks the Applicant whether, in the\nlast seven years, he had been arrested, charged with or convicted of any offense not\nlisted elsewhere on the form.  He answered \u201cNo.\u201d  This answer was also false, as\ndescribed above.\n3.c.\nThe Government also alleges that the facts stated in Paragraph 2 above,\nhave separate security significance under this Guideline as well.  \nThe Applicant testified at length on the falsification issue. He did not attempt to\nminimize his falsification in any way.  Rather, he stated that he had been declined\nemployment close to 100 times because of his record.  He stated that he felt if he could\nget his foot in the door he could show his employer what he could do.  According to the\nApplicant, he fully expected his employer or the Government to do a criminal\n\n6\nbackground check and he would have to explain himself. He testified that his employer\nknows all about his criminal history background and his lying on the questionnaire and\nstill wants him to work for them. The Applicant further testified that he realizes his\ndecision to falsify his SF86 was a mistake. Finally, the Applicant credibly testified that\nhe would always be truthful in the future. (Transcript at 52-56.)\nMitigation\nThe Applicant\u2019s supervisor submitted letters on the Applicant\u2019s behalf.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A and Exhibit D at 2-3.)  She states that the Applicant is a \u201cvery\nreliable and trustworthy person, on and off the job.\u201d\nThe Applicant\u2019s ex-wife also submitted a letter.  She says, \u201cHe [the Applicant]\nnever misses work and very much enjoys what he [is] doing.  He is very proud of his job\nand feels like what he does makes a difference not only for [him] self but other\npeople[\u2018s] lives.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D at 12.)\nThe Applicant\u2019s attorney for the allegation in 2.a. submitted a letter where he\nstates, \u201cDuring the 7 months that I worked with [the Applicant], I found him to be a very\nkind and respectful gentle man. He was a very intelligent, calm, rational and patient\nindividual. He did not exhibit any signs of hostility or irrational behavior. Without any\nreservations, I would recommend [the Applicant] for employment.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\nD at 13.)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n\n7\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.\nIn this case, the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial\nevidence that the Applicant had financial difficulties (Guideline F), has engaged in\ncriminal conduct (Guideline J), and that the Applicant made false statements in the\nclearance screening process (Guideline E.)  The Applicant, on the other hand, has\nsuccessfully mitigated the Government's case.\n\n8\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:     \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise\nsecurity concerns.  The Applicant failed to pay several of his debts for a period of years.\nThe evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a\ncloser examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties.  Mitigating Condition \u00b6 20(a) states that the\ndisqualifying conditions may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago,\nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness or good\njudgment.  As described above, the Applicant\u2019s seven month pre-trial confinement for a\ncrime he did not do was detrimental to the Applicant\u2019s ability to pay his debts.  Since his\nacquittal, he has paid over $4,000 to resolve several of his past due debts.   \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(b), the disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where the\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment . . .), and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances.  The Applicant was not earning income during the time he was\nwrongfully incarcerated. As soon as he was released from jail and employed, he began\nto pay his bills. \nEvidence that the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts is also mitigating under \u00b6 20(d).  The Applicant showed that\nhe has successfully paid off two of the debts alleged in the SOR, in addition to showing\na credible intent to pay his remaining debts.  I conclude this potentially mitigating\ncondition applies.\nThe Applicant has successfully mitigated the security concerns of this allegation.\nParagraph 1 is found for the Applicant.\n\n9\nParagraph 2 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct)\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in\nAG & 30:      \nCriminal activity creates doubts about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nThe Applicant was allegedly involved in criminal incidents from 1981 to 2007.  AG\n\u00b6 31(a) applies to this case, stating that a disqualifying condition is a single serious\ncrime or multiple lesser offenses.  In addition, AG \u00b6 31(d) also applies, which states that\na disqualifying condition is an allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of\nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \nThe Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct can be divided into two distinct periods.  The\nfirst, from 1981 through 1995, occurred when the Applicant was a young man.  (SOR\nsubparagraphs 2.f. through 2.k.) All of these events took place over 13 years ago.\nSeveral of them involve the Applicant not showing up for court and being found in\ncontempt.  While still important in determining the Applicant\u2019s security worthiness, the\nspan in time must be considered as a mitigating factor.\nThree of the four incidents since 2005 revolve around the relationship of the\nApplicant and Miss One. The Applicant has presented compelling evidence, including a\nletter from his lawyer, that he was the subject of a stalker for several years. The truth of\nthis event is shown by the fact that, after seven months in pre-trial confinement and a\nweek long jury trial, he was acquitted in less than 30 minutes. The other incident (2.c.)\ncan be explained as a conflict between employer and employee. Of importance is the\nfact that no court case ever occurred because of the incident in 2.c.  \nThe Applicant\u2019s credible testimonial evidence is that he has learned his lesson\nfrom these incidents and they will not be repeated.  In determining his credibility, I\nspecifically considered all of the SOR allegations, and his admission that he falsified his\nSF86.  He showed a mature grasp of what happened here, why, and how to avoid such\nincidents in the future.  He is not the same person who got into trouble.  \nUnder the particular facts of this case, several of the mitigating conditions also\napply and justify a finding for the Applicant as to this Guideline.  They are AG \u00b6 32(a ),\nso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under\nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment; and AG \u00b6 32(b), there is\nevidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time\nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher\neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement. Upon\ncursory review, the Applicant\u2019s criminal history may be troubling, but a closer inspection\nshows that he has mitigated the concerns.  Paragraph 2 is found for the Applicant.\n\nSuch a conclusion finds support in DOHA/DISCR Appeal Board precedent.  See DISCR OSD Case No. 88-\n1\n2635 (Ap. Bd. January 19, 1990).\n10\nParagraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG & 15:      \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 16(a), the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, is potentially disqualifying. The Applicant did\nprovide false information on his questionnaire concerning his criminal history. Such\nfalsifications normally result in an Applicant being denied a security clearance. I find that\nsuch a result is not justified in this case.  \nAs described at length above, the Applicant had been released from jail after\nspending seven months there for a crime he did not commit. He needed to get back to\nwork.  Telling prospective employers the truth about his criminal history resulted in his\nbeing turned down many times. In order to get the job he now holds, the Applicant made\nthe regrettable decision to lie about his criminal history. He credibly testified that the\nsituation was desperate and that he would not make the same mistake again. He states\nthat his employer is completely knowledgeable of the falsification and his criminal\nrecord, and still wants him to be an employee.\nThis is such a compelling case, based on the singular situation found here, I find\nthat the Applicant meets the requirements of AG \u00b6 17(c).  This condition states that it\ncan be mitigating where the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the\nbehavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it\nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment.  (Emphasis supplied.) Human beings, and not just the Applicant,\n1\nmake mistakes.  There is no denying this is a serious mistake.  Yet, taking all of the\nevidence into account, considering all the circumstances of this particular case, I find\nthat his conduct can be mitigated.  \nI have also separately considered the Paragraph 2 allegations under this\nGuideline. AG \u00b6 16(c) sets forth the applicable disqualifying condition: credible adverse\ninformation in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse\ndetermination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole,\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\n\n11\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected\ninformation. However, based on all the available evidence, I find that Mitigating\nCondition AG \u00b6 17(d) applies: the individual has acknowledged the behavior and\nobtained counseling to change the behavior or taken positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other\ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.  It became obvious during\nthe hearing, and is supported by the letter from his lawyer, that the seven months the\nApplicant spent in jail on a spurious charge have changed him for the better. \nThe Applicant has mitigated all of the subparagraphs under Paragraph 3.\nGuideline E is found for the Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, in particular the Applicant\u2019s criminal\nhistory, his payment of several of his bills since his release, and particularly his\nfalsifications on a Government questionnaire.  Three of the factors have the most\nimpact on this case.  First, I find that there is the \u201cpresence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes,\u201d as set forth under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6).  The\nApplicant has shown that he has truly turned a corner on his life, his financial situation is\nunder control, his falsifications were a unique circumstance not to be repeated, and he\nhas demonstrated reliability and trustworthiness since he began working for his current\nemployer.  I find that he is eligible for a security clearance. Under the particular facts of\nthis case, there is little or no \u201cpotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress\u201d as\nset forth in AG \u00b6 2(a)(8).  Finally, given all the circumstances, I do not find that there is\nthe \u201clikelihood of continuation or recurrence\u201d as discussed in AG \u00b6 2(a)(9) . \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\n\n12\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the Government's Statement of\nReasons.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nFor the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.f.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.g.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.h.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.i.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.j.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.k.:\nFor the Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.c.:\nFor the Applicant\n\n13\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On February 6, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 2, 2009. She requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on April 2,\n2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 15, 2009, and I convened the hearing\nas scheduled on May 13, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1-5, which were\nreceived without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf. She submitted Exhibits\n(AE) A-C which were admitted into the record. I held the record open until May 20, 2009\nMay 29, 2009\n\n2\nfor additional documents that Applicant wished to submit. Applicant submitted\ndocuments, which were marked as AE D-K and admitted into the record without\nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on May 26, 2009. Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated March 2, 2009, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.k and 1.m of the SOR. She denied 1.l because the\naccount was paid. She provided additional information to support her request for\neligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She graduated from\nhigh school in 1987. She has worked for her current employer since April 2008 (GE 1).\nShe first held a security clearance since 1999 (Tr. 16).\nApplicant married in 1992. Her marriage ended in divorce in 2000. Applicant was\nthe sole provider for her two young children after her divorce. She did receive some\nchild support (Tr. 30). Applicant worked and paid for day care for her children. She also\npaid legal bills for a protracted child custody dispute after her separation and divorce\n(Tr. 47). She concentrated on certain bills that she deemed a necessity or priority and\ndepartment store credit bills were not addressed. She admits that she was very\nconcerned about raising her children and surviving on her income (Tr. 15). She\nacknowledges that she has made some bad financial decisions (Tr. 19)\nApplicant had very short periods of unemployment in 2005 (Tr. 52). In 2006, she\nhad a serious medical procedure. This created many medical bills that she could not\nafford to pay (Tr. 31). \nApplicant remarried in 2007. She and her husband have six children in their\ncombined family. Four children currently live in Applicant\u2019s home. She and her husband\ncontribute to the household income (Tr. 29). Her husband has had his income adversely\naffected by the recent economic crisis (AE B).\nThe SOR alleged 8 delinquent debts, including medical bills, and credit card bills.\nApplicant admitted the debts and her credit reports confirmed them (GE 2). The total\namount of delinquent debt was approximately $12,029 (GE 3).\nApplicant contacted credit reporting companies. She discovered that some\naccounts on her credit reports were duplicates. She contacted each creditor and\nresearched the accounts.  She has written letters and is still awaiting changes to be\nnoted on her credit reports (Tr. 24). Her credit reports also show that she has many\naccounts that are \u201cpaid as agreed.\u201d\n\n3\nApplicant presented documentation that she has addressed/paid all the debts in\nSOR \u00b6 1 (GE 4; AE D-J) with the exception of SOR \u00b6 1.a which has been disputed. The\naccount is for an item that her ex-husband owns. They are now attempting to pay it\ntogether through a payment plan (Tr. 33). Applicant has one remaining debt that she\nhas not paid in full (SOR \u00b6 1.i). The account is for a medical bill for which Applicant has\nhad a long dispute with the physician. However, she is now preparing to make payment\narrangements (Tr. 43).\nApplicant\u2019s current net monthly income is $1,800. After her monthly expenses,\nshe has a net remainder of $350. She is current with her bills. She follows a budget.\nShe contacted a credit company to help her research the debts that appeared on her\ncredit reports. She has worked with them and her credit score has increased.\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor describes her as conscientious worker, extremely bright, a\nfast learner and well liked by everyone. She is a fighter and has been the sole provider\nfor her three children for a long time. She works long hours. She is a generous woman\nwho genuinely cares about people. She was raised in a military family and is patriotic.\nShe is no security risk to the nation (AE B).\nApplicant is an aggressive self-starter who provides invaluable planning\nassistance to every project she is assigned. She has insight which has earned her a\nCommander\u2019s Coin for Outstanding Performance (AE D). She received a promotion and\na salary increase after just six months of employment. She is a Team Coordinator and\nhas responsibility for researching and providing subject matter expertise in her field.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\n\n4\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debts on numerous accounts for a\nperiod of almost ten years. She admits that she did not meet her financial obligations\nfrom 2000 until the present. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying\nconditions. \n\n5\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial difficulties were a result of a separation, divorce and medical issues. She tried\nto pay her bills but could not afford to pay all of them. This potentially mitigating\ncondition applies in part. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant\u2019s separation,\ndivorce and emergency medical bills account for her debts. She had short periods of\nunemployment as well. I find this mitigating condition applies. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant paid or resolved the majority of her delinquent\ndebts. She is in the process of making arrangements to pay the last two debts. There\nare clear indications that the problem is under control. I conclude these mitigating\nconditions apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature, intelligent\nwoman. After her separation and divorce, she was a single working mother caring for\nher two young children. She provided for her family and did the best that she could\n\n6\nunder the circumstances. She had some unemployment and a medical issue that\ncreated more bills.\nShe was candid and straightforward at the hearing. She acknowledged that she\nput her children\u2019s needs first and paid bills according to her priorities. She was very\norganized and presented documentation that confirmed she has paid  the debts in the\nSOR with the exception of the two that she disputed. She is now making arrangements\nto pay those using payment plans.\nShe has a very long and very positive work history. She has excellent references.\nShe has received praise and recognition from her current employer. She has held a\nsecurity clearance during her career and understands the importance of security\nresponsibilities.\n  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nFor Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 47-year-old staff analyst for a federal contractor. He has held a security clearance since May 2003. He has worked for his current employer since March 2008. He previously worked for another federal contractor for about 22 years. He resigned from his previous employment in lieu of termination and was unemployed from November 2007 until March 2008. The conduct alleged in the SOR occurred while he was working for his previous employer. Applicant testified his current employer is aware of the allegations in the SOR (Tr. 54). On March 22, 2007, Applicant moved two classified computers from one classified area to another. He obtained the approval of his group leader and deputy group leader in advance, but he did not notify his information systems security officer (ISSO) (GX 4 at 4). He moved the computers because he believed the limitations on network access imposed by the ISSO at the old location limited his ability to do his job (Tr. 65). On March 29, 2007, Applicant attended a meeting about moving classified computers. He testified this meeting was about computers other than the two he had requested approval to move (Tr. 85), but security investigators found that the meeting was to discuss his requested move (GX 4 at 4).

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted an application to continue his security clearance on March \n14, 2008. On January 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to \nrevoke his clearance, citing security concerns under Guidelines K, M, and E. The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005.  \n \nJuly 22, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on January 30, 2009. He answered it through \ncounsel on February 18, 2009; and he requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge. DOHA received the request on February 19, 2009. Department Counsel was \nready to proceed on April 6, 2009, and the case was assigned to me on April 7, 2009. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 27, 2009, scheduling the hearing for May 19, \n2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 11 \nwere admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. The \nrecord closed upon adjournment of the hearing on May 19, 2009. DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) on May 27, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old staff analyst for a federal contractor. He has held a \nsecurity clearance since May 2003. He has worked for his current employer since \nMarch 2008. He previously worked for another federal contractor for about 22 years. He \nresigned from his previous employment in lieu of termination and was unemployed from \nNovember 2007 until March 2008. The conduct alleged in the SOR occurred while he \nwas working for his previous employer. Applicant testified his current employer is aware \nof the allegations in the SOR (Tr. 54). \n \n \nOn March 22, 2007, Applicant moved two classified computers from one \nclassified area to another. He obtained the approval of his group leader and deputy \ngroup leader in advance, but he did not notify his information systems security officer \n(ISSO) (GX 4 at 4). He moved the computers because he believed the limitations on \nnetwork access imposed by the ISSO at the old location limited his ability to do his job \n(Tr. 65).  \n \nOn March 29, 2007, Applicant attended a meeting about moving classified \ncomputers. He testified this meeting was about computers other than the two he had \nrequested approval to move (Tr. 85), but security investigators found that the meeting \nwas to discuss his requested move (GX 4 at 4). He told an investigator and he testified \nthat he disclosed at the meeting that he had moved his two computers on the day \nbefore the meeting (GX 4 at 13). One of the attendees at the meeting told investigators \nApplicant did not disclose the move of the computers at the meeting (GX 4 at 7).  \n \nOn March 30, 2007, the computers were discovered to be missing from their old \nlocation. When interviewed, Applicant stated he moved the computers on March 28, \n2007. Access logs reflected that Applicant entered the secure location to which he had \nmoved the computers on March 22, but not on March 28.  \n \nApplicant also told investigators he complied with an informal \u201ctwo-man rule\u201d for \nmoving classified equipment, and he named the employee who accompanied him. \nWhen advised that the employee denied participating in the move, Applicant named a \nsecond employee, who also denied participating in the move.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nFinally, Applicant stated he carried the two computers in a locked security bag. \nAn employee who observed Applicant entering the new location informed investigators \nthat Applicant was carrying only one computer and it was not in a bag, but the witness \nadmitted he \u201ccould not be absolute\u201d about the number of computers Applicant was \ncarrying (GX 4 at 12).  \n \nApplicant testified he did not know why he misidentified the person who escorted \nhim during the movement of the computers. He testified he \u201cjust got them confused.\u201d He \ndenied intending to give the investigators incorrect information (Tr. 48-49). \n \nApplicant testified he realized he had given the wrong date for moving the \ncomputers when he was reviewing his statement to the investigators. He explained that \nhe was focused on moving the computers and the date \u201cstuck in [his] head.\u201d He could \ngive no other explanation for the discrepancy (Tr. 70-71). He denied intentionally giving \nfalse or misleading information to the investigators (Tr. 49-51).  \n \nApplicant was first interviewed on May 2, 2007. He did not correct his statement \nregarding the date he moved the computers until June 7, 2007, when he was confronted \nwith the discrepancies in his first statement. He did not address his misidentification of \nthe person who accompanied him until he was interviewed again on June 18, 2007. \n \nApplicant testified he moved the computers in a locked bag. He testified he is \nconfident he moved the computers in a locked bag because the security officers in the \nnew location would have cited him for a security infraction and refused to accept them if \nthey had been transported incorrectly (Tr. 51-52). However, the security investigation \nconcluded that there was no formal policy on transporting classified computers (GX 4 at \n14; Tr. 116).  \n \nAlthough it was \u201ccommon practice\u201d to notify the ISSO when moving classified \ncomputers, there was no formal written guidance requiring it (GX 5 at 3). Applicant \ntestified he was aware of the \u201ctwo-man rule\u201d but was unaware of other policies \nregarding movement of computers from one secure area to another. He also testified he \ndid not intend to violate his employer\u2019s policies when he moved the computers (Tr. 32). \nOn June 20, 2007, after Applicant moved his computers, an email was distributed \nannouncing a requirement to notify the ISSO when any classified computers are moved \n(GX 4 at 18-19). \n \nDuring the inquiry into the move of the two computers, investigators also \ndiscovered that Applicant had failed to update his inventory database, failed to obtain \nISSO approval for switching disks on classified computers, failed to activate a password \nscreen lock on a classified computer, and failed to mark his media while working in a \nmixed media environment (GX 4 at 8-9). The computers were in a storeroom and not \nconnected to the network (GX 4 at 6).The investigators concluded there was no \nsuspected unauthorized disclosure of classified information (GX 4 at 4).  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant told investigators and testified he believed that the local rules allowed \ndisks to be removed and replaced for testing and maintenance for up to five days \nwithout notifying the ISSO and updating the documentation (GX 4 at 26). He testified he \ncould not recall whether he was performing tests or maintenance when he changed the \ndisks on his computer (Tr.38).  \n \nApplicant also testified he was required to activate a password screen lock on \nany computer for which he was responsible. He testified he could not respond \nspecifically to the allegation because he could not determine who was responsible for \nthe computers referred to by the investigators (Tr. 40).  \n \nThe local rules applicable to the secure local area network required marking of all \nclassified and unclassified media in mixed media work areas (GX 5 at 10). Applicant \ntestified he and the security staff had marked everything in his office \u201cwithin weeks\u201d \nbefore his access was suspended. He testified it was possible that something was \noverlooked, but he could not determine what improperly marked items the investigators \nfound (Tr. 41).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s access to classified areas was withdrawn on April 5, 2007 (GX 4 at \n5). While the investigation of the moving of computers was ongoing and Applicant\u2019s \naccess to classified areas was suspended, he voluntarily underwent retraining in \nsecurity procedures (Tr. 28).  \n \nThe local rules applicable to the secure local area network prohibited use of \nexternal memory sticks, thumb drives, or similar devices; and they prohibited making \nany configuration changes to computer systems without prior ISSO approval (GX 5 at \n11). On May 9, 2007, a thumb drive was found on the employer\u2019s property. Based on a \nreview of the contents on the thumb drive, it was identified as Applicant\u2019s property. The \nthumb drive contained personal photographs, work documents, and a short sexually-\nexplicit video-clip. The work documents were unclassified but were marked Official Use \nOnly (GX 4 at 15). \n \nApplicant told investigators he did not use the thumb drive at work. At the \nhearing, he testified he sometimes emailed documents from work to his home computer \nand he used his thumb drive to transfer documents between his home computer and his \nwork computer (Tr. 97-99). \n \nApplicant told investigators he carried the thumb drive with a chain hooked to his \nbelt, and it was lost when the chain broke (GX 4 at 15). At the hearing, he testified he \nbelieved he had dropped the thumb drive between two \u201cpackets\u201d of his work bag and it \ndropped out as he was walking from his car to his office. He did not know he had lost \nthe thumb drive until he was notified by security that it had been found. He testified he \nbelieved it would have been a security violation to carry the thumb drive into a secured \narea, but the thumb drive was lost after his access to secured areas had been \nwithdrawn. He testified he had forgotten about the sexually explicit video clip (Tr. 42-\n45). \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant had a reputation for \u201cflying under the radar\u201d regarding security rules \nand procedures. In March 2006, he violated the organization\u2019s \u201cextended security plan\u201d \nby transferring three classified hard drives from one location to another without notifying \nanyone (GX 4 at 14). In September 2006, a group administrator complained to \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor about Applicant\u2019s lack of cooperation on updating inventories (GX \n4 at 8). Applicant\u2019s supervisor told security investigators that Applicant had a history of \n\u201coperating independently from [his organization\u2019s] procedures,\u201d making his co-workers \nuncomfortable working with him (GX 4 at 6). Applicant\u2019s deputy office director told \nsecurity investigators Applicant had received several warnings during the past two to \nthree years about his security behavior (GX 4 at 5).  \n \n \nOn November 7, 2007, Applicant was notified he was being terminated for cause. \nThe termination notice recited that he exhibited a \u201ccavalier attitude\u201d toward security and \na willingness to bend the rules. It also recited that he deliberately provided misleading \ninformation to his supervisors and the security investigators (GX 3). Applicant was \nallowed to resign in lieu of termination (Answer to SOR; GX 2 at 5). He testified he did \nnot file a grievance to \u201cclear his name,\u201d because he had no desire to continue working \nfor that employer (Tr. 62). The \u201cReport by Office Concerned\u201d dated November 28, 2007, \nrecited that Applicant \u201chistorically had difficulty in adequately following all details \ninvolved with security\u201d and had been counseled numerous times (GX 4 at 17). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n\n \n6 \n \n \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant\u2019s access to classified areas at his place of \nemployment was suspended in March-April 2007 because of his noncompliance with \nsecurity procedures. SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges he acted without authorization and in violation \nof security procedures when transferring a computer at his place of employment, and he \nwas counseled and retrained in security procedures because of this violation and other \nunspecified incidents. SOR \u00b6 1.c alleges he violated security policies and procedures by \nbringing a thumb drive onto his place of employment that contained work product and \npornography, he lost the thumb drive but did not report its loss, and the thumb drive was \nfound in an unsecure location. SOR \u00b6 1.d alleges he was reprimanded, recommended \nfor termination for cause, and escorted from his place of employment because of his \nviolations of rules and regulations and deliberately providing misleading information to \nhis managers and security personnel.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 33 expresses the security concern pertaining to handling protected \ninformation: \u201cDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nprotecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about an individual's \ntrustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability to safeguard such \ninformation, and is a serious security concern.\u201d The relevant potentially disqualifying \nconditions are AG \u00b6 34(g) (\u201cany failure to comply with rules for the protection of \nclassified or other sensitive information\u201d) and AG \u00b6 34(h) (\u201cnegligence or lax security \nhabits that persist despite counseling by management\u201d).  \nSOR \u00b6 1.a does not allege any security violations separate from those alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d. Instead, it merely alleges the actions of his supervisors in response to \nthose violations. It essentially duplicates SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d. When the same conduct is \nalleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations \nshould be resolved in Applicant=s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 (App. Bd. Sep. \n21, 2005) at 3. Accordingly, I resolve SOR \u00b6 1.a in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nApplicant\u2019s transfer of his classified computers to a new location raised questions \nwhether he properly notified the appropriate officials of the move and whether he \nexecuted the move in accordance with prescribed security procedures. The evidence \nshows he obtained the approval of his supervisors for the intended move, but he did not \nnotify the ISSO responsible for the computers at the old location. The evidence also \nshows there was no formal, published rule requiring notification of the ISSO. The \nrequirement for ISSO notification was published after Applicant moved the computers.  \nApplicant was aware of an informal, unpublished \u201ctwo-man rule\u201d for moving \nclassified equipment, but his conflicting statements raise a question whether he \ncomplied with it. The evidence is also conflicting on the question whether Applicant \ntransported the computers in a locked bag. It is not necessary to resolve these conflicts, \nhowever, because the local security procedures did not provide specific guidance for \ntransporting classified computers. The investigators determined that there was no \ncompromise of classified information. Based on this record, I conclude the evidence \ndoes not support a finding that Applicant violated any rules when he moved the two \ncomputers.1 \nSOR \u00b6 1.b also alleges there were \u201cother incidents\u201d of rules violations that \nresulted in later counseling and retraining. The \u201cother incidents\u201d alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b \nare supported by substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s failure to update his inventory \ndatabase, failure to obtain ISSO approval for switching disks, failure to activate a \npassword screen lock, and failure to mark his media.  \nApplicant testified he believed carrying his thumb drive into a secure area would \nbe a security violation, but he admitted occasional use of the thumb drive to transfer \n                                                          \n1  Applicant\u2019s former employer was not an agency under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense. I \ncannot determine whether his conduct violated any applicable departmental regulations or directives \nbecause no evidence of the rules promulgated by the department having jurisdiction over his former \nemployer was presented. \n\n \n8 \n \n \ndocuments between his home computer and his work computer. The local rules \nspecifically prohibited use of thumb drives without prior ISSO approval. The work \ndocuments on the thumb drive were Official Use Only, and as such were \u201csensitive \ninformation\u201d within the meaning of this guideline. Applicant\u2019s failure to notice or report \nthe loss of his thumb drive containing sensitive information does not establish a \ndeliberate security violation, but it does indicate negligence. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges the actions taken by Applicant\u2019s supervisors for the violations \nalleged in of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c, and it additionally alleges that Applicant deliberately \nprovided misleading information to managers and security personnel. This latter \nallegation is supported by evidence that when Applicant was interviewed by security \ninvestigators he misstated the date he moved the computers, misidentified his escort for \nthe movement of the computers, and denied using the thumb drive at work. \n \nBased on the foregoing, I conclude there is substantial evidence raising the \ndisqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 34(g) and (h), shifting the burden to Applicant to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to \nthe government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cso much time has \nelapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so infrequently or under such unusual \ncircumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d AG 35(a). The first prong of this \nmitigating condition (\u201cso much time has elapsed\u201d) focuses on whether the conduct was \nrecent. There are no Abright line@ rules for determining when conduct is Arecent.@  The \ndetermination must be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence.  \nISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004).  If the evidence shows Aa \nsignificant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,@ then an \nadministrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates Achanged \ncircumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.@  Id.   \nMore than two years have elapsed since Applicant\u2019s security violations. However, \nhe was under investigation and his access to classified materials was suspended until \nhe resigned in lieu of termination in November 2007. He was unemployed from \nNovember 2007 until he began his current job in March 2008. Since March 2008, he \nhas been under the pressure of trying to keep his clearance. Under these \ncircumstances, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s conduct was \u201crecent\u201d because he has not \nworked for his current employer long enough to demonstrate reform or rehabilitation.  \nApplicant has a record of multiple security infractions that did not occur under \nunusual circumstances. The circumstances under which he left his previous \nemployment cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I \nconclude AG \u00b6 35(a) is not established. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual \nresponded favorably to counseling or remedial security training and now demonstrates \na positive attitude toward the discharge of security responsibilities.\u201d AG 35(b). Applicant \nunderwent remedial security training, but he has not worked long enough in a classified \nenvironment since his resignation in lieu of termination to demonstrate the \u201cpositive \nattitude\u201d required for this mitigating condition. \nFinally, security concerns may be mitigated if \u201cthe security violations were due to \nimproper or inadequate training.\u201d AG \u00b6 35(c). The security investigators found a lack of \nguidance in several areas of security concern, but the guidance was specific and clear \nregarding marking of media, password protection, and use of external devices such as \nthumb drives. Applicant\u2019s responses during the security investigation and at the hearing \ndemonstrated that he was familiar with the formal, written guidance as well as the \ninformal common practices at his workplace. I conclude AG \u00b6 35(c) is not established. \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology Systems \n \n \nThe SOR cross-alleges the same conduct discussed above under this guideline. \nThe concern under this guideline is: \u201cNoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines \nor regulations pertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the willingness \nor ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and information.\u201d AG \u00b6 39.  \n \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions are AG \u00b6 40(f) (\u201cintroduction, removal, or \nduplication of hardware, firmware, software, or media to or from any information \ntechnology system without authorization, when prohibited by rules, procedures, \nguidelines, or regulations\u201d) and AG \u00b6 40(g) (\u201cnegligence or lax security habits in \nhandling information technology that persist despite counseling by management\u201d). The \nevidence raises both of these disqualifying conditions. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cso much time has \nelapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d AG 41(a). Applicant\u2019s security violations \nwere recent and did not happen under unusual circumstances. His record of multiple \nviolations after repeated counseling precludes a finding that they are unlikely to recur. \nHis record casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I conclude \nAG 41(a) is not established. No other enumerated mitigating conditions are relevant. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe conduct alleged under Guidelines K and M is also cross-alleged under this \nguideline. The concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \n\n \n10 \n \n \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.   \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition regarding the information provided by \nApplicant during the security investigation is \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading \ninformation concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, \ncompetent medical authority, or other official government representative.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(b). \n \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the government \nhas the burden of proving it. A factual misstatement, standing alone, does not prove an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as \na whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the misstatement.  See ISCR Case No. 03-\n09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004).  \n \n \nI found Applicant\u2019s explanations for initially misstating the date he moved the \ncomputers and the identity of the persons who accompanied him implausible and not \ncredible. Accordingly, I conclude AG \u00b6 16(b) is raised.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by false or misleading answers during a security \ninvestigation may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith \nefforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with \nthe facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(a). Applicant was first interviewed on May 2, 2007. He did not \ncorrect his statement regarding the date he moved the computers until he was \nquestioned on June 7, 2007, and confronted with the discrepancies in his first \nstatement. He did not address his misidentification of the person who accompanied him \nuntil he was interviewed on June 18, 2007. AG \u00b6 17(a) is not established because \nApplicant\u2019s corrections of his misstatements were not prompt and did not occur until he \nwas confronted with the evidence. No other mitigating conditions are relevant to his \nstatements to security investigators. \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions for Applicant\u2019s security violations are AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n16(c) and (d). AG \u00b6 16(c) applies when there is:  \ncredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, \nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard \nprotected information. \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16(d) applies when there is: \n \ncredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other \nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, \nbut which, when combined with all available information supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information.\u201d  \n \nAG \u00b6 16(d) condition encompasses \u201ca pattern of dishonesty or rule violations.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n16(d)(3). Applicant\u2019s security infractions raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and (d). \n \n \nSecurity concerns arising from rules violations may be mitigated if \u201cthe offense is \nso minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). Applicant\u2019s \ninfractions were numerous and did not happen under unique circumstances. Some of \nApplicant\u2019s infractions were arguably minor, but when considered in totality they cast \ndoubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I conclude AG \u00b6 17(c) is not \nestablished. \n \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the \nbehavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps \nto alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n17(d). Applicant has acknowledged some of his infractions. He has attended remedial \ntraining and he is working in a new environment. Given his track record, however, I am \nnot satisfied that his behavior is not likely to recur. I conclude AG \u00b6 17(c) is not fully \nestablished. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n\n \n12 \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines K, M, and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature adult who worked for his previous employer for 22 years \nand held a clearance for many years. The investigation into his move of two classified \ncomputers revealed that many security procedures at his previous place of employment \nwere informal, and there no procedures published for certain actions, such as moving \nclassified computers. Nevertheless, Applicant was aware of the informal \u201ctwo-man rule\u201d \nand he believed there was a requirement that classified computers be transported in a \nlocked bag. He also was familiar with the published local rules prohibiting use of \nexternal devices such as thumb drives. His track record of repeated security lapses and \nhis false responses to security investigators raise serious questions about his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines K, M, \nand E, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns under these guidelines. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to continue his eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline K:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline M:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Kies, Esquire; Daniel C. Schwartz, Esquire\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nStatement of Case\nOn November 20, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992,\nand Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and\nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on December 9, 2008, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to another judge on January 6, 2009, and re-assigned to me on\nMarch 4, 2009.  The case was scheduled for hearing on March 24, 2009.  A hearing\nwas held as scheduled, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant, continue, or deny, Applicant\u2019s application\nfor a security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of nine exhibits;\nJune 16, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant relied on two witnesses (including himself) and 24 exhibits.  The transcript\n(R.T.) was received March 31, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to supplement the\nrecord with documentation of his efforts to resolve his creditor 1.a debt and payment of\nhis creditor 1.b debt. . For good cause shown, Applicant was granted 10 days to April 3,\n2009 to supplement the record.  The Government was granted three days to April 6,\n2009, to  respond.  Within the time permitted, Applicant provided copies of his statement\ncovering his payment efforts, letters to his creditor 1.b creditor seeking confirmation of\npayment, and a payment confirmation from creditor 1.b.  Department Counsel offered\nno objection to the admission of any of Applicant\u2019s proffered exhibits. The submissions\nwere admitted as exhibits Y through CC.  \nFollowing the close of the record, Applicant moved to supplement the record with\nadditional documentation from creditor 1.b regarding this creditor\u2019s acceptance of\nApplicant\u2019s settlement payment and expressed intention to report his account with the\ncredit bureaus as \u201csettled.\u201d  Department Counsel did not oppose Applicant\u2019s request,\nand for good cause shown, his request was granted.  Applicant\u2019s proffered\nsupplemental exhibit  was admitted as exhibit DD.\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have accumulated three debts\nexceeding $91,000.00.  They are listed as creditors 1.a through 1.c and will be referred\nto in this way in the findings and conclusions.\nFor his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted to of the debt  allegations.  He\nclaimed that his creditor 1.a debt had been written off, and that he had successfully\nworked with the creditor to satisfy other debts without hearing anything back on this\ndebt.  He claimed he has made good-faith efforts to resolve his creditor 1.b debt as best\nhe could given his divorce and court orders for child support and alimony. Appellant\ndenied being indebted to creditor 1.c, citing his executed deed in lieu of foreclosure on\nhis marital residence, which was necessitated after his wife moved out of the residence\nand obtained child support.  Applicant explained that the bank which accepted the deed\nin lieu of foreclosure took possession of the property and resold it.  He is currently\nworking with credit reporting agencies to remove any reported bank claims from his\ncredit reports. \nApplicant claimed he is required to hold a security clearance to retain his job and\nhas never committed a security violation in the 24 years he has held a security\nclearance.  He claimed he acted responsibly in his efforts to contact his creditors and\nresolve his debts.  He claimed he can never be blackmailed, and has since stabilized\nhis finances. \n\n3\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 48-year-old deputy chief engineer for a defense contractor who\nseeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by\nApplicant are incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material findings.\nAdditional findings follow.\nApplicant married W in October 1992 (see ex. 1).  He has two twin four-year old\nboys from this marriage.  While married, Applicant and W each worked an relied on their\ndual income to pay their bills (R.T., at 89).  Applicant and W maintained a budget and\nkept track of their bills and spending (R.T., at 90).  Rarely did they encounter any\nfinancial problems during their marriage (R.T., at 90-91).\nApplicant received his bachelor of science degree in computer science from a\nrecognized university in 1987, and earned a master degree in information systems from\nan accredited university in 1998 (see exs. 1-3 and G; R.T., at 46-47).  Between 1992\nand June 2007, Applicant worked for a number of companies.  Most of his work required\na security clearance (R.T., at 49, 52, 68). \nFor over 20 years during his marriage to W, Applicant exercised excellent\nfinancial responsibility in supporting his family and managing his finances.  He and W\nrefinanced their home (purchased in 2001) in July 2006 based on an appraised value of\n$627,000.00 (see ex. J).  The new mortgage payment of $4,000.00 a month required\nthe incomes of W and Applicant to support their household expenses and mortgage\npayments (ex. J; R.T., at 107). \nApplicant and W separated in February 2006 (see ex. H; R.T., at 165) after\nApplicant learned of his wife\u2019s having an affair with another man (R.T., at 92).  W filed\nfor divorce in November 2006 (see ex. J; R.T., at 92, 164-65).  In February 2007, W and\ntheir two children moved moved out of their house.  Once she vacated the home, she\nstopped contributing to household expenses and the mortgage (R.T., at 164).  In May\n2007, W filed for divorce and sought both child support and alimony (R.T., at 92-94).\nApplicant and W finalized their divorce in January 2008 (see exs. 1 and H; R.T., at 96,\n165-66). \nUnder his separation agreement with W, Applicant is obligated to pay W monthly\nchild support of $2,250.00 and monthly alimony of $850.00 (see exs. H and J; R.T. ,at\n94-97).  Applicant expects his alimony payments to end in seven years (R.T., at 95).\nHis separation agreement provides for broad joint custody of his two children that\npermits him to keep his children twice a week (R.T., at 94).  W has never expressed any\ninterest in marriage counseling, and they have never pursued reconciliation after their\nseparation.  \nWith his limited income following his separation to cover his mortgage and\nhousehold expenses, Applicant encountered considerable difficulty paying the mortgage\nand keeping up with his credit card obligations (R.T., at 107-08).  Sale opportunities\n\n4\nwere limited, too, as the value of his house had fallen below the face amount of his\nmortgage.  Not only could he not pay his mortgage or effectively dispose of the\nproperty, but he fell behind in his card debts with creditors 1.a and 1.b.  Ultimately,\nthese latter debts were written off by the creditors in the respective amounts of\n$5,503.00 and $43,610.00 (see exs. 5 and 6; R.T., at 104).  \nUnable to cover his mortgage and other expenses, Applicant contacted his\ncreditor 1.c mortgagee in March 2007 to explore prospects for lowering his monthly\nmortgage payments (see ex. J; R.T., at 107).  Creditor 1.c, in turn, informed Applicant\nthat it could do nothing for him until he had defaulted on his mortgage payments and\ndocumented his listing of the property for sale in a vacant state of condition (R.T., at\n108-09).\nCreditor 1.c followed up its oral advice with a written letter in June 2007\nacknowledging Applicant\u2019s request for a loss mitigation work out plan and forwarding an\nexplanation of financial hardship form (see ex. J).  Appellant promptly completed the\nfurnished financial hardship form and returned it to creditor 1.c.  In his letter he\nexplained his circumstances. He also informed creditor 1.c that due to the permanent\ncircumstances of his situation, he could foresee no other recourse but to request\nconsideration of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure (ex. J).  Applicant asked creditor !.c to\nwork with him on accepting a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. \nCreditor 1.c accepted Applicant\u2019s request for a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure in\nAugust 2007 (see ex. L; R.T., at 117), and furnished Applicant a prepared deed for his\nwritten execution.  Applicant and W executed the prepared deed in February 2008 and\nreturned it to the creditor (see ex. M; R.T., at 117-18).  Creditor 1.c, in turn, assigned\nApplicant\u2019s mortgage on the covered property to another financial institution for valuable\nconsideration in April 2008 (see ex. N, R.T., at 120).  Creditor 1.c furnished a\ntransaction listing report to Applicant in December 2008 (ex. O). The report tracks\nApplicant\u2019s payment history with his mortgage and confirms the payoff of Applicant\u2019s\n$595,000.00 first trust deed in October 2008 (see ex. O; R.T., at 120-21).  In a\nDecember 2009 letter to Applicant, Creditor 1.c confirmed its removal of Applicant\u2019s\nmortgage debt from his credit reports upon its acceptance of a deed-in-lieu of\nforeclosure from him (see ex. P; R.T., at 121-22).\nPrior to his divorce, Applicant had three separate accounts with creditor 1.a: a\nchecking account, a savings account, and a credit card (R.T., at 152).  Following his\ndivorce, he made concerted telephonic efforts throughout 2008 and early 2009 to settle\nhis creditor 1.a checking account (see exs. Y and Z; R.T., at 156-57).  Applicant did\nprovide documentation of a written offer to creditor 1.a in July 2008 to settle another of\nhis accounts with the same creditor with a lump sum $5,000.00 payment by credit card\n(see ex. X).  Applicant confirms he was able to successfully settle this account (R.T., at\n152-53, 180-81).  \nApplicant, however, has not experienced any success in discussing his creditor\n1.a account with any representative of the creditor. (R.T., at 178-79).  When he was\n\n5\nable to reach a customer operator associated with creditor 1.a in March 2009, he was\ntold the account was previously written off as a bad debt and could not be accessed\n(see exs. Y and Z; R.T., at 156-57).  The creditor 1.a operator furnished him a number\nto call to discuss his account.  When Applicant called this number, he determined it to\nbe a wrong number (see ex. Z).  Applicant assures he would very much like to resolve\nhis creditor 1.a debt, and would like a number or address to reach a creditor 1.a\nauthorized representative to resolve this debt (ex. Z).\nApplicant\u2019s creditor 1.b debt represents an accrued debt on a line of credit\nopened by Applicant in or about 1994.  Applicant obtained the line of credit  to finance\nhome expenditures for an upgraded bathroom in the basement of his home to\naccommodate his in-laws while they helped in the child support of his young twins (R.T.,\nat 124-25, 168-69).  For so long as he and his wife maintained their dual incomes, they\nwere able to comfortably manage this creditor 1.c account (R.T., at 125).  When his wife\nabandoned the home and stopped paying on their joint accounts, he encountered\ntrouble in meeting the monthly payments on this account, and stopped paying on it\n(R.T., at 125-26,170-71).  When he asked creditor 1.c for payment assistance, the\ncreditor was not helpful.  After talking with several debt consolidation groups, he\ndetermined to deal with the creditor directly. \nIn an unsigned August 2007 letter from a debt collection attorney purporting to\nrepresent creditor 1.b, the identified attorney offered to accept $22,613.00 in full\nsettlement of the debt, payable in two installments: an initial $5,000.00 payment and the\n$17,613.00 balance payable a month later (see ex. Q; R.T., at 127-31).  Applicant\npromptly remitted the first agreed payment of $5,000.00 to the creditor\u2019s collection agent\nwith the understanding he would remit the balance in 30 days (see ex. R; R.T., at 127-\n33, 172).  When he called the attorney agent\u2019s office in September 2007 to try and work\nout a more flexible payment plan on the $17,613.00 balance, he was told that the\nattorney did not work there anymore, and the payment plan was no longer operative\n(see ex. T; R.T., at 139-40, 172-75). \nIn July 2008, Applicant was contacted by a successor collection agent for creditor\n1.b, and arranged a new hardship payment plan with this new agent (see ex. T; R.T., at\n175-76).  This arrangement called for Applicant\u2019s making a $500.00 payment on another\ncredit card (bringing the debt down to $43,660.00) and remitting $10.00 a month until\nhis finances stabilized (see ex. T). Applicant never received any confirmation of this\narrangement from the creditor.  Two months later (in October 2008), he was advised\ntelephonically by this collection agent that the new arrangement was no longer valid\n(see ex. T; R.T., at 175-76).  When he received no response from creditor\u2019s 1.b\u2019s\ncollection agent, he concluded that the creditor had determined to write off the debt, and\nso informed the creditor in his follow-up letters in December 2008 and January 2009\n(see exs. T and U).  \nIn March 2009, Applicant received a written offer from a new collection agent of\ncreditor 1.b (see ex. V; R.T., at 144-45).   In its March 2009 letter, creditor 1.b offered to\nsettle its debt for a lump sum payment of $6,541.61.  Applicant accepted the offer and\n\n6\nmade prompt payment in full on his credit card (see ex. W; R.T., at 145-51).  Applicant\nassures he has enough cash flow under his established budget to make the payments\non the credit card he used to pay his creditor 1.b debt.\nConcerned about the absence of any payment satisfaction confirmation from\ncreditor 1.b,  Applicant wrote to creditor 1.b and its new collection agent in May 2009\n(exs. AA and BB) seeking confirmation of his $6,541.61 payment in full settlement of the\noutstanding balance (see exs. AA and  BB).  Creditor 1.b confirmed in an April 2009\nletter its receipt of Applicant\u2019s $6,541.61 payment in full settlement of the debt (see ex.\nCC).  This creditor 1.b account is paid in full.  Creditor 1.b, in turn, committed to\nnotifying the credit reporting agencies of Applicant\u2019s \u201csettled\u201d account (see ex. DD).\nSince encountering debt problems following his marital separation and divorce,\nApplicant has worked hard to repay his debts and restore his credit (R.T., at 159-62).  In\naccordance with his separation agreement, he has full joint custody over his two young\nboys and spends almost every weekend with them (R.T., at 94).  Additionally, he has\nthem with him two to three nights a week in his rented condominium (R.T., at 99-101).\nApplicant has reduced the number of credit cards he owns to just one, adheres to a\nprepared budget, and is current in all of his other accounts (see exs. 6 and I; R.T., at\n99-103).  While he has never committed to a counseling program, he has talked to\ndivorce and tax/bankruptcy lawyers to gain a better understanding of all of the legal and\ntax ramifications of his divorce (R.T., at 105). \nApplicant is highly regarded by his supervisors past and present, and by the\nmilitary commands he has served for over 15 years (see exs. A through E; R.T., at 55-\n85).  The executive director of his department praises his engineering expertise and\nwork product, and characterizes his abilities, integrity and loyalties as of the \u201chighest\norder\u201d (see ex. D). \nApplicant\u2019s current program manager who has daily contact with him considers\nhim an excellent technical programmer (R.T., at 28-29).  Aware of Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems, this program manager is of the opinion that Applicant followed all of the rules\nof financial responsibility, and is reliable and trustworthy (R.T., at 32-34).  Applicant has\nreceived numerous awards and commendations in recognition of his many contributions\nto his employer and its U.S. Air Force customer (ex. F).  \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if\nany, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or\ndenied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in\narriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\n\n7\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E2(a) of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial\ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known\nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds\nfrom financially profitable criminal acts.\u201d Adjudication Guidelines, \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a\nthreshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility\nfor a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\nJudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfacts alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\n\n8\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a highly regarded deputy chief engineer for a defense contractor who\naccumulated several delinquent debts following his divorce and loss of joint income from\nhis marriage. The three listed debts are considerable (over $91,000.00 in listed accrued\ndelinquent debts).  Until last year, none of these debts were resolved.  Without resolution\nthese debts create security significant concerns.\nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines where the individual applicant is so financially\noverextended as to indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide\nby rules and regulations, which can raise questions about the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information, and place the person at risk\nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Applicant\u2019s accumulation of\ndelinquent debts and his past inability to pay these debts warrant the application of two\nof the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines\u00b6 DC 19(a), inability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts, and \u00b619(c) \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s debts are attributable in part to his divorce and ensuing loss of joint\nmarital income to cover his refinanced mortgage and consumer debts, and in the\nimposition of significant monthly child support and marital alimony following his final\ndivorce decree and marital settlement.  He has worked earnestly these past two years to\nresolve his mortgage debt (which exceeded the diminished value of his home) and his\ntwo accrued consumer debts.  His furnished documentation corroborates his oral claims\nthat he has resolved his two largest debts, as he struggles to find a creditor 1.a\nrepresentative who will work with him to resolve his smaller creditor 1.a debt.  Today,\nonly Applicant\u2019s $5,500.00 creditor 1.a debt remains unresolved, despite earnest\nApplicant efforts to address. \nFaced with so many pressing challenges to resolve his debts, support his family,\nand restore his credit, while continuing to provide high quality service to his employer,\nApplicant has succeeded in not only favorably impressing his supervisors at work, but in\nresolving all but one of his delinquent debts, keeping his current accounts up to date,\nand providing uninterrupted support for his children and ex-wife.  \nBased on his evidentiary showing, extenuating circumstances are associated with\nApplicant\u2019s inability to address his mortgage amidst a falling real estate market ro\ndischarge all of his consumer obligations without the joint marital income he came to rely\non during his marriage to W.  Available to Applicant is \u00b6 MC 20(b) of the financial\nconsiderations guideline, \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the individual acted\nresponsibility.\u201d  While some judgment problems persist over Applicant\u2019s deed-in-lieu of\nforeclosure to cure a mortgage default and the delinquent consumer debts he accrued\nduring difficult financial cicrumcstances, they are considerably extenuated and more\nrecently mitigated by his restorative efforts. \n\n9\nBecause of the limited income available to Applicant between 2007 and 2009, he\nhas not heretofore been in a position to address his large mortgage debt and deficiency\nbalances associated with creditors 1.a and 1.b.  Neither of these creditors have made\nany noticeable collection efforts during the past three years, and there is no evidence\nthat any of his listed creditors will make any payment demands in the foreseeable future.\nWith the debts of creditors 1.b and1.c now clearly resolved, only creditor 1.a remains as\na potential claimant. \nTrue, creditor 1.a charged off its debt some time ago and shows no inclination to\nreopen Applicant\u2019s account for payment or settlement.  So, at this time, he  is essentially\nfree of any collectible debt.   For all practicable purposes, he is no longer at risk to\nhaving to raise large sums of money to resolve his debts.  That the creditor may no\nlonger being seeking payment enforcement is not controlling, however; judgment and\nreliability issues still retain their relevance in assessing Applicant\u2019s overall reliability and\ntrustworthiness.\nIn recognition of the concerted efforts Applicant has made to resolve all of his\ndebts in the aftermath of his divorce, mitigation credit is generally available to him  based\non his credible proofs of his systematic good faith repayment efforts.  Age of the one still\nunresolved debt (creditor 1.a) is covered by two of the mitigating conditions for financial\nconsiderations: \u00b6 MC 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d and \u00b6 MC 20(d), \u201cthe individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\nNeither mitigating condition is dispositive, but both have some applicability to Applicant\u2019\nsituation.  \n                                                    \nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.  Financial\nstability in a person cleared to access classified information is required precisely to\ninspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While the principal concern of\na clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and\ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in financial cases (as here).\nWhole person assessment permits both extenuation and mitigation of Applicant\u2019s\naccumulated delinquent debts.  Extenuating circumstances associated with his divorce,\nloss of historical spousal income to meet his mortgage and consumer obligations, and\nimposed child support and alimony, and the deteriorating housing market in his area,\ntogether created a confluence of factors that temporarily impaired his ability to meet all of\nhis financial obligations.  Judgment lapses do not play any material role in his debt\naccumulations.  There is no evidence presented that Applicant was living beyond his\nmeans during his marriage.  Since his separation and divorce, he has done all that could\nbe reasonably expected of him to pay his debts and responsibly and seasonably and\ncare for his children\u2019s needs. His good judgment and trustworthiness draw reinforcement\n\n10\nfrom past supervisors and military commands he has served, as well as from his\nprogram manager who works closely with him and can attest to his strong character.\nTaking into account all of the extenuating facts and circumstances surrounding\nApplicant\u2019s debt accumulations, the isolated and aberrant circumstances associated with\nhis debts, and his documented steps taken to resolve them, the responsibility and\ntrustworthiness he is credited with in his work and personal life as a single father who\nprovides hands-on personal and financial support for his children, he mitigates judgment\nand trustworthiness concerns related to his debts.  Favorable conclusions warrant with\nrespect to the allegations covered by the financial considerations guideline.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E 2(a) factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F: (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 1.a through 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.\nClearance is granted.\n                                          \nRoger C.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR contains six allegations of financial delinquency under AG \u00b6 18, Financial Considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.f.). In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted five of the Guideline F allegations of financial delinquency and provided additional information (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., and 1.f.). He denied one allegation (SOR \u00b6 1.e.). Applicant\u2019s admissions are entered herein as findings of fact. (Item 1; Item 3; Item 4.) Applicant is 63 years old, married, and a retired federal employee. He receives a net monthly federal retirement annuity of $3,847, and he seeks a security clearance for part-time work as an investigator for a government contractor. (Item 4 at 3; Item 5; Item 6 at 18.) In 2007, Applicant\u2019s wife lost her job, which paid approximately $40,000 a year, plus benefits. She remains unemployed. In his part-time work as an investigator, Applicant earned approximately $3,668 between January 2008 and October 2008.1 (Item 4 at 2; Item 6 at 16.) In retirement, Applicant invested in real estate. He purchased two properties: his residence and a second home, which he purchased in April 2006 as a rental property. His home was secured by a mortgage of $355,000. The rental property was secured by a mortgage of $253,000. Applicant also had a home equity loan of approximately $79,954 on the rental property. His monthly mortgage payment on his home was $2,845.

His eligibility for a security \nclearance is denied. \n \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SF-86) on February 16, \n2008. On January 15, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \nOctober 13, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR was signed and notarized on February 6, 2009. \nHowever, it was not complete when it was received by DOHA. Applicant then submitted \na complete answer, which was signed and notarized on February 27, 2009. He \nrequested a decision on the record in lieu of a hearing. The Government compiled its \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM) on August 7, 2009. The FORM contained documents \nidentified as Items 1 through 8. By letter dated August 10, 2009, DOHA forwarded a \ncopy of the FORM to Applicant, with instructions to submit any additional information \nand objections within 30 days of receipt. Applicant received the file on August 19, 2009. \nHis response was due not later than September 18, 2009. Within the required time \nperiod, he submitted an explanatory cover letter and seven attachments. Department \nCounsel did not object to Applicant\u2019s submission. On September 17, 2009, the case \nwas assigned to me for a decision. I marked Applicant\u2019s submission as Item 9 and \nadmitted it to the record.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains six allegations of financial delinquency under AG \u00b6 18, \nFinancial Considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.f.). In his Answer to the SOR, \nApplicant admitted five of the Guideline F allegations of financial delinquency and \nprovided additional information (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., and 1.f.). He denied one \nallegation (SOR \u00b6 1.e.). Applicant\u2019s admissions are entered herein as findings of fact.  \n(Item 1; Item 3; Item 4.) \n \n \nApplicant is 63 years old, married, and a retired federal employee. He receives a \nnet monthly federal retirement annuity of $3,847, and he seeks a security clearance for \npart-time work as an investigator for a government contractor. (Item 4 at 3; Item 5; Item \n6 at 18.) \n \n \nIn 2007, Applicant\u2019s wife lost her job, which paid approximately $40,000 a year, \nplus benefits. She remains unemployed. In his part-time work as an investigator, \nApplicant earned approximately $3,668 between January 2008 and October 2008.1 \n(Item 4 at 2; Item 6 at 16.) \n \n \nIn retirement, Applicant invested in real estate. He purchased two properties: his \nresidence and a second home, which he purchased in April 2006 as a rental property. \nHis home was secured by a mortgage of $355,000. The rental property was secured by \na mortgage of $253,000. Applicant also had a home equity loan of approximately \n$79,954 on the rental property. His monthly mortgage payment on his home was \n$2,845. His monthly mortgage payment on his rental property was $1,759, and his \nmonthly payment on the home equity loan was $632. (Item 9 at 5, 14.) \n \n1The record does not specify whether taxes had been deducted from the amounts Applicant reported as \npart-time income.   \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \n \nIn August 2007, Applicant\u2019s tenants moved out. He tried to sell the property, but \nwas unable to do so. He contacted the mortgage lender and sought a loan modification \nagreement. He executed a loan modification agreement with the lender, and he found \nanother tenant in January 2008. He charged the second tenant a monthly rent of \n$1,500. In May 2008, Applicant had the tenant served with a demand for rent. When the \ntenant failed to pay the rent within the specified time period, she was evicted. (Item 9 at \n1, 11-12.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties continued. He was unable to find reliable renters, \nand he was unable to pay the two mortgages and the home equity loan unless he \nreceived rent from one of the properties. As a result of the downturn in the real estate \nmarket, he was unable to sell the properties. In June 2008, to avoid foreclosure, he \nagreed to short sale proceedings for the two properties. In March 2009, the rental \nproperty was sold in a short sale2 for the purchase price of $274,207. In his Answer to \nthe SOR and in response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant asserted that the home \nequity loan was rolled into the short sale of the rental property, but he provided no \ndocumentation to corroborate this statement. In April 2009, his residence was sold in a \nshort sale for an unspecified amount. The home equity loan debt of $79,954 was \nalleged at SOR \u00b6 1.a.; the rental property debt of $253,000 was alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.b.; \nand the home mortgage debt of $355,000 was alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.d. (Item 1; Item 3; \nItem 4; Item 6 at 2-3; Item 9 at 1, 13-19.)    \n \n  \nIn documentation filed on September 26, 2007, with his mortgage lender, \nApplicant, identifying himself as \u201cborrower,\u201d reported the following net monthly income: \nwages, $3,965; annuity; $4,462; paycheck deductions, $1,112. In documentation filed \nwith DOHA on November 9, 2008, Applicant reported a net monthly income of $3,848, \nmonthly fixed expenses of $2,695; credit card and consumer debt payments of $1,288; \nand a negative monthly remainder of $135. He reported no monthly payments on the \nreal property mortgages, which he stated were in short sale status. (Item 9 at 5; Item 6 \nat 13-14.) \n \n \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant also listed monthly financial \nobligations of $688 and $423 for installment payments on two automobiles. The total \nindebtedness on the two automobile loans was $31,378. Applicant provided a footnote \nstating that the $423 monthly payment was being made by a relative, who had \npossession of the vehicle. (Item 6 at 14.) \n  \n \nApplicant admitted a delinquent credit card debt of $6,351, which was alleged at \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. He provided documentation in his response to DOHA interrogatories \nshowing that he had made monthly payments of $100 on the debt in March, May, July, \n \n2 I take administrative notice that a short sale is a real estate transaction that occurs when the net \nproceeds from the sale of a home or residential property are not enough to cover the seller\u2019s mortgage \nobligations and closing costs, such as property taxes, transfer taxes, and real estate agents\u2019 \ncommissions. Short sales are likely to occur when the seller (borrower) is in default on the underlying \nmortgage, the lender has given notice of foreclosure, and the seller (borrower) is unable or unwilling to \npay the difference between what the property sells for and what is owed.   \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSeptember, October, and November 2008. He failed to provide evidence of payment \nafter November 2008. (Item 3; Item 4: Item 6 at 5-10.) \n  \n \nApplicant denied owing a delinquent credit card of $1,384, alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.e. \nThe debt was listed as over 120 days delinquent as of January 1, 2008, on Applicant\u2019s \ncredit report of March 2008. Applicant\u2019s credit report of December 2008, listed the \naccount as closed by the creditor grantor. Applicant claimed that the account was not \nhis, but he acknowledged that he had a separate account with the same grantor, which \nwas current. He failed to provide documentation to establish that the delinquency \nalleged at SOR \u00b6 1.e. was not his. (Item 3; Item 4; Item 6 at 2-3; Item 7; Item 8.) \n \n  \n \nApplicant admitted a delinquent debt of $568, alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.f. The debt \narose when an individual with whom he co-signed a car note discontinued automobile \ninsurance and refused to pay the debt after the automobile was totally destroyed in an \naccident. Applicant stated he would not pay the debt because \u201cI have never had this \nvehicle in my possession nor [do] I know where the vehicle is.\u201d He further stated: \u201cI am \naware that a co-signer is also obligated, but I refuse to pay for something I do not have, \nnor ever had.\u201d (Item 4 at 2.) \n \n \nThe record does not establish that Applicant has received financial counseling. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    Policies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an   \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \n\n \n5 \n \n \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Beginning in about 2006 or 2007, Applicant accumulated substantial \ndelinquent debt and did not pay his creditors. This evidence is sufficient to raise these \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \nSeveral mitigating conditions could apply to Applicant\u2019s case. If the financially \ndelinquent behavior \u201chappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(a) might apply. If \n\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(b) might apply.  If \u201cthe person has received or \nis receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(c) might apply.  If \u201cthe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(d) might apply.  Finally, if \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to \ndispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and \nprovides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence \nof actions to resolve the issue,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(e) might apply. \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife lost her job in 2007, which caused financial hardship because \nher annual income of approximately $40,000 was needed to help pay the mortgages on \ntheir real estate properties and their other consumer debt. Additionally, Applicant was \nunable to rent his property to reliable tenants. When his tenant did not pay her rent in \n2007, he took action to have her evicted. However, the decline in the real estate market \nmade it difficult to rent or sell the two properties. Applicant contacted his mortgage \nlenders and agreed to have the two properties sold in short sales, and the short sales \nwere concluded in March and April of 2009. \n \nThe circumstances associated with the real property debts were unusual and \nwere at least in part beyond Applicant\u2019s control. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s job loss in \n2007 was also beyond his control. Applicant acted responsibly by contacting his \nmortgage lenders and agreeing to short sales of the properties when it became clear \nthat the mortgages would be foreclosed. \n \nThe record does not establish that Applicant has participated in financial \ncounseling, nor does it establish that Applicant\u2019s financial situation has stabilized or is \nunder control. In the financial statement he submitted in response to DOHA \ninterrogatories, Applicant reported a negative monthly net remainder of $135 after \npaying consumer debt unrelated to his two mortgage loans and his home equity loan. \nHe reported his annuity as his stable source of income, and his wife continues to be \nunemployed.  I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(c) apply only in part. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                           \n \nApplicant admitted a delinquent credit card debt of $6,351, and he provided \nevidence of six monthly payments $100 in 2008. However, he failed to provide evidence \nof a payment plan or continuing good-faith payments in 2009. He denied a delinquent \ncredit card debt that appeared on his credit report of March 2008. He asserted he had \nan account with the same creditor that was not delinquent. He failed to provide \ndocumentation to corroborate that the alleged delinquent debt was not his.3 Additionally, \nApplicant admitted a delinquent debt but refused to pay it, even though he \nacknowledged a legal obligation to do so and failed to establish that he had a \nreasonable basis to dispute the debt.  I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and 20(e) do not \napply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult. To his \ncredit, he provided documentation to corroborate that he had consulted with his \nmortgage lenders and had resolved his mortgage debts through short sales in lieu of \nforeclosure. However, he failed to establish that the home equity loan was folded into \nthe short sale of his rental property, and he failed to show that he had made consistent \ngood-faith efforts to identify and resolve the debts identified at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c., 1.e., and \n1.f.  He has not established a reliable track record of timely and consistent payment of \nhis debts over time. Because he has not received financial counseling and appears to \n \n3 ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) provides, \u201cApplicant\u2019s credit report was \nsufficient to establish the Government\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant had [deleted] delinquent [SOR] \ndebts that are of security concern.\u201d Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his response \nto DOHA interrogatories. \n\n \n8 \n \n \nlack a clear plan for resolving his delinquent debts, it is likely that his financially \ndelinquent behavior will recur. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his \nfinancial delinquencies.    \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n           Against Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant submitted a response to the SOR, dated\nJanuary 21, 2009, and requested a decision based on the written record without a hearing.\nHe denied all allegations listed in the SOR.\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nMay 29, 2009\n\n2\nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on February 19,\n2009, that was mailed to Applicant on February 20, 2009. Applicant was informed he had\n30 days from receipt of the FORM to submit his objections to any information contained\nin the FORM or to submit any additional information he wanted considered. It is unclear\nwhen Applicant actually received the FORM. However, on March 25, 2009, Applicant\nrequested additional time to respond to the FORM. Although the file does not contain any\ninformation that anyone connected with DOHA approved Applicant\u2019s request for additional\ntime, it does contain Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, dated April 25, 2009. On May 1,\n2009, Department Counsel executed a memorandum indicating he did not object to the\nadmissibility of Applicant\u2019s submissions. The case was assigned to me on May 11, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings\nof fact:\nApplicant is a 57-year-old man who has been employed by a defense contractor as\na project manager since May 2008. From February 2004 until May 2008, he was employed\nby a hospital as a project manager. From June 2001 until January 2004, he was employed\nby a construction company as a project manager. \nApplicant has been married since August 1978. He was previously married in May\n1972, but that marriage ended in divorce in May 1977. He did not list any children in the\nsecurity clearance application he submitted on May 21, 2008. \nThe SOR alleges 12 delinquent accounts, totaling $26,649, that have been\nsubmitted for collection, charged off as bad debts, or reported as past due. Applicant\ndenied each of these debts in his response to the SOR with notations that they were either\n\u201cPending Insurance Settlement\u201d or \u201cPending Agreed Settlement Offer.\u201d In response to\ninterrogatories propounded to him by DOHA, Applicant submitted various documents that\npurported to show the status of some of the accounts. In response to the FORM, Applicant\nsubmitted more documents which he asserted showed the majority of the accounts had\nbeen satisfied. \nSOR subparagraph 1.a alleges a medical debt owing in the amount of $937.\nApplicant\u2019s June and November Credit Bureau Reports (CBR) disclose this account was\nopened by the listed collection agency in June 2004. In his response to interrogatories,\nApplicant stated he was disputing this account with an insurance carrier. In his response\nto the FORM, Applicant stated he is still disputing this account with an insurance carrier,\nthat the balance listed is incorrect, and that once the insurance carrier acknowledges the\nbalance owing should only be $401 he will set up a payment plan and satisfy the debt in\nfour installments. The record does not contain information from which a conclusion can be\ndrawn that the documentation Applicant submitted relates to the debt listed in\nsubparagraph 1.a.\nSOR subparagraph 1.b alleges a medical debt owing in the amount of $755. The\nJune and November CBRs disclose this account was opened by the listed collection\nagency in December 2003. In his response to interrogatories, Applicant stated he was\n\n3\ndisputing this account with an insurance carrier. In his response to the FORM, Applicant\nstated he had found the records that show the account was satisfied. In support thereof,\nhe included a hospital bill, dated June 20, 2001, that disclosed charges due in the amount\nof $526.39, with all but $75 having been paid by insurance. Hand written on the bill is a\nnotation that the $75 had been paid. The record does not contain information from which\na conclusion can be drawn that the documentation Applicant submitted relates to the debt\nlisted in subparagraph 1.b.\nSOR subparagraph 1.c alleges a medical debt owing in the amount of $393. The\nJune and November CBRs disclose this account was opened by the listed collection\nagency in August 2004. Applicant did not address this debt in his response to\ninterrogatories or in his response to the FORM.\nSOR subparagraph 1.d alleges a medical debt owing in the amount of $915.\nApplicant\u2019s June and November Credit Bureau Reports (CBR) disclose this account was\nopened by the listed collection agency in June 2003. In his response to interrogatories,\nApplicant stated he was disputing this account with an insurance carrier. In his response\nto the FORM, Applicant stated he had found the records to show the account was satisfied.\nIn support thereof, he submitted copies of two checks, both dated June 2, 2002, one\npayable to a hospital in the amount of $540, and the second payable to a physician\u2019s group\nin the amount of $52.60. The record does not contain information from which a conclusion\ncan be drawn that the documentation Applicant submitted relates to the debt listed in\nsubparagraph 1.d.\nSOR subparagraph 1.e alleges a credit card account owing in the amount of $470.\nIn his response to interrogatories, Applicant stated this account was paid in full. He\nattached to his response a letter from a collection agency indicating the account had been\ntransferred to another collection agency, letters from another firm with an offer to settle an\naccount that lists the original collection agency on this account but with different account\nnumbers and balances due, and a cashier\u2019s check payable to the last listed firm payable\nin an amount that is different from that listed in any of the other letters. In his response to\nthe FORM, Applicant again stated the account was paid in full but that he is unable to find\ndocuments to support that assertion.\nSOR subparagraph 1.f alleges a debt owing in the amount of $5,055 that is listed\nin Applicant\u2019s June 2008 CBR as \u201cunknown loan type.\u201d In his response to interrogatories,\nApplicant stated this account was the result of fraud and that he was disputing the account\nin anticipation of eventual arbitration. He attached to his response a letter from the original\naccount holder, dated April 14, 2005, which indicate Applicant had submitted a forgery\nclaim to the bank and was required to close the account which may have caused the return\nof checks that had been written on the account. In his response to the FORM, Applicant\nstated the bank had charged off this account based on his claim of fraud and that his CBR,\ndated March 5, 2009, listed a zero balance owing. Actually, the March 2009 CBR, lists the\ncreditor alleged in subparagraph 1.f with a current balance owing in the amount of $5,286.\nThere is no evidence in the record to conclude this delinquency in any way relates to the\nforgery claim made to the bank.  \n\n4\nSOR subparagraph 1.g alleges a debt owing for cellular telephone service in the\namount of $192. Applicant\u2019s June and November 2008 CBRs disclose the last activity on\nthis account occurred in May 2002, and the date of the report listed by the collection\nagency is June 2004. In his response to interrogatories, Applicant asserted this account\nhad been paid in full. He did not submit any proof of payment at that time. In his response\nto the FORM, Applicant again asserted the account had been paid in full and included two\nchecks, dated January 16, 2002 and December 16, 2002, in the total amount of $254.39\nthat were made payable to the cellular phone company. This account is not listed in\nApplicant\u2019s March 2009 CBR. It is impossible to tell from the record if the checks submitted\nby Applicant represent the total amount owed on the account at the time, and, if so, why\nthe account would have been submitted for collection a year and a half after the last\npayment was made on the account.  \nSOR subparagraph 1.h alleges the balance owing on a repossessed automobile in\nthe amount of $14,025. Applicant\u2019s June and November 2008 CBRs disclose this account\nwas opened in November 2004, and the date of last activity on the account was May 2006.\nIn his response to interrogatories, Applicant stated the account was being disputed\nbecause the car had been auctioned for more than was owed on the account. He also\nasserted it was \u201cUnder legal counsel.\u201d In his response to the FORM, Applicant repeated\nthe assertions he had made in his response to interrogatories. He also submitted checks\nmade payable to the creditor which again appear to relate to the debt alleged in\nsubparagraph 1.i. \nSOR subparagraph 1.I alleges late automobile payments owing in the amount of\n$2,382. Applicant\u2019s June and November 2008 CBRs disclose this account was opened in\nNovember 1999, and the date of last activity on the account was August 2002. In his\nresponse to interrogatories, Applicant asserted that this account had been paid in full and\nhis payment had been returned after the car was repossessed. However, he inexplicably\nalso asserted that he was disputing the account because the balance was incorrect and\nhe was requesting arbitration. In his response to the FORM, Applicant again asserted the\naccount had been paid in full and went on to note it no longer appeared in his March 2009\nCBR. He also enclosed two checks, dated October 15, 2002, and December 16, 2002, that\nwere made payable to this creditor.   \nApplicant submitted documents from the creditor listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.h\nand 1.I that do not appear to relate to either account based on the January and March\n2006 dates on those documents. However, because he obliterated the account numbers\non the documents it is impossible to state with certainty to what account(s) they relate. \nSOR subparagraph 1.j alleges a medical bill owing in the amount of $739.\nApplicant\u2019s June 2008 CBR discloses this account was opened in May 2003, and the date\nof last activity was May 2008. In his response to interrogatories, Applicant stated he was\ndisputing this account with an insurance carrier. He submitted a number of medical\nstatements and other documents pertaining to medical bills that may or may not be\nconnected to this bill. In his response to the FORM, Applicant asserted this bill had been\npaid in full by insurance paying a portion of the bill and him paying the balance. He\nattached four checks, three of which are dated June 2, 2002, with the fourth check being\ndated August 8, 2002, that appear to be made payable to two radiology practices. The total\n\n Applicant actually listed his monthly payments as being $3,005. However, the math makes clear that he\n2\ncombined his recurring monthly expenses and debts payments to arrive at that figure. \n5\namount paid by those checks is $101.88. While it is impossible to determine with certainty\nfrom the record evidence if those checks relate to the account alleged in subparagraph 1.j,\nit must be noted that Applicant\u2019s March 2009 CBR does indicate the account arose from\nradiologic services provided by a creditor with a name similar to that listed on the checks\nsubmitted by Applicant. However, the March 2009 CBR also discloses the account was\nupdated in January 2009, and remains in a collection status with a balance owing of $739.\nSOR subparagraph 1.k alleges a medical bill owing in the amount of $561.\nApplicant\u2019s June 2008 CBR discloses this account was opened in August 2003, and the\ndate of last activity was May 2008. In his response to interrogatories, Applicant asserted\nthis account was in dispute with an insurance carrier. This account is also listed in\nApplicant\u2019s March 2009 CBR, which also lists the name of the medical provider who\nsubmitted the claim. Applicant included two statements with his response to interrogatories\nand with his response to the FORM that indicated Applicant and his wife owed the provider\n$401 after insurance payments were applied to the account. Applicant provided a\nsomewhat lengthy explanation in his response to the FORM in which he asserted he was\nunable to find a check to verify he had made a payment on this account and the insurance\ncarrier had merged with another carrier preventing him from obtaining information from the\ninsurance company. \n    \nSOR subparagraph 1.l alleges a medical bill owing in the amount of $92. Applicant\u2019s\nJune 2008 CBR discloses this account was opened in September 2003, and the date of\nlast activity was May 2008. In his response to interrogatories, Applicant again asserted he\nwas in dispute with an insurance carrier over this bill. This account is also listed in\nApplicant\u2019s March 2009 CBR, which identifies the original creditor as an anesthesiology\npractice. Applicant submitted a statement, dated June 2003, from this creditor with his\nresponse to interrogatories. That statement indicates Applicant owed a balance of $92.35\nfor services provided to his wife after insurance payments in the amount of $1,180.65 had\nbeen applied to the account. In his response to the FORM, Applicant stated this account\nhad been paid as part of the claim submitted in connection with the debt alleged in\nsubparagraph 1.k, and was an example of \u201cdouble dipping\u201d which is an example of why he\nis disputing the medical bills alleged in the SOR.\nApplicant submitted wage statements, dated June 3, 2008, and June 17, 2008,  with\nhis response to interrogatories that establish his net bi-weekly earnings at that time were\n$2,616.13. He also submitted a personal financial statement at the same time in which he\nonly claimed to have a net monthly income of $4,369. He listed his recurring monthly\nexpenses at $1,450, his monthly debt payments at $1,555 and his net remainder at\n$1,364.  He also listed his total assets as being $955,000, of which $700,000 was asserted\n2\nto consist of stocks and/or bonds.\nApplicant\u2019s only explanations for his delinquent indebtedness was contained in his\nresponse to the SOR wherein he attributed his financial problems to a medical emergency\nand loss of a job. He did not elaborate on how these incidents affected his ability to pay his\ndebts, especially in consideration of the substantial assets he claims to possess, or what\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n3\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n4\n Department of the Navy v. Egan 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n5\n6\nactions he took to mitigate the problems other that to assert \u201cthe records will also show\nwhere we were able to request relief from the creditors until such time we could recover\nand begin to make restitution.\u201d\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) in May 2008. In response to applicable questions, he failed to disclose, as required,\nthat he had been over 180 days delinquent on any debt in the preceding seven years or\nthat he was then currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt. His June and November\n2008 CBRs disclose he had numerous accounts that should have been disclosed in\nresponse to those questions, most dating back several years. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant denied both personal conduct allegations by\nincredibly claiming that because he had \u201congoing communication of settlement offers\u201d from\nsome creditors he did not deem the accounts to be delinquent. The settlement offers he\nwas referring to are apparently those he included with his response to interrogatories that\ndate from January 2006 to March 2007. In his response to interrogatories, he justified his\nfailure to disclose the delinquent accounts by asserting he considers the accounts\n\u201cunresolved and therefore not of final record.\u201d He reasserted this position in his response\nto the FORM, along with the additional claim that in his opinion \u201cuntil such time full\nresolution has been accomplished they are not of final record.\u201d     \n \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F (financial\nconsiderations) and Guideline E (personal conduct), with their disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions, are most relevant in this case. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n3\n4\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,5\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\n\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (December 19, 2002) at p. 3 (citations omitted).\n6\n ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 2.\n7\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at pp. 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n8\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n9\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n10\n Id. at 531.\n11\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n12\n7\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n6\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n7\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n8\nclearance decision.9\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n10\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n11\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n12\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .\n(Adjudicative Guideline [AG] 18)\nApplicant\u2019s June and November 2008 CBRs disclose 12 delinquent accounts, owing\nin the total amount of over $26,000, that have been submitted for collection, charged off\nas bad debts, or reported as being severely delinquent. Those CBRs and the statements\nand the documents Applicant submitted in response to the SOR, the FORM and the\ninterrogatories propounded to him by the Government clearly establish that the\nGovernment has met it\u2019s burden of proof and shown that Disqualifying Conditions (DC)\n19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and DC 19C(c): a history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations apply.\n On the other hand, Applicant failed to meet his burden to present evidence of\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him. An exhaustive\nreview of Applicant\u2019s assertions and the evidence he submitted fails to prove he has\nsatisfied any of the debts listed in the SOR. While some of the documents he submitted\n\n8\nmay or may not relate to specified debts as he alleges, there is no record evidence that\npermits a definitive conclusion they relate to those debts. Further, and most compelling,\nis that even if they do relate to the debts as alleged by Applicant, the record is devoid of\nevidence from which a conclusion can be reached that those debts have been satisfied.\nAs a result, Mitigating Condition (MC) 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts does not apply.  \nAs to the medical debts, Applicant repeatedly asserted he was in dispute with\ninsurance carriers over those debts. However, the documentary evidence he submitted in\nconnection with those debts generally established that the insurance company had paid\nthe majority of the debts leaving comparatively small portions of the debt to be paid by\nApplicant. There is nothing in the record to provide any basis for concluding the insurance\ncompany did not pay the amount of the debts it was contractually obligated to pay.\nApplicant also disputed the largest debt that resulted from a repossessed automobile, but\nhe failed to provide any documentation in support of his claims, including evidence that he\nhad retained legal counsel to dispute the claim as he asserted in his response to the\nFORM. Thus, MC 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to\nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue\ndoes not apply.\nApplicant attributes the financial problems evidenced by the delinquent debts to a\nmedical emergency and loss of employment. While the record clearly establishes his wife\nexperienced some serious medical problem in or about early-2003, and that he may also\nhave had some medical issues about that time, there is no record evidence other than\ndelinquent medical bills to indicate how this affected his ability to remain current on his\naccounts. As to the loss of employment, the e-QIP Applicant submitted indicates he has\nbeen continuously employed since at least June 2001. Additionally, the large assets and\nthe amount of discretionary income Applicant claimed in the personal financial statement\nhe submitted indicates he has the ability to satisfy all listed delinquent accounts when and\nif he so chooses. Therefore, MC 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem\nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances does not apply.\nFinally, there is no record evidence from which to find that  either of the remaining\npotentially applicable mitigating conditions, i.e., MC 20(a): the behavior . . . occurred under\nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; or MC 20(c): the person has received\nor is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the\nproblem is being resolved or is under control apply.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is\n\n9\nany failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process\nor any failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nIn response to applicable questions contained in the e-QIP he submitted in May\n2008, Applicant failed to disclose, as required, that he had been over 180 days delinquent\non any debt in the preceding seven years or that he was then currently over 90 days\ndelinquent on any debt. His June and November 2008 CBRs disclose he had numerous\naccounts that should have been disclosed in response to those questions, most dating\nback several years. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant asserted that because he had \u201congoing\ncommunication of settlement offers\u201d from some creditors he did not deem the accounts to\nbe delinquent. The settlement offers he attached to his response to interrogatories were\nsent to him by a few of his creditors between January 2006 and March 2007. His assertion\nto the effect that all of his delinquent accounts, most of which had been delinquent for\nyears, somehow in his mind became no longer delinquent because a few of his delinquent\ncreditors made settlement offers which he chose to ignore is not credible.\nIn his response to interrogatories, Applicant claimed he did not disclose the\naccounts because he considered them \u201cunresolved and therefore not of final record.\u201d He\nessentially reasserted this last justification in his response to the FORM. Applicant\u2019s failure\nto resolve his accounts and to instead permit them to remain in a collection status for years\ncan hardly be considered a basis for asserting that they are not delinquent. Like his\nresponse to the SOR, these attempted justifications are not credible. \n    \nAccordingly, DC 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant\nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form\nused to conduct investigations, determine qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities\napplies. I have considered all potential mitigating conditions and conclude that none apply.\nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\ntheir acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and\nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has failed to mitigate\nthe financial considerations and personal conduct security concerns. He has not overcome\nthe case against him nor satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. It is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Guidelines F\nand E are decided against Applicant. \n\n10\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-l:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a & b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n\n",

The admissions are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 42 years old and has worked for a federal contractor for approximately 17 months as a field service engineer. He is a divorced father of two children, ages 18 and 17. He has consistently paid child support and financially supports his children with additional funds as needed and when affordable.1 Applicant worked for a federal agency as a contractor overseas from 1992 to 2003. He started two businesses in 2003 to 2004. Both businesses were located in a recreational area with a man-made lake that was near a dam. The area catered to tourism. Both businesses made modest profits until a leak was found in the dam in 2005, which required it to significantly lower its water level to prevent flooding. This reduced the recreational opportunities associated with the dam, which in turn affected tourism and all of the businesses in the area, including Applicant\u2019s two stores. In 2006, the water level was reduced again, which had a devastating impact on Applicant\u2019s stores and the surrounding businesses. Applicant paid the bills associated with the stores, such as those to suppliers, rent, utilities, and his employees, but was unable to keep up with other ",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \nOn December 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuidelines F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 10, 2009. He later requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 10, \n2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 17, 2009. I convened the hearing \nas scheduled on March 10, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8. \nApplicant did not object and they were admitted. The Government also submitted a \n \n1 \n \n \nMarch 23, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \ndemonstrative exhibit that was marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I.

The record remained open until March 19, 2009, to allow Applicant to submit \nadditional evidence, which he did. They were marked as AE J though P. Department \nCounsel had no objections and they was admitted and the record closed. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 17, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted allegations 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1, e, 1. g, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.l and 1.n, \nof the SOR and denied the remaining allegations. The admissions are incorporated \nherein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 42 years old and has worked for a federal contractor for \napproximately 17 months as a field service engineer. He is a divorced father of two \nchildren, ages 18 and 17. He has consistently paid child support and financially \nsupports his children with additional funds as needed and when affordable.1  \n \nApplicant worked for a federal agency as a contractor overseas from 1992 to \n2003. He started two businesses in 2003 to 2004. Both businesses were located in a \nrecreational area with a man-made lake that was near a dam. The area catered to \ntourism. Both businesses made modest profits until a leak was found in the dam in \n2005, which required it to significantly lower its water level to prevent flooding. This \nreduced the recreational opportunities associated with the dam, which in turn affected \ntourism and all of the businesses in the area, including Applicant\u2019s two stores. In 2006, \nthe water level was reduced again, which had a devastating impact on Applicant\u2019s \nstores and the surrounding businesses. Applicant paid the bills associated with the \nstores, such as those to suppliers, rent, utilities, and his employees, but was unable to \nkeep up with other debts. During the later stage of the depressed economy he went \nfrom a gross monthly income of $9,000 to $1,500 in 30 days. By the end of 2005, \nApplicant took on a second job to help pay the bills. He was finally forced to close the \nstores in 2007. Applicant was unemployed for approximately six weeks before being \nhired at his present job 2007.2 \n \nApplicant did not have health insurance for a period of time and he needed \nmedical attention, which further impacted his financial situation.  \n \nApplicant has been paying off his delinquent debts since becoming employed. He \npaid the remaining balance on his car in early 2008. He repaid a business and personal \nloan in February and May 2008. He also paid a credit card debt.3  \n \n1 Tr. 35-37; AE K. \n \n2 Tr. 23-38, 46-47, 50. \n \n3 Tr. 24, 80; AE N. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant made a chart of his finances which lists his debts and a plan to pay off \nthe remaining debts. He is systematically paying off his debts. His chart shows debts \nthat he has already paid that were not included in the SOR. He is reluctant to agree to a \npayment plan with certain creditors due to the uncertainty of his present job and ability \nto pay his remaining debts. He does not want to start a plan that he cannot complete, so \nhe is saving the remainder of his monthly income and will then tackle the debts he can \npay. When he knows his job is secure he will readily enter payment plans.4  \n \nApplicant had credit cards that originally had low balances, but when his \nbusinesses failed he was unable to make the minimum payments and the balances \nescalated.  \n \nApplicant has two state tax liens and a civil judgment for state taxes owed. These \ntax debts are from his business for sales and use taxes. There was some confusion \nabout the tax that was due in December 2004 and Applicant readily admitted he was \nlate in paying the tax, which caused penalties and interest to be incurred. He was \nunaware of the additional amounts until six months after the infraction. He admitted he \nwas late on other occasions and had difficulty paying the taxes. He stated the debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c do not reflect the payments he made and the state will not \nremove the liens until all back taxes are paid. He asserted that the total amount he \nowes is $10,427. Applicant also received a $760 refund from the state which will be \napplied to his current debt.5 Applicant has no other tax debts.6 \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d ($1,554) is a credit card debt that became delinquent in \nJune 2007. The account was sold several times. Applicant contacted the current \ncreditor, but Applicant could not comply with their repayment plan offer at this time.7  \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e ($1,215) is a credit card debt that went delinquent in \nOctober 2007. Applicant contacted the creditor and the debt has been sold again. He \nhas not contacted the current creditor.8 \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f ($914) is a credit card debt. Applicant stated it is the same \ndebt as in SOR \u00b6 1.k. The balance is approximately $1,000. Applicant has a payment \nplan and has made three payments of $75.67. New monthly payments will be paid \nthrough an automatic withdrawal from Applicant\u2019s bank.9 \n \n4 Tr. 63; AE N.. \n \n5 GE 2. \n \n6 Tr. 42-54; AE O. \n \n7 Tr. 54-56. \n \n8 Tr. 56-57. \n \n9 Tr. 38-41, 58, 65; AE B. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g ($210) became delinquent in 2005. The original creditor \nwas a jewelry store where he made a purchase in 2004 before his business problems. \nThe creditor has since filed for bankruptcy and the debt was sold to a different creditor. \nApplicant has attempted to determine the current creditor without success.10  \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h ($520) is a credit card debt. Applicant tried numerous \ntimes to determine the collection company. He attempted to pay the original creditor but \nthey refused payment because the debt had been sold. He learned three days prior to \nthe hearing there was yet another collection company. No further arrangements have \nbeen made.11  \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i ($950) is a department store credit card. It has been \ndelinquent since 2007 and no recent payments have been made. Applicant believes this \nis the same debt as in SOR \u00b6 1.m because he only had one credit card with that store.12 \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j ($702) is a store credit card debt that was incurred in 2006. \nApplicant paid $380 to the collection company to make the debt current, but then fell \nbehind again. He has not made recent payments on the debt.13  \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.l ($1,307) is a store credit card debt. Applicant has not \nmade payments on the debt.14 \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.n ($981) is for medical services when Applicant did not have \nhealth insurance. Applicant has arranged a payment plan to begin next week. He will \npay $140 a month toward this debt. Another medical debt from the same creditor is \nincluded in this payment plan. The other debt is not alleged in the SOR.15 \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.o is a medical debt that Applicant settled for $385. It was \nincurred for a hospital bill when Applicant did not have health insurance.16 \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.p is a medical debt that Applicant incurred while he did not \nhave health insurance. The debt is paid.17 \n \n10 Tr. 58-61. \n \n11 Tr. 61-63. \n \n12 Tr. 64, 66-67. \n \n13 Tr. 64-65. \n \n14 Tr. 65-66. \n \n15 Tr. 67-68. \n \n16 Tr. 69-70; AE E. \n \n17 Tr. 70-71; GE 2 at p. 62.  \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nPrior to Applicant\u2019s business venture, he always paid his bills on time. He \nexplained his failure to pay his debts was because he did not have the money. He was \nusing what money he had to pay his business debts. He estimated that he will have all \nof his delinquent debts paid in approximately 18 months. If he stays employed, he will \nbe deployed overseas and his income will increase, thereby accelerating his payment \nschedule. Applicant estimated he has $600 to $700 remaining at the end of each month \nafter paying his expenses. He takes the remainder and either applies it toward a small \ndebt to resolve it, or saves it so he has enough to resolve another debt after he has \nsaved enough money. He maintains about $800 in savings for emergencies, such as \nauto repairs. Applicant recently received a raise from his employer which will help him \nresolve his debts.18 \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor provided a character letter on his behalf. He believes \nApplicant to be a valuable asset to the company. He has a superb work ethic and is \ndedicated to performing all of his assigned tasks.19  \n \nA former supervisor attested to Applicant\u2019s professional leadership ability, calm \ntemperament when under pressure and ability to accept and complete any task given \nhim with outstanding results. He exhibited a steadfast attitude and devotion to duty. He \nwas considered a huge asset.20 \n \nA fellow worker also provided a character letter. He believes Applicant is \nextremely cooperative with a desire to do quality work in a timely fashion.21 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n \n18 Tr. 63, 72-90; AE M and P.  \n \n19 AE A. \n \n20 AE L. \n \n21 AE B. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 19 and especially considered: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nAppellant has delinquent debts that began accruing in when his businesses start \nto fail in 2005 and, remain unpaid because of his failed businesses and loss of income. \nHe is still resolving those debts. Therefore, I find both disqualifying conditions apply.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered the following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior is recent because he has delinquent debts that remain \nunpaid. His conduct casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. I \nfind (a) does not apply. In the past Applicant paid his bills on time. When he started two \nbusinesses that eventually failed due to the downturn in the tourist business he had \ndifficulty paying his bills. He also needed medical services during a time he did not have \nhealth insurances. These were circumstances beyond his control. For (b) to fully apply \nhe must have also acted responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant focused on \npaying his business debts and his employees. He took a second job to keep paying his \nbills. Unfortunately, he could not keep up with the debts. I find under the circumstances \nthat he acted responsibly by ensuring his business creditors were paid, his employees \nwere paid and paying off his small debts. Therefore, I find (b) applies. There is no \nevidence Applicant has received any financial counseling. Applicant has set up payment \nplans and is paying off some of his debts. He is only taking on those debts that he \nknows at this juncture he can reasonable pay, considering his job is in jeopardy. I find it \n\n \n8 \n \n \nreasonable that he does not want to enter a payment plan if he knows he can not \nmaintain it. Saving his money until he can pay off each debt, under the circumstances is \nreasonable. If he keeps his job he will enter into payment plans and attempt to \naccelerate his payments. I find Applicant is making a good-faith effort to repay his \ncreditors and there are indications the problems are being resolved. Hence I find (c) and \n(d) apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant consistently paid his bills \nin the past. He consistently pays his child support. He began having financial problems \nwhen, due to conditions beyond his control, the tourism declined and it affected the \neconomy where his businesses were located. He did his best to pay his business \ncreditors and employees, but unfortunately at the expense of his personal debts. \nApplicant has a systematic plan for paying all of his remaining debt. Although he has \nsignificant personal debt that is delinquent, he has not abandoned it. This is not a case \nof Applicant walking away from his debt. He realizes making an agreement to repay a \ncreditor and then defaulting, if he loses his job, is not acting in good faith. He instead \nhas chosen to pay what he can, and save money so he can reasonably resolve the \nremaining debts in the future. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions \nor doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant successfully mitigated the security concerns arising from \nfinancial considerations.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.p: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly within the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nSeptember 21, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nOn February 6, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nF and E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (RSOR), in writing on February 23, 2009, and\nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to this\nAdministrative Judge on April 6, 2009. DOHA initially issued a notice of hearing on April\n6, 2009, and the hearing was scheduled to be heard on April 29, 2009, in Las Vegas,\nNevada. At the request of Applicant, the hearing was rescheduled in Reno, Nevada, for\nJune 17, 2009. Applicant thereafter requested another continuance until after June,\nwhen she would return from Iraq. On July 6, 2009, a third notice of hearing was issued,\nand the hearing finally convened on August 14, 2009, in Las Vegas, Nevada. \n\n2\nThe Government offered Exhibits 1 through 6, which were received without\nobjection. Applicant testified on her own behalf, and she submitted Exhibits A through J,\nwhich were entered into evidence without objection. Two additional witnesses testified\non behalf of Applicant. The transcript (Tr) was received on August 20, 2009.  \nI granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until August 28, 2009, to\nsubmit additional matters.  She timely submitted four additional documents that have\nbeen entered into evidence without objection as Exhibits K through N. Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant\nand the other witnesses, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact: \nApplicant is 43 years old. She served in the U.S. Army from 1983 to 1991. She is\nemployed by a defense contractor, and she seeks a DoD security clearance in\nconnection with her employment in the defense sector.\nThis SOR had a number of mistakes that have been amended to make the\nappropriate corrections, and will be revealed as they are reviewed in this decision. First,\nthe name that is listed on the SOR is backwards, in that the first name is listed first,\nrather than last as is proper. I have amended and corrected it so the last name is listed\nfirst, consistent with DOHA procedures. \nParagraph 1 Guideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe SOR lists 18 allegations of overdue debts, and two allegations regarding\nbankruptcy, under Adjudicative Guideline F. The SOR has two 1.f and 1.g. allegations,\nso the SOR goes from 1.a. through 1.g, and then starts with 1.f. through 1.t. The second\n1.f. and 1.g. allegations will be identified as 1.f.(2) and 1.g.(2). Also there is no 1.p.\nallegation listed in the SOR, so none will be addressed in this decision. All of the\nallegations will be discussed in the same order as they were listed in the SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $9,259 for a medical\nbill. At the hearing, Applicant testified that this medical bill was incurred because of\ntreatment she received in a hospital, and she believed that it should have been paid by\nher Veterans Administration (VA) health coverage, but thus far it has not been paid (Tr\nat 40-43). Exhibit N is a letter from a Regional Representative of one of Applicant\u2019s U.S.\nSenators, dated August 26, 2009, who indicated that he has submitted an inquiry to the\nVA regarding this debt for a medical claim after it was initially denied, and he is awaiting\na response. Unless the VA reverses its earlier ruling,  the debt is still owed. \n\n3\n1.b. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $36 for a medical bill.\nApplicant testified that she believed that this debt should have been paid by the VA, but\nthus far it has been denied. She also indicated that she thought she might have made a\npayment on this debt, so the record remained open to offer evidence of payment of this\ndebt. No evidence was submitted to show this debt has been paid (Tr at 45).\n1.c. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $44 for a medical bill.\nApplicant testified that she believed that this debt should also have been paid by the\nVA, but thus far it has been denied. No evidence was submitted to show this debt has\nbeen paid.\n1.d. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $458 for a medical\nbill. . Applicant testified that she believed that this debt should also have been paid by\nthe VA, but thus far it has been denied. No evidence was submitted to show this debt\nhas been paid.\n1.e. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $4,183.  Applicant\ntestified that she has not paid this debt (Tr at 49).\n1.f. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $710. Exhibit F, the\nmost current credit report, dated August 5, 2009, shows that this debt has been\nresolved. \n1.g. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $498. Unfortunately,\nit was not discovered at the hearing that there were two allegations of 1.f. and 1.g., so\nonly one of each was addressed. This debt was not reviewed at the hearing, but Exhibit\n6 shows that Applicant is disputing this debt. Exhibit L, a credit report, dated August 24,\n2009, shows that this debt has been deleted. \n1.f.(2) This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $6,195. This debt\nwas also not reviewed at the hearing, but Exhibit 6 shows that this debt was paid. \n1.g.(2) This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $444. Applicant\ntestified that she still owes this debt. She is in the process of making some kind of\npayment arrangement with this creditor, although no agreement has yet been reached\n(Tr at 49).\n1.h. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $4,183. I find that this\nis the same debt as 1.e., above, and it has been reviewed above. \n1.i. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $4,183. I find that this\nis the same debt as 1.e. and 1.h., above, and it has been reviewed above. \n1.j. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $595. Applicant\ntestified that she has not made a payment on this debt, but she is disputing it (Tr at 51-\n52). Exhibit 6 shows that this debt is still outstanding, but it does not show that it is\nbeing disputed. I find that this debt is still owed. \n\n4\n1.k. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $2,510. Applicant\ntestified that she has resolved this debt. After reviewing Exhibit 3, page 12, and Exhibit\nH, this debt has been moved to different collection agencies, but it appears that it has\nbeen resolved. \n1.l. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $565. Applicant\ntestified that she has not made a payment on this debt, but she is disputing it (Tr at 55-\n56). Exhibit 6 shows that this debt is still outstanding, but it does not show that it is\nbeing disputed. I find that this debt is still owed. \n1.m. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $5,578. Applicant\nacknowledged that she owes this debt, but she has not yet made a payment\narrangement, although she expects the debt to be significantly reduced (Tr at 56-59). \n1.n. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $2,797. The credit\nreport dated August 5, 2009, shows that this debt has been resolved (Exhibit F).\n1.o. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $9,259. I find that this\nis the same debt as 1.a., above, and it has been reviewed above. \n1.q. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $503. The credit\nreport dated August 5, 2009, shows that this debt has been resolved (Exhibit F).\n1.r. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $498. Applicant\ntestified that she had disputed this bill. Upon review, I find that this is the same debt as\n1.g., above, and it has been reviewed. \n1.s. The SOR alleges that in May 2000, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy\nin the Unites States Bankruptcy Court. Applicant testified that she filed bankruptcy to\ndischarge all of her debts, except her home mortgage and an automobile loan, on both\nof which she continued making payments. She had financial problems at that time,\nbecause she went through a period when she was a full time student, as a result of\nwhich she had to resign her employment and relocate (Tr at 63-64).\n1.t. The SOR alleges that in October 2006, the petition, that Applicant filed for\nChapter 7 bankruptcy in the Unites States Bankruptcy Court, was discharged. Applicant\ntestified that she only filed for that was alleged in 1.s., above. Based on the evidence\nintroduced at the hearing, which showed that the date of October 2006 was in error, the\nSOR was amended to the correct date that Applicant\u2019s debts were discharged in\nbankruptcy, which was August 2000 not October 2006. \nParagraph 2 Guideline E, Personal Conduct\n2.a.  The SOR alleged that Applicant \u201cdid not list that [her] security clearance and\nSCI access was (sic) revoked before been (sic) terminated from the U.S. Army on April\n1, 1991.\u201d The SOR does not identify where Applicant failed to list this information, but\nthe assumption is that it was in the SCA. \n\n5\nApplicant testified that she did not believe her security clearance or SCI access\nwere terminated, because when she was completing her SCA, she had her security\nmanager run her background through the Government computer, and it returned a\nresponse of \u201cundetermined\u201d regarding her security status. It is her belief that her\nsecurity clearance was never \u201crevoked, terminated or suspended.\u201d  (Tr at 67). I do not\nfind that the Government established that Applicant knowingly furnished false\ninformation on the SCA, regarding her previous security clearance status.\n2.b.\nThe SOR listed this second allegation under Guideline 2 as also 2.a., so it\nwas amended to be 2.b. The SOR alleged that Applicant responded \"No\" to: Section 28:\na., of a Security Clearance Application (SCA) that Applicant executed on January 9,\n2008 (Exhibit 1), which asks, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days\ndelinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to this question, and she failed to\nlist any debts. The SOR alleges that Applicant should have disclosed the debts listed as\n1.a., through 1.t. Clearly 1.s. and 1.t. are not debts, so they should not have not been\ndisclosed, but at least some of Applicant\u2019s debts should have been listed on the SCA, in\nresponse to 28.a.\nApplicant testified that at the time she completed the SCA. she had not reviewed\na credit report, so she was not aware what her financial status was regarding overdue\ndebts. Applicant submitted Exhibit J, which was her handwritten SCA. In response to\nquestion 28:a., she initially wrote \u201cYes\u201d and then it appears that she put a line through it\nand answered \u201cNo\u201d. When asked to list the names and addresses of creditors, she\nwrote \u201cunclear at this time unemployment and relocation.\u201d Applicant stated that she\ninitially answered yes, but after she had a further discussion with her security manager,\nshe decided that \u201cif [she] didn\u2019t know, that [she] should go ahead and answer \u2018No.\u2019\u201d (Tr\nat 73).\nUpon further questioning about why Applicant answered no to question 28.a.,\nshe could give no definitive reason for why she failed to identify on the SCA, at a\nminimum, that she had overdue debts, even if she did not know all of them or to whom\nthey were owed (Tr at 92-94).  Applicant testified that she previously completed SCAs in\n1983 and 1988. Based on her lack of an explanation for her failure to identify on her\nSCA that she even had any overdue debts, and the fact that she had two previous\nexperiences competing security applications, I do not find Applicant credible that she did\nnot intend to mislead the Government in her response to Questions 28: a.\nAlso, while it was not alleged on the SOR, I have noted that Applicant responded\n\"No\" to Section 28: b., of the SCA, which asks, \u201cAre you currently over 90 days\ndelinquent on any debt(s)?\" She also failed to list any debts. I find that Applicant should\nhave identified the same debts in response to this question. \nApplicant testified that after her debts were discharged in bankruptcy in 2000,\nshe \u201ccleaned up her act\u201d until 2004, when she incurred the majority of her debt. Her\nmother became ill with cancer, and she resigned her job and moved to another state to\nbe with her. At that time she attempted to operate a landscape business, and it was not\nas successful as Applicant had hoped it would be. Applicant was also in a domestic\n\n6\npartnership with another individual, and this led to financial difficulties including alleged\nidentity theft of Applicant\u2019s credit cards by this person (Tr at 76-79). \nApplicant testified that currently she has sufficient income at the end of the month\nto pay off the SOR debts that have not yet been resolved (Tr at 88-89), but no evidence\nwas submitted to establish the status of Applicant\u2019s current financial situation. \nTwo witnesses testified in very positive terms on behalf of Applicant, describing\nApplicant as \u201cpatriotic\u201d with \u201ca very good character\u201d (Tr at 26-38). Additionally, Applicant\nsubmitted four letters, three from individuals who have known Applicant either in an\nemployment or personal capacity (Exhibits D and K). The three  letters were very\npositive, describing Applicant as \u201ccaring and giving\u201d and having \u201cstrong core values and\nintegrity.\u201d The fourth letter was from the Facility Security Officer of Applicant\u2019s current\nemployer, dated August 24, 2009, in which he stated that he felt that Applicant \u201cdid not\nintentionally exclude information from her security clearance questionnaire. In speaking\nwith [Applicant] through the questionnaire process, she felt that all of her answers were\nto the best of her knowledge at the time of submission.\u201d\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.   \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\n\n7\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government has established that Applicant has had a history of financial\ndifficulties and overdue debts.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nAG \u00b6 19 (a), \u201can inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG \u00b6  19 (c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt and has been\nunable to pay her obligations for a considerable period of time. The evidence is\nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nUnder AG \u00b6  20 (b), it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d As noted above,\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were largely because of the illness of her mother, the lack\nof success of her business, and the alleged identity theft by her former domestic\npartner. She also has been responsible by making some attempts to resolve her\noverdue debts. However, since Applicant has had a history of financial difficulties\nincluding a bankruptcy in 2000 and accumulating significant debts thereafter, and there\nwas no  evidence introduced to establish that Applicant\u2019s current fiances are stable, I\ndo not find that this potentially mitigating condition is sufficient to minimize the\nGovernment\u2019s concern with Applicant\u2019s financial situation.  I resolve Guideline F against\nApplicant.\n\n8\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nWith respect to Guideline E, I find that the Government has not established that\nApplicant knowingly provided incorrect material information to the Government,\nregarding her previous security clearance status.\nHowever, I do not find that Applicant testified credibly that she did not knowingly\nprovide incorrect material information to the Government on the SCA regarding her\noverdue debts. While I note the letter submitted by the Facility Security Officer (Exhibit\nK), in which he indicated that he did not believe Applicant would intentionally exclude\ninformation from her SCA, I find that Applicant clearly was aware that she had overdue\ndebts, and I can find no reasonable explanation for her failure to identify, in any way,\nthat she had debts that were overdue for more than 180 days. \nIn reviewing the DCs under Guideline E,  I conclude that DC15 (a) \u201cdeliberate\nomission, concealment, of falsification of relevant material facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire\u201d applies against Applicant. I do not find that any MC applies\nunder this guideline.  I therefore, resolve Guideline E against Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuidelines F and E, in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nBased on all of the reasons cited above regarding Applicant\u2019s history of overdue debts,\nand her failure to furnish accurate information about her debts, I find that the record\nevidence leaves me with significant questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and\nsuitability for a security clearance under the whole person concept. For all these\nreasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns. \n\n9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.f, g, f(2), h, i, k, n, o, q, r:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.a -.e, g,(2), j, l, m, s, t:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT The following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, the testimony and the exhibits. The Applicant is 47 years old, completed the twelfth grade, but did not graduate. She is employed by a defense contractor as a Computer Operator and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with her employment. The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR.) After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, the following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR: 3 Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations) The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for a security clearance because she is financially overextended and at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The Applicant admits each of the delinquent debts set forth in the SOR under this guideline that include unpaid debts totaling in excess of $50,000. Although the debts set forth in allegations 1(o), 1(p), and 1(q) are not familiar to her, she acknowledges that they are reflected in her credit report. Credit Reports of the Applicant dated March 18, 2008, June 3, 2009, December 3, 2009, March 16, 2010, and May 4, 2010, collectively reflect each of the delinquent debts set forth in the SOR.

Howry, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nAugust 20, 2010\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) dated February 20, 2008.  (Government Exhibit 1.)  On June 25, 2009, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865\n(as amended), and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January\n2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the\nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative\nJudge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on July 20, 2009, and she requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to another\nAdministrative Judge on January 11, 2010, and a hearing was held on March 18, 2010.\nAt that hearing the Government presented seven exhibits referred to as Government\nExhibits 1 through 7, which were admitted into evidence without objection.  The\nApplicant requested that the hearing be continued as she was not prepared to present\n\n2\nher case.  The matter was continued, and re-assigned to the undersigned\nAdministrative Judge on March 26, 2010.  A notice of hearing was issued on April 2,\n2010, scheduling the hearing for May 14, 2010.  At the hearing, the Government\npresented one additional exhibit referred to as Government Exhibit 8, which was\nadmitted without objection.  The Applicant presented nine exhibits, referred to as\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A through I, which were admitted without objection.  The Applicant\nalso testified on her own behalf.  The record remained open until close of business on\nMay 24, 2010, to allow the Applicant to submit additional documentation.  The Applicant\nsubmitted six Post-Hearing Exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits 1\nthrough 6.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on May 20, 2010.  Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted.\nPROCEDURAL MATTERS\nThe Government, through Department Counsel, filed a Notice of Amendment to\nthe Statement of Reasons on a date uncertain, to include five additional allegations,\nnamely subparagraphs 1(o) through 1(s).  The Applicant had no objection to said\namendment.  Allegations 1(o) through 1(s) include a debt owed to a creditor for a\ndelinquent credit card in the amount of $1,151.00; a debt owed to a creditor for a\ndelinquent credit card in the amount of $1,341.00; a debt owed to a creditor in the\namount of $5,522.00; a debt owed to a creditor in the amount of the amount of\n$13,977.00; and a debt owed to a creditor for a mortgage on a house in the amount of\n$392,000.  They are hereby incorporated into the original Statement of Reasons.  \n    \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nthe testimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 47 years old, completed the twelfth\ngrade, but did not graduate.  She is employed by a defense contractor as a Computer\nOperator and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with her\nemployment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR.)  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\n\n3\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because she is financially overextended\nand at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n \nThe Applicant admits each of the delinquent debts set forth in the SOR under this\nguideline that include unpaid debts totaling in excess of $50,000.  Although the debts\nset forth in allegations 1(o), 1(p), and 1(q) are not familiar to her, she acknowledges that\nthey are reflected in her credit report.  Credit Reports of the Applicant dated March 18,\n2008, June 3, 2009, December 3, 2009, March 16, 2010, and May 4, 2010, collectively\nreflect each of the delinquent debts set forth in the SOR.  (Government Exhibits 4, 5 , 6,\n7 and 8).\n  \nAfter finishing high school, the Applicant got married and had four children.\nAlthough she worked off and on, she was a stay at home mother most of the time.  (Tr.\np. 27).  In 1992, her husband, who worked in construction, had little or no work.  As a\nresult, they fell behind on their bills, had to file for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, and\ndischarged approximately $12,000.  (Government Exhibit 2).  As the economy\nimproved, in 1994-95, she and her husband built a tile contracting business together\nthat allowed her to work out of her home and still take care of the children.  He did the\ntile work, while she did all of the paperwork, including setting up the business,\nincorporating it, payroll, insurance, employee matters, etc.  Business was good and they\nwere able to buy a house. At that time, they had excellent credit and twenty employees.\n(Tr. p. 30).    \nAs time passed, her husband\u2019s spending habits became frivolous and\nirresponsible, even though the economy was on a downturn and their business was\nsuffering.  This caused serious marital conflict, negatively effected their credit, and\neventually led to their separation.  In 2005, the Applicant and her husband separated.\nHe quit his job, and stopped making the house payment.  (Tr. p. 32).  By this time they\nhad refinanced the house they had originally bought for $140,000 up to $500,000.  The\nhouse was eventually foreclosed upon.  To try and make ends meet and to support her\nchildren, the Applicant started working as a waitress, and in 2007, she worked three\njobs at one time  to support her family.  \nIn 2007, she was offered a temporary position with her current employer that\nlater became permanent.  When she was hired, and was told that she had to apply for a\nsecurity clearance, she told her supervisor that she had financial indebtedness that had\nnot been resolved.  (Tr. p. 31).  She planned on filing bankruptcy but had to save the\nmoney to do so.  It took two years before she had the money to file for bankruptcy.  (Tr.\np. 31).  After twenty-two years of marriage, in February of this year, the Applicant filed\nfor divorce.  She was unable to file earlier due to financial hardship.  \nThe Applicant became indebted to the following creditors: a debt owed to a\ncreditor for a delinquent credit card in the amount of $3,901.00; a debt owed to a bank\nin the amount of $9,172.00; a debt owed to a bank in the amount of $7,073.00; a debt\nowed to a creditor in the amount of $5,116.00; a debt owed to a creditor in the amount\n\n4\nof $962.00; a debt owed to a creditor in the amount of $674.00; and a debt owed to a\ncreditor in the amount of $1,765.00.\nShe also had a debt owed to a creditor in the amount of $7,544.00; a debt owed\nto a creditor in the amount of $385.00; a debt owed to a creditor in the amount of\n$6,084.00, a debt owed to a creditor in the amount of $581.00; a debt owed to a creditor\nin the amount of $4,701.00; a debt owed to a creditor in the amount of $1,574.00; and a\ndebt owed to a creditor in the amount of $1,238.090.\nFinally, Applicant had a debt owed to a creditor for a delinquent credit card in the\namount of $1,151.00; a debt owed to a creditor for a delinquent credit card in the\namount of $1,341.00; a debt owed to a creditor in the amount of $5,522.00; a debt owed\nto a creditor in the amount of the amount of $13,977.00; and a debt owed to a creditor\nfor a mortgage on a house in the amount of $392,000.  \n          \nAlthough half of the debt alleged in the SOR is her husband\u2019s responsibility, he\nhas failed to pay it.  In an effort to resolve her indebtedness, on June 15, 2009, the\nApplicant filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy to discharge all of her delinquent debts that\ninclude each of the debts set forth in the SOR.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits E and F and Post-\nHearing Exhibits 4, 5 and 6).  Although some of the account numbers of her Schedule F\ndo not match those reflected on her credit reports, her attorney advises her that she\ndoes not owe any of the debt, and that in order to have them removed she must write\nthe three separate credit agencies and inform them that they are incorrectly reporting\ninformation on her credit report and send a copy of her schedule F showing that they\nwere listed in her bankruptcy and that they have been discharged.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-\nHearing Exhibit 6).   \nShe currently earns about $30,000 annually.  (Tr. p. 36).  She is moving out of\nher apartment and in with her mother to further reduce her expenses.  She is making\nevery effort to live within her means and is accumulating no new debt.  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit D).        \nLetters of recommendation from her supervisor, the company security manager,\nprofessional associates and friends of the Applicant, who know her in professional and\npersonal capacities, attest to her competency, knowledge, trustworthiness, and her\nhardworking, helpful and professional nature.  She is highly organized, has excellent\ncommunication skills and a great rapport with coworkers.  She is highly recommended\nfor a position of trust.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit H).  \n\n5\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n19(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n20(b) the condition that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstance;\n20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation;\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct;\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n\n6\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary;\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral\nchanges;\ng.  The motivation for the conduct; \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress; and \n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicated\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\ninstances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant her a security clearance.\n\n7\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with her security clearance eligibility.\nCircumstances largely beyond the Applicant\u2019s control, mainly the poor economy,\nresulted in the loss of her business, the loss of her marriage that is directly related to\nher financial hardship, and her poor credit standing.  For the past three years, however,\nshe had been working hard to climb out of the hole she fell into.  She has worked three\njobs to support herself and her children.  She has filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy to\ndischarge her delinquent debt, she dissolved the business, paid back the overdue taxes\nrelated to the business, filed for divorce, and taken full responsibility for her minor child.\nUnder the circumstances she has been prudent and exercised good judgment in an\neffort to resolve her debts.  She is moving out of her apartment and in with her mother\nto further reduce her expenses.  She has done everything humanly possible to repair\nthe past financial damage.  She is living within her means and currently demonstrates\nfinancial rehabilitation.  She has presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate a track\nrecord of financial responsibility and has resolved her financial indebtedness.\nThere is sufficient evidence of financial rehabilitation at this time.  Under\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19(a) inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts and 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations\napply.  However, Mitigating Conditions 20(b) the condition that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstance and, 20(d) the individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts also apply.  The\nApplicant has indeed made a good faith effort to repay her overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve her debts.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations.)  \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole-person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole-person assessment of good judgement, trustworthiness, reliability, candor, a\nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that\nthe person may properly safeguard classified information.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's\ncase opposing her request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports\na finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in\nParagraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.  \n     \n\n8\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nFor the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  1.i.:\nFor the Applicant.\n                         Subpara.  1.j.:\nFor the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  1.k.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.l.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.m.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.n.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.o.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.p.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.q.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.r.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.s.:\nFor the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \non (e-QIP), on March 27, 2008. On June 25, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005; and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after \nSeptember 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 28, 2009, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed \non August 11, 2009, and I received the case assignment on August 21, 2009. DOHA \nFebruary 17, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nissued a notice of hearing on August 21, 2009, scheduling the hearing for September \n25, 2009. The hearing was held as scheduled. \n \nThe government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6, which were \nreceived without objection. The Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through \nEE, which were received without objection, and he testified on his own behalf.  \n \nI held the record open to afford the Applicant the opportunity to submit \nadditional documents on his behalf. Applicant submitted an e-mail dated October 6, \n2009 with numerous attachments, collectively marked as AE FF, which was received \nwithout objection. On October 6, 2009, Applicant\u2019s personal representative submitted \na \u201ccover letter\u201d on behalf of Applicant marked as AE GG, which was received without \nobjection. On January 29, 2010, Applicant\u2019s immediate supervisor submitted a letter \non behalf of Applicant, marked as AE HH, which was received without objection. On \nFebruary 13, 2010, Applicant submitted additional material to include a current budget, \nmarked as AE II, which was received without objection. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on October 5, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations contained in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \u2013 1.c. with \nexplanations, and denied those allegations contained in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d. \u2013 1.g. with \nexplanations. His admissions and denials with explanations are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 61-year-old training developer, who has worked for his defense \ncontractor employer since December 2007. GE 2, Tr. 41. Applicant testified that he \nhas successfully held a security clearance since 1998. Tr. 39-40. Applicant seeks to \nrenew his secret clearance and indicated his future duties may require him to have a \ntop secret clearance. Tr. 50-52. \n \nApplicant attended college from September 1967 to June 1971, and was \nawarded a Bachelor of Arts Degree in International Relations in June 1971. GE 2, Tr, \n40. He attended a university from May 1999 (estimated) to April 2000 (estimated) and \n\u201cpartially completed\u201d the requirements for a Master\u2019s Degree in Computer Science. GE \n2, Tr. 40-41. \n \nApplicant was previously married from 1972 to 1977. That marriage ended by \ndivorce. Applicant remarried in June 1980. He has a 26-year-old daughter, a 36-year-\nold stepdaughter, and a 38-year-old stepson. GE 2, Tr. 46-49. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed his financial situation and \nincluded the review of his March 2008 e-QIP; and his April 2008, February 2009 and \nAugust 2009 credit reports. GE 2-5.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR identified seven separate collection accounts totaling $65,343.  \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \u2013 1.g.) SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a.-1.c. are student loans that Applicant incurred on \nbehalf of his daughter. They were alleged as three separate debts; i.e. $13,000, \n$12,000, and $10,000. Applicant fell behind on his payments due to illness, discussed \ninfra. He consolidated these loans in late 2008, and had made seven of nine monthly \npayments towards \u201csuccessful rehabilitation\u201d of these loans by the time the hearing \ncommenced. Applicant makes these payments by direct debit. AE A \u2013 AE D, Tr. 52-\n57. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d. and 1.f. are collection accounts in the respective amounts of \n$9,000 and $13,144. Applicant has been unable to ascertain with any degree of \nreasonable certainty the source of these debts and has used the contact information \ncontained in the credit reports provided to him by Department Counsel before the \nhearing.  \n \nAdditionally, Applicant consulted with an attorney in January 2009, and later \nhired him to assist him in ascertaining the identity of these two creditors and with \nissues regarding his credit report. Applicant\u2019s attorney stated once he determined the \nowners of these accounts, he would enter into settlement agreements with these \ncreditors. Additionally, this same attorney referred him to a credit counseling service, \nwhich Applicant utilized, to assist him in budgeting and money management issues. \nThis credit counseling service is bankruptcy court-approved. AE GG, GE 3, Tr. 57-64, \n84. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e. is a collection account for $7,693. In July 2009, Applicant settled \nthis account for a lesser amount and has been making monthly payments by direct \ndebit since then. Tr. 64-71, AE E, AE DD, GE 5. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g. is a collection account for $506. Applicant paid that account in full \nby direct debit in August 2009. Tr. 77-79, AE F. \n \nFrom August 2005 to December 2007, Applicant accepted a position and took \nup residence teaching English at a university in Mexico. He estimates his salary was \n$6,500 in 2005, $18,000 in 2006, and $18,100 in 2007. Applicant was unable to obtain \nMexican health care insurance because of his weight and high blood pressure. During \nhis time in Mexico, Applicant and his wife sustained several uncovered medical \nproblems, discussed infra. Tr. 79-81, AE GG. \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife was bedridden for approximately three months after she \nsustained a severe back injury (collapsed spine). Applicant was hospitalized three \n\n \n4 \n \n \ntimes for cancer-related treatment. Tr. 80-81. With Applicant\u2019s reduced salary and \nuncovered medical bills, he fell behind on his debts. Tr. 81. In December 2007, \nApplicant made the decision to return to the United States to secure a better paying \njob and obtain health care insurance. It was in December 2007 that he began his \ncurrent job with an annual starting salary of $58,200. Upon their return to the United \nStates, Applicant and his wife rented a small house for $625 per month and began \naddressing their indebtedness. Tr. 83. 101, AE GG.  \n \nSummarized, Applicant\u2019s medical issues include his being diagnosed with \ndiverticulosis in December 2006, his being diagnosed with colitis in August 2008, his \nbeing diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma (kidney cancer) and prostate cancer in \nSeptember 2008. He had an operation for kidney cancer in October 2008, and an \noperation for prostate cancer in January 2009. Each of these operations resulted in \nrecovery periods approximating six weeks and a 70% salary reduction while he was \nnot working. Also, during these operations, Applicant incurred additional costs \nassociated with travel to a non-local medical treatment facility and uncovered medical \nexpenses. Tr. 86-91. Applicant\u2019s current annual salary is $68,000. Tr. 101, AE GG, AE \nII. \n \nApplicant has made payment arrangements, settled, paid off, or initiated a \ngood-faith dispute with all debts identified in SOR. He took the initiative to resolve his \ndebts well before his SOR was issued and retained an attorney well before his SOR \nwas issued to dispute two debts. Applicant\u2019s current monthly budget reflects a net \nmonthly remainder of $1,542 after his bills are paid. AE II. Applicant testified that he is \nable to live within his means and remain current on his debts. Tr. 83. \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \n \nApplicant submitted at least ten favorable character reference letters from a \ncross section of individuals to include his spouse, co-workers, supervisors, and a \nchildhood friend. The collective sense of these letters describes Applicant in a most \nfavorable way. In particular, adjectives such as \u201cdependable,\u201d \u201ctrustworthy,\u201d \u201chonest,\u201d \n\u201cloyal,\u201d and \u201cprofessional\u201d are repeated throughout these letters. His immediate \nsupervisor described the importance of Applicant\u2019s work in support of national \ndefense. All references fully support Applicant in retaining his security clearance. AE \nG, AE H, AE I, AE K, AE N, AE EE, AE GG, AE HH. \n \nApplicant also submitted a recent employee evaluation covering the period July \n2007 to June 2008, which reflected above average performance. AE O. He also \nsuccessfully completed an Army Basic Instructor Course (102 hours) in May 2009, \nand was awarded a Certificate of Training. AE P. His contribution to the current war \neffort is documented in an article from a major U.S. newspaper published in October \n2008. AE Q. Applicant comes from a family with a long lineage of service to the \nnational defense, which is documented beginning in World War I to the present. AE R, \nAE S, AE Y, AE Z, AE AA. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In \naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are \nuseful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two financial considerations disqualifying conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, his answers \nto DOHA interrogatories, his SOR response, and his statement at his hearing. The \ngovernment established through Applicant\u2019s admissions and evidence presented, the \ndisqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).  \n \n  \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) through \n20(e) are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant\u2019s evidence indicates his financial situation was fairly stable until he \nbegan teaching English at a Mexican university at a reduced salary without health \ncare insurance. When he and his wife incurred significant uncovered medical bills and \nassociated travel costs, they were unable to remain current on their previous \nobligations. Applicant returned to the United States to secure a better paying job with \nbenefits, but unfortunately, by then, his personal finances had gone into a tailspin.  \n \nSince Applicant began his new job, his financial situation has substantially \nimproved. Even before receiving his SOR in June 2009, Applicant took this process \nquite seriously and took reasonable steps to correct his financial situation. He has \nsettled and/or paid all debts alleged except for debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d. and 1.f. \nFor those debts, he has retained the services of an attorney to ascertain who the \ncreditors are, and challenge or settle as necessary. He is current on his payments for \nthose debts, for which he has set up a payment plans. His monthly budget reflects a \nnet remainder of $1,542 after his bills are paid. What is different now as opposed to \nbefore is he has the means, tools and resolve to achieve financial stability. \n \n Considering the record evidence as a whole,1 I am able to give Applicant  full \ncredit under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) through 20(e). The evidence supports the notion that \nApplicant\u2019s finances were under control until he accepted a teaching job at a Mexican \nuniversity at a substantially reduced salary. When he and his wife had medical \nproblems while in Mexico, they found themselves, on their reduced salary, absorbing \nthe costs of treatment and travel to the United States. This situation no longer exists \nnow that Applicant has returned to the United States and secured a better paying job \nwith benefits. \n \nThe attorney retained by Applicant to investigate and resolve the two debts \ndiscussed, supra, also referred him to a credit counseling service. Applicant has \nbenefited from this service and has regained control of his finances. As noted supra, \nApplicant has paid one debt, consolidated three debts, settled one debt for a lesser \namount, and has hired an attorney to resolve two debts. Applicant provided \ndocumentation substantiating the foregoing. In short, Applicant has turned his financial \nsituation around. He has established a viable budget, which shows a net remainder \nafter he has paid his bills, and is able to save money. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n1 See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 \nat 4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for AG \u00b6 20(a), all debts are \nconsidered as a whole. \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                                          \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \nThe comments in the Financial Considerations Analysis section of this decision \nare incorporated in the Whole Person Concept. Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties have \nspanned a number of years. His inability to maintain a state of financial responsibility \nplaced his security clearance at risk and required further review.   \n \nOn the other hand, Applicant has successfully maintained a security clearance \nfor 12 years without incident. His character references provide compelling evidence \nthat Applicant is a loyal and trustworthy U.S. citizen. Applicant\u2019s family lineage is one \nof long-standing military or government service. Applicant\u2019s supervisors have made \nthe case that he has made and continues to make a contribution to the defense \nindustry and war on terrorism. \n \nApplicant receives substantial credit for his service as a defense contractor and \nfor his recent efforts to recover from his financial difficulties. His work for a defense \ncontractor is excellent, and aside from the SOR allegations, no other disciplinary or \nsecurity-related problems surfaced. His record of good employment weighs in his \nfavor. There is a definite dichotomy between how Applicant handled his financial \naffairs and his work-related performance. I am convinced that he is loyal to his family, \nhis company, and his country.   \n \nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. Applicant met his ultimate \nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this \nconclusion, the whole person concept was given due consideration and that analysis \ndoes support a favorable decision. \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d2 \nand supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \n \n2 See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).  \n\n \n9 \n \n \nhas mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nhe is eligible for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. \u2013 1.g.:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nROBERT J. TUIDER \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Stevens, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se  \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nHENRY, Mary E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I grant Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.\nApplicant signed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) version of a security clearance application (SF-86) on May 1, 2006. The Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) on November 20, 2009, detailing security concerns under Guideline J, Criminal\nConduct, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct, that provided the basis for its preliminary\ndecision to deny him a security clearance. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nAdjudicative Guidelines For Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(AG) implemented on September 1, 2006. \n \nMarch 18, 2011\n\nW hen SOR allegations are controverted, the government bears the burden of producing evidence\n1\nsufficient to prove controverted allegations. Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cThat burden has two components. First,\nthe government must establish by substantial evidence that the facts and events alleged in the SOR\nindeed took place. Second, the government must establish a nexus between the existence of the\nestablished facts and events and a legitimate security concern.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 07-18525 at 4 (App.\nBd. Feb. 18, 2009), (concurring and dissenting, in part) (citations omitted). The guidelines presume a\nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an\napplicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 08-06605 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 4, 2010); ISCR Case No.\n08-07290 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2009).\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 5, 2009. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on December 10, 2009, and requested a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. DOHA received the request on December 23, 2009, and\nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on October 14, 2010. DOHA assigned\nthe case to another administrative judge on October 19, 2010. Due to Applicant\u2019s\noverseas assignment, I received the case assignment on November 3, 2010. DOHA\nissued a notice of hearing on November 12, 2010, and I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on December 17, 2010. The Government offered eight exhibits (GE) 1\nthrough 8, which were received and admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant\ntestified, and submitted four exhibits (AE) A through D, which were received and\nadmitted into evidence without objection. The record closed on December 17, 2010.\nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 29, 2010.\nProcedural Ruling\nApplicant agreed to the hearing date about one month before the hearing and\nreceived the written hearing notice on December 5, 2010, less than 15 days before the\nhearing. (Tr. 8.) I advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to receive\nthe notice 15 days before the hearing. Applicant agreed to proceed with his hearing.\n(Id.) \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\nthrough 1.f of the SOR, concerning criminal conduct. His admissions are incorporated\nherein as findings of fact. He denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b of the\nSOR, concerning personal conduct.  After a complete and thorough review of the\n1\nevidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact.  \nApplicant, who is 34 years old, works as a team leader in cellar communications\nfor a Department of Defense contractor. He began his position in October 2003 and\nworks overseas. Since his arrival at his job, he has demonstrated \u201cincredible initiative\nand a strong dedication\u201d to his work. As a result of his hard work, his employer\npromoted him, and he now works as a shift supervisor.

His professional conduct has never been called into question. They consider\nhim well-qualified to hold a clearance.2\nBecause of his father\u2019s military career, Applicant moved many times in childhood.\nHe graduated from high school in 1994. He enlisted in the United States Army in\nSeptember 1995 and received an honorable discharge in September 1999. During his\nfirst his year of college, a cellular phone company offered him employment, which he\naccepted. From 2000 until October 2003, he worked at various communications\ncompanies. He is single and the father of a five-year-old son.3\nWhile serving in the Army, Applicant received a non-judicial punishment (NJP) in\n1996 for disobeying an order. After failing a physical training test, one supervising\nsergeant told him that he could not play on a local basketball team. Another supervisor\nordered him to play on the team, so he did. He accepted the NJP. His punishment was\none week of extra duty.  \n4\nIn March 2000, while driving with two college friends, the police stopped\nApplicant for failure to yield at a right of way yield sign. During the stop, the police officer\nalleged that he smelled marijuana and directed Applicant and his friends to exit the car.\nThe police officer searched all three men on the side of the road and found no weapons\nor contraband. The police officer called for drug sniffing dogs, who also found no drugs\nin the car. The police officer searched the car and found a leafy green substance inside\nthe remains of a cigar in an ashtray in the car. He also found three other cigars in the\ncar. The police charged all three with possession of marijuana, less than 2 ounces, a\nClass B misdemeanor. The police laboratory tested the leafy green substances and\ndetermined that it was not marijuana. Upon the recommendation of the prosecutor, the\ncourt dismissed the charges against Applicant on July 11, 2000.5\nIn November 2001, Applicant drove a company van from the job site. Four co-\nworkers rode with him as he drove along a highway, drinking beer. He drank enough\nbeer to become intoxicated. The police stopped him for speeding. He admitted to the\npolice he had been drinking. The police conducted a field sobriety test and a\nbreathalyzer test. As a result, the police arrested and charged him with driving under the\ninfluence (DUI), speeding, open container, reckless driving, disorderly conduct, leaving\nthe scene of an accident with property damage, and seatbelt violation. Applicant did not\nreceive a notice advising him of a court date and did not appear for his first court date.\nThe court issued a failure to appear warrant, which resulted in his arrest on the warrant\nin 2002. He pled guilty to DUI, and the court dismissed the other charges. The court\nfined him $1,500, placed him on probation, suspended his driver\u2019s license for six\n\nGE 2; GE 4.\n6\nGE 2; Tr. 39-40.\n7\nGE 5; Tr. 36-37.\n8\nNeither party explained the meaning of dead docket. \n9\n4\nmonths, and required him to attend a weekend alcohol education and awareness class.\nHe eventually paid the fines, and he completed his probation.6\nIn May 2002, the police stopped Applicant and charged him with driving on a\nsuspended license and failure to yield right of way following his involvement in a car\naccident. He pled nolo contendre to failure to yield right of way and does not remember\nhow he pled to driving on a suspended license. The court fined him $500 and placed\nhim on probation for 12 months. He paid his fine over time and completed his probation.\nAt some later point in time, a failure to appear warrant was issued on this matter, but the\ncase was fully resolved in June 2003.7\nIn August 2003, Applicant rode with a friend for a haircut at the neighborhood\nbarber shop. On the way, his friend decided to stop to buy a personal bag of heroin.\nThey stopped in a bad section of town. His friend exited the car, and he remained in the\ncar. A police officer from the city drug task force appeared from a place of hiding and\ntold him to get out of the car. The police found a bag of heroin left on the floor of the car\nby his friend and unknown to Applicant. The police charged Applicant with possession of\nheroin. In the rearview mirror of the car, Applicant observed his friend run away when\nthe friend saw the police with Applicant. The police report contains a different version of\nthe events surrounding the arrest, which Applicant strongly disputes. The police report\nindicated that the police officer approached in a marked cruiser and observed Applicant\nopen a suspected bag of heroin. When the police officer got within 10 feet of Applicant,\nApplicant dropped a small straw on the ground and placed a small bag of heroin in his\npants pocket. At a pretrial hearing the following day, Applicant told his story to the court,\nexplaining that the car and heroin were not his. He denied that he was a drug user and\nagreed to an immediate urinalysis drug test. The court directed that Applicant attend\none session of a prevention awareness program, which he did. On September 25, 2003,\nthe court placed Applicant\u2019s case on the dead docket after receiving a favorable pretrial\nreport.8\nApplicant\u2019s version of the events surrounding his arrest in August 2003 differs\nfrom the police report. At his hearing the day after his arrest, Applicant willingly agreed\nto an immediate drug test. The court sentenced him to one preventive awareness class\nand then placed his case on the dead docket.  Given the actions of the trial court, I\n9\nassign greater weight to Applicant\u2019s credible testimony about the totality of the\nproceedings and arrest in August 2003.\nIn September 2003, the police arrested and charged him with possession of\nmarijuana, less than two ounces. The court set a hearing date for October 21, 2003.\nApplicant did not appear at the hearing because he had accepted his current job and\n\nGE 2; GE 6.\n10\nTr. 30, 34.\n11\nThe instruction directed an Applicant to report information regardless of whether the record in your case\n12\nhas been \u201csealed\u201d or otherwise stricken from the record, except for certain convictions under the Federal\nControlled Substances Act. GE 1.\n5\nmoved overseas. Since he did not appear for his hearing, the court issued a failure to\nappear warrant. Applicant acknowledged that he did not quickly resolve this matter. He\nhired an attorney in 2008 to represent him. The court dismissed the case on December\n16, 2008, as there was insufficient evidence.10\nSince his arrest in September 2003, Applicant has not been involved in any\nmatters which could lead to his arrest. He no longer associates with these friends and\nhas not associated with them since September 2003. Applicant describes the period of\n2001 through September 2003 as his \u201cgray cloud period\u201d. He knows his behavior was\ninappropriate and his associates suspect. During this time, he did not consider that\nassociating with individuals who used drugs a problem for him because he did not use\ndrugs. He now realizes that he is judged by the friends he keeps and that friends who\nuse drugs are not friends he should have.11\nWhen he completed his SF-86 (e-QIP) on May 1, 2006, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d\nto the following question:\nSection 23: Police Record12\n(c) Are there currently any charges pending against you for any criminal offense?\nApplicant did not list his drug arrest in August 2003. He, however, answered \u201cyes\u201d to\nquestion (d) under Section 23 and listed his DUI arrest. In response to questions from\nthe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator about his failure to provide this\ninformation, Applicant told the investigator that he did not list the August 2003 arrest\nbecause the case had been dismissed. He declined to discuss the September 2003\narrest with the OPM investigator as the case was still active. \nAt the hearing, Applicant denied intentionally falsifying his answers to these\nquestions. He explained that he sought guidance from his security officer about\ncompleting the SF-86 (e-QIP). He was told to fill out the application to the best of his\nknowledge and not lie. He was advised that if he left anything out, he should not worry\nas he could provide the information in his interview. He understood that the clearance\nprocess involved two parts: the \u201cpaperwork\u201d and the interview. He believed the two\nparts worked together, meaning that if he left information off in the paperwork, he could\nexplain the information in the interview. He acknowledged that he may have\nmisunderstood this information. \nIn answering the questions, Applicant only listed his DUI conviction, not the\ndismissed arrest. He thought he only needed to list his conviction. He did not seek\n\nGE 1; GE 2; Tr. 31-35, 44-47.\n13\n6\nspecific guidance on how to answer these questions. Applicant was open and candid at\nthe hearing.13\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\n\n7\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 31 describes the disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns.\nI have considered all the conditions, and especially the following:\n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;\n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted;\nBetween March 2000 and September 2003, the police arrested Applicant for\ndrugs on three occasions, once for a DUI, and once for driving on a suspended license.\nHe received a NJP in 1996 for disobeying an order. The Government has established its\ncase under the above disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I have\nconsidered all the mitigating conditions, and especially the following:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those\npressures are no longer present in the person's life;\n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement.\nIn 2000, the prosecutor dismissed the marijuana charges against Applicant after\nthe laboratory tests failed to show that the police had found marijuana in his car. Based\non the prosecutor\u2019s decision and the test results, Applicant did not commit the offense\n\n8\nfor which he was charged in 2000. Applicant has mitigated the Government\u2019s security\nconcerns expressed in SOR \u00b6 1.c under AG \u00b6 32(c).\nApplicant was arrested once for DUI, nearly ten years ago. His drug arrests in\n2003 occurred more than seven years ago. The NJP occurred 14 years ago and the\nremaining arrest occurred almost nine years ago. Applicant accepted a job overseas,\nwhere he has worked for more than seven years. He has not been involved in any\ncriminal activity for over seven years. Given the long length of time since his arrests, his\nchange of friends, his demonstrated maturation, and his employer\u2019s favorable\nrecommendations, AG \u00b6 32(a) applies, as his past conduct does not reflect on his\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Since he has not been involved\nin criminal activity for more than seven years, he has recognized that his conduct was\ninappropriate, he has new friends, and he has performed exceptionally well at his job,\nhe has successfully rehabilitated himself. AG \u00b6 32(d) applies.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security\nclearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct,\nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such\nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's\npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another\ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is\nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a\nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence\nservice or other group;\nFor AG \u00b6 16(a) to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission, concealment or falsification of\nrelevant facts on his e-QIP must be deliberate. The Government established that\nApplicant omitted a material fact from his SF-86 when he answered \u201cno\u201d to Question\n23a, about current pending criminal charges against him. This information is material to\n\n9\nthe evaluation of Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness to hold a security clearance and to his\nhonesty. In his response, he denies, however, that he had an intent to hide this\ninformation from the Government. When a falsification allegation is controverted, the\nGovernment has the burden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does\nnot establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred.\nSee ISCR Case No. 07\u201300196 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009); ISCR Case No. 09-07551\n(App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2011) In evaluating whether the Government has presented\nsubstantial evidence regarding the deliberate nature of a false statement or an\nomission, the Judge must examine the statement or omission in light of the record as a\nwhole. Id. In making this determination, the administrative judge must determine\nwhether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s intent or\nstate of mind at the time the omission occurred.\nThe relevant issue for determination is Applicant\u2019s state of mind when he\ncompleted his SF-86 (e-QIP). He knew not to lie as his facility security officer (FSO)\nspecifically told him not to lie. He also understood that if he left any information out of\nhis paperwork, he could provide it to the OPM investigator. Applicant was fully aware of\nhis past arrests when he completed his SF-86 (e-QIP). He listed his DUI arrest, as he\nhad been convicted of this charge by the court. He did not list his August 2003 and\nSeptember 2003 arrests because he had not been convicted. Despite the instruction in\nthe SF-86 (e-QIP) to list all arrests, he thought that he needed only to list his conviction.\nApplicant clearly did not read the instructions carefully and received some poor\nguidance from his facility security officer. Applicant\u2019s carelessness and inattentiveness\nto the instructions for answering the questions regarding his past criminal conduct does\nnot make his decision to answer \u201cno\u201d to Question 23d or his failure to list his August\n2003 arrest an intentional falsity. The Government has not established a prima facie\ncase under Guideline E, which is found in favor of Applicant.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. The decision to grant or\n\n10\ndeny a security clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both\nfavorable and unfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the\nevidence of record, not a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is\nestablished and then whether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility\nfor a security clearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct,\nbut on a reasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a\nnexus exists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nIn reaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I also\nconsidered Applicant\u2019s highly credible testimony and demeanor. Ten years ago, while in\nhis early twenties, Applicant began associating with individuals of questionable\ncharacter. As a result of these associations, the police arrested Applicant on drug\ncharges twice in 2003 and once in 2000. His own conduct lead to his arrest for DUI in\n2001. After accepting an overseas job, in 2003, Applicant moved many miles from his\nthese friends. Over the last seven years, Applicant has thought about his conduct and\nassociations in his \u201cgray cloud period\u201d and realized that society forms a view of an\nindividual based on their associations. He understands that even though he did not use\ndrugs, he would be perceived as drug user if he associated with drug users. He decided\nto change his associations and did. He does not intend to use drugs in the future or\nassociate with individuals who use drugs. He is highly respected at work and supports\nhis son. Since his last arrest in 2003, he has significantly changed his thinking and his\nbehavior. He is a responsible individual with good judgment.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his past criminal\nconduct and his personal conduct under Guidelines J and E.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\n\n11\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline C (Foreign Preference) on March 24,\n2009. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nDecember 4, 2009\n\nW hen  SOR allegations are controverted, the government bears the burden of producing evidence sufficient\n1\nto prove controverted allegations. Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cThat burden has two components. First, the\ngovernment must establish by substantial evidence that the facts and events alleged in the SOR indeed took\nplace. Second, the government must establish a nexus between the existence of the established facts and\nevents and a legitimate security concern.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 07-18525 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2009),\n(concurring and dissenting, in part) (citations omitted).\n  \n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 4, 2009. He answered the\nSOR in writing on May 7, 2009, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge.\nDOHA received the request on May 9, 2009. Department Counsel was prepared to\nproceed on July 30, 2009, and I received the case assignment on August 5, 2009.\nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on August 10, 2009, and I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on September 30, 2009. The government offered three exhibits (GE) 1\nthrough 3, which were received and admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant\nand two witnesses testified on his behalf. He submitted four exhibits (AE) A through D,\nwhich were received and admitted into evidence without objection. I held the record\nopen until October 7, 2009, for Applicant to submit additional matters. He submitted five\nexhibits, AE E through AE I, without objection. The record closed on October 7, 2009.\nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on October 8, 2009.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nNotice\nAt the hearing, Applicant\u2019s counsel could not state definitively when he or\nApplicant received the hearing notice. (Tr. 9.) If the notice was received in less than 15\ndays before the hearing, Applicant\u2019s counsel affirmatively waived his right to 15 days\nnotice. (Tr. 9.) \nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to the Arab Republic of Egypt (Egypt). (Tr. 15) The request and\nthe attached documents were not admitted into evidence, but the documents were\nincluded in the record as Hearing Exhibits I to VI. The facts administratively noticed are\nset out in the Findings of Fact below. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a,\n1.b, and 2.a through 2.d of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the factual allegation\nin \u00b6 1.c of the SOR.  He also provided additional information to support his request for\n1\neligibility for a security clearance.  \nApplicant, who is 52 years old, works as an Information Technology instructor for\na Department of State contractor. He began working for his current employer two years\nago.

He has held a security clearance since 2000 or 2001. He\nhas not violated security procedures for handling classified information since being\ngranted a security clearance. He attends security training courses twice a year and has\nreceived several awards from his employers.2\nApplicant was born in Cairo, Egypt. He graduated from high school and college in\nEgypt, receiving a bachelor\u2019s degree in agriculture. He emigrated from Egypt to the\nUnited States in 1983 seeking a better life and better opportunities. Applicant became a\nnaturalized U.S. citizen in March 1991. After becoming a U.S. citizen, Applicant\nobtained a U.S. passport. He also retained his Egyptian citizenship and passport. Since\n1991, he has periodically renewed his Egyptian passport.3\nApplicant met his wife in the United States They married in 1991 and have a\ndaughter, who is 13 years old. His wife, who was born in Switzerland, moved to the\nUnited States at age three and is a naturalized U.S. citizen. His daughter is a U.S.\ncitizen by birth.4\nSince arriving in the United States, Applicant returned to school for additional\neducation. He completed certain prerequisite courses for graduate school at a\ncommunity college, from which he received an associate of arts degree. He completed\na masters degree in information technology at a U.S. university. He has also received\nmany certifications related to information technology and his training skills.5\nApplicant\u2019s 78-year-old mother lives in a rural village north of Cairo, Egypt. His\nelderly mother is infirm. She suffers from multiple ailments, including diabetes, high\nblood pressure, kidney problems, and some problems related to Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nBecause she cannot walk and requires full-time care, a maid lives with his mother.\nApplicant purchased the small house in which his mother lives seven or eight years ago\nfor $70,000. He sold this property in February 2009. He transferred all proceeds from\nthe sale of the house to his U.S. accounts. His mother continues to live in the house and\nnow pays rent to the new owners. Once he sold the house, he relinquished all control\nover this property. He provides $300 a month in support to his mother, as does one of\nhis sisters. He will not receive any inheritance from his mother upon her death. At one\ntime, he asked his mother about moving to live with him in the United States. She\ndeclined because she did not want to leave her homeland, because her care is much\nless costly in Egypt, and because she has what she needs to live.6\n\nGE 3; AE D; Tr. 67-72.\n7\nTr. 48-50, 82.\n8\nId. at 50-52, 82.\n9\nId. at 52-54, 82.\n10\nId. at 82-86, 89.\n11\n  \n4\nFrom 1991 until 2006, Applicant traveled to Egypt once a year to visit his mother.\nNo one required him to make these trips; rather, he wanted to make the trips to visit his\nmother. In 2006, the Department of State opened a training center in Cairo, Egypt. His\nemployer selected Applicant to conduct its training sessions. His job requires him to\ntravel three times a year to Cairo, Egypt. Arrangements for his business trips are made\nby the Department of State, and he complies with their trip arrangements. When he is in\nCairo on business, he visits his mother. He advises the U.S. embassy security office\nwhen he leaves to visit his mother. His mother knows that he \u201cteaches computers.\u201d She\ndoes not know he holds a security clearance or any other information about his job. His\nmother does not know anything about computers.7\nApplicant\u2019s oldest sister is 63 years old. She is a citizen and resident of Egypt.\nShe is married. Her husband is a retired insurance company officer and she is a\nhousewife. Applicant talks with her by telephone two or three times a year, and he may\nvisit with her when he visits his mother in Egypt. She has never visited him in the United\nStates, and is not involved in politics.8\nApplicant\u2019s middle sister is 54 years old, and a citizen and resident of Egypt. She\nworks as a principal at a public high school. Her husband teaches fine arts and creates\nsculptures at a public university. Their four children are medical doctors in Egypt. He\nbelieves all four children are professors of medicine at universities. If she is available,\nhe will visit with her when he visits his mother. This family is not involved in politics, and\nnone of the members have visited him in the United States.   \n9\nHis youngest sister is 45 years old. She lives in northern Egypt and is a\nhousewife. Her husband works as a manager for a private construction company. Her\nthree children are still in school. If she can come when he is visiting his mother, he will\nvisit with her. She is not involved in politics, and has not visited him in the United\nStates.10\nApplicant maintains contact with a childhood friend in Egypt. His friend works as\nthe general manger for sales and marketing for a U.S. company in Egypt. His friend\ndoes not work for the Egyptian Army or government. His friend\u2019s wife is a housewife. He\ntalks with his friend about five times a year. As with his family, his friend knows that\nApplicant \u201cteaches computers\u201d, but does not know any more about Applicant\u2019s work. His\nfriend does not seek information about Applicant\u2019s job. He sees his friend once a year,\nand does not provide any financial support to his friend.     \n11\n\nAE C; Tr. 60-63, 66-67.\n12\nTr. 17-26, 28-35.\n13\nAE A.\n14\n  \n5\nWhen he traveled to Egypt, Applicant traveled on his U.S. passport as a U.S.\ncitizen. He maintained his Egyptian passport to ease his entry into Egypt, once he\narrived. He used his Egyptian passport in lieu of a visa, which is required for entry into\nEgypt. When he learned that his passport presented a problem, he contacted the\nEgyptian embassy in the United States. He filed the necessary papers to formally\nrevoke his Egyptian citizenship, and returned his Egyptian passport and Egyptian I.D.\n(Identification card) While he has not received a formal letter accepting his citizenship\nrenunciation, he considers his Egyptian citizenship revoked.12\nTwo co-workers testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. They know him through work and\nsocially. Both describe him as very professional. Applicant has an excellent reputation\nas a teacher and employee. He is reliable and dependable. He follows the office rules\nand has never tried to access company proprietary or confidential information. He has a\nsecret clearance and has complied with the rules for holding a security clearance.\nNeither believes he would favor Egypt over the United States.13\nApplicant\u2019s second-level supervisor, a foreign service employee with the\nDepartment of State, wrote a letter of recommendation. He described Applicant as\nextremely reliable, dependable, honest, and trustworthy. He has traveled with Applicant\non overseas jobs, and has no reservations about Applicant holding a security clearance.\nHe knew Applicant had an Egyptian passport and family in Egypt. Based on his\nconversations and contacts with Applicant, he opined that Applicant is very loyal to the\nUnited States and its government, and that Applicant does not have a preference for\nanother country. Rather, Applicant has a deep abiding affection for the United States,\nand is committed to this country.  \n14\nI take administrative notice of the following facts. Egypt has extensive strategic,\neconomic, and military ties to the United States. Egypt has been a unified state for more\nthan 5,000 years. Egypt is a stable, constitutional country with a strong executive branch\nof government and popularly elected People\u2019s Assembly. The dominant political party is\nthe National Democratic Party. Egypt is a strong military and strategic partner of the\nUnited States. The United States provides significant military aide to Egypt to help\nmodernize Egypt\u2019s military. There is no indication Egypt seeks U.S. military information\nor classified information. Egypt and the United States are strong friends based on a\nshared and mutual interest in peace and stability in the Middle East. Egypt played a key\nrole in the 1990-1991 Gulf crisis. It maintains a strong dialogue and shares information\non a broad range of counterterrorism and law enforcement issues with the United States.\nRecently, Egypt tightened its terrorist finance regulations and revised its anti-laundering\nlegislation to make terrorism financing a punishable crime.\n\nHearing Exhibits I to VI.\n15\n  \n6\nTerrorist attacks have occurred in certain tourist areas of Egypt. Al-Jihad is an\nEgyptian Islamic extremist group identified in Egypt. The majority of its members,\nhowever, reside outside Egypt. In the area of human rights, Egypt\u2019s record is poor. Egypt\ndoes not have a record of government political killings, but some killings result from\npolice brutality. Freedom of expression and freedom of the press is more limited than in\nthe United States. The Egyptian government is more restrictive with organizations raising\nhuman rights issues. Citizens generally enjoy relative freedom from government\ninterference.15\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An applicant\nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\n\n  \n7\nan applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nUnder AG \u00b6 9 the security concern involving foreign preference arises, \u201c[W]hen an\nindividual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the\nUnited States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions\nthat are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 10, a security concern could be raised under the following\ndisqualifying conditions:\n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family\nmember.  This includes but is not limited to:\n(1) possession of a current foreign passport.\nAfter he became a U.S. citizen in 1991, Applicant retained his Egyptian passport\nand maintained dual citizenship with Egypt. Over the next 17 years, he periodically\nrenewed his Egyptian passport. He used his Egyptian passport in lieu of the visa\nrequired for entry into Egypt by foreign visitors. The government has established its\nprima facie case under Guideline C. \nUnder AG \u00b6 11, Applicant could mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns\nthrough one of the following ways:\n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship; and\n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security\nauthority, or otherwise invalidated.\nWhen he learned that his Egyptian passport impacted his ability to retain his\nsecurity clearance, Applicant contacted the Egyptian Embassy in the United States. He\nobtained, then completed the necessary paperwork to renounce his Egyptian citizenship.\nHe submitted this paperwork and his Egyptian passport to the Embassy in June 2009.\nAlthough he has not received a letter indicating that his renunciation has been\nacknowledged by the Egyptian government, he considers his Egyptian citizenship\n\n  \n8\nrenounced. Since he no longer has his Egyptian passport, he must now, as a foreign\nvisitor, obtain a visa to enter Egypt. Applicant has mitigated the government\u2019s security\nconcerns under Guideline C. \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in\nAG & 6:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism. \nUnder the potential disqualifying conditions described in AG \u00b6 7, the following\nconditions could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case:\n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign\ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and\n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to\nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual's desire to\nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information.\nApplicant has a daughter who is a U.S. citizen by birth. His wife is a resident and\nnaturalized U.S. citizen, who was raised in the United States. Thus, no security concern\nis raised by these family members. Applicant\u2019s mother and three sisters are citizens and\nresidents of Egypt. Applicant maintains a normal, familial relationship with his mother\nand a more limited familial relationship with his sisters. He talks with his mother by\ntelephone regularly and his sisters occasionally. After becoming a U.S. citizen, he visited\nhis mother regularly. Sometimes he saw all his sisters during his visits, but not always. \nHis work assignment changed in 2006. After the Department of State opened a\ntraining center in Cairo, Egypt, his company selected him to conduct training programs at\nthis site. He travels three times a year to Cairo, Egypt, on business. While in Cairo,\nEgypt, his visits his ailing and elderly mother. He complies with all requirements of the\nU.S. government when he enters Egypt, and when he leaves Cairo to visit his mother.\nAgain, he may or may not see one or all his sisters during these visits because of their\n\nUnder the old adjudicative guidelines, a disqualifying condition based on foreign family members could not\n16\nbe mitigated unless an applicant could establish that the family members were not in a position to be exploited.\nThe Appeal Board consistently applied this mitigating condition narrowly, holding that its underlying premise\nwas that an applicant should not be placed in a position where he is forced to make a choice between the\ninterest of the family member and the interest of the United States. (See ISCR Case No. 03-17620, (App. Bd,\nApr. 17, 2006); ISCR Case No. 03-24933, (App. Bd. Jul. 28, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-02382, (App. Bd. Feb.\n15, 2005); and ISCR Case No. 03-15205, (App. Bd. Jan. 21. 2005)). Thus, an administrative judge was not\npermitted to apply a balancing test to assess the extent of the security risk.\n  \n9\nschedules. He does provide financial support to his mother each month and purchased\na home for her seven or eight years ago. Applicant remains close friends with a\nchildhood friend. They talk with each other about five times a year. Applicant\noccasionally visits with his friend when he is in Egypt. His family relationships and one\nfriendship are not per se a reason to deny Applicant a security clearance, but his\ncontacts with family members and his close friend must be considered in deciding\nwhether to grant Applicant a clearance. The government must establish that these family\nrelationships and friendship create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion or would create a potential conflict of interest\nbetween his obligations to protect sensitive information and his desire to help his family\nmembers and friend.  \nIn determining if a heightened risk exists, I must look at Applicant\u2019s relationship\nand contacts with family members and his longtime friend as well as the activities of the\ngovernment of Egypt and terrorist organizations within this country. See ISCR Case No.\n07-05809 (App. Bd. May 27, 2008). The risk that an applicant could be targeted for\nmanipulation or induced into compromising classified information is real, not theoretical.\nApplicant\u2019s relationship and contacts with his mother, sisters, and friend in Egypt raises a\nheightened risk of security concerns because of the possible activities of terrorist\norganizations in Egypt. The information of record fails to show that the Egyptian\ngovernment engages in espionage activities in the United States or that it targets U.S.\ncitizens in the United States or Egypt by exploiting, manipulating, pressuring, or coercing\nthem to obtain protected information. \nUnder the new guidelines, potentially conflicting loyalties may be weighed to\ndetermine if an applicant can be expected to resolve any conflict in favor of U.S.\ninterests.  In determining if Applicant\u2019s contacts in Egypt cause security concerns, I\n16\nconsidered that Egypt and the United States have a close relationship and that Egypt is\ncooperating with the United States in the fight against terrorism, including taking action\nagainst financiers of terror in its country. There is no evidence that the Egyptian\ngovernment targets U.S. citizens for protected information. Human rights issues in Egypt\ncontinue to be a concern. The terrorist organizations, not the Egyptian government, may\ntarget U.S. citizens in Egypt. While none of these considerations by themselves dispose\nof the issue, they are all factors to be considered in determining Applicant\u2019s vulnerability\nto pressure or coercion because of his family members and longtime friend in Egypt.\nBecause of the activities of terrorist organizations in Egypt, Applicant\u2019s trips to Egypt and\ncontacts with his family and friend in Egypt raise a concern about heightened under AG\n\u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b).\n\n  \n10\nIn deciding if Applicant has established mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(a), I must\nconsider whether: \nthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in\nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual,\ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.\nand under AG \u00b6 8(b), I must consider whether Applicant has established:\n \nthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is\nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interests.\nApplicant\u2019s normal relationship with his family members and friend is not a basis\nto deny him a security clearance; however, his burden of proof on mitigation requires\nmore than statements about the limited scope of his conversations with his mother, three\nsisters, and friend. See ISCR Case No. 07-02485 (App. Bd. May 9, 2008). Because the\nEgyptian government funds schools, Applicant\u2019s one sister works, at least indirectly, for\nthe Egyptian government. However, his sisters, as well as his mother, have never held a\npolitical position and neither does his friend. Applicant\u2019s family and his friend have not\nbeen targeted by the Egyptian government. His family members and friend have never\nbeen imprisoned nor is there any evidence that his family members in Egypt have\nsuffered any abuses from the Egyptian government. His closest family members, his wife\nand daughter, are residents of the United States. He no longer owns any property in\nEgypt, having sold the house he owned, and keeps no financial assets in Egypt. His\nlongtime friend works for a large U.S. company. Balancing these factors as well as\nEgypt\u2019s cooperation in counterterrorism, and the lack of evidence that the Egyptian\ngovernment targets U.S. citizens for protected information against Egypt\u2019s poor human\nrights record, I find that Applicant would resolve any conflict in favor of U.S. interests.\nLikewise, any threats by terrorist organizations against Applicant\u2019s family and friend in\nEgypt would be resolved in favor of U.S. interests. His loyalties are to the United States,\nnot Egypt. Applicant has mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns as to his family\ncontacts under AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b).\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\n\n  \n11\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or\ndeny a security clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both\nfavorable and unfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the\nevidence of record, not a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is\nestablished and then whether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility\nfor a security clearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct, but\non a reasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a nexus\nexists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nThe evidence in support of granting a security clearance to applicant under the\nwhole person concept is more substantial than the evidence in support of a denial. In\nreaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions\nin light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant spent the first\nhalf of his life in Egypt, where he was born and raised. Since emigrating to the United\nStates more than 25 years ago, he has maintained close contact with his mother, visiting\nher at least once a year. He also maintains regular contact with his sisters and a\nchildhood friend. However, his closest family members are his wife and daughter, who\nare U.S. citizens and residents. His loyalties are to the United States and his family in the\nUnited States. He is trusted by the Department of State to work in Egypt, and he has\nnever done anything to betray this trust.\nHe helps support his mother with a small amount of money each month. This\nmoney does not reflect a preference for Egypt, but rather an effort by Applicant to assure\nthat his mother has money for food and other basic life necessities. Applicant has been\nin the United States for over 25 years, and has developed a life in the United States.\nAlthough he visits his mother regularly, his life, his work, his home, and most important\nfamily members are in the United States. In balancing all these factors and the close\nrelationship between Egypt and the U.S. against possible terrorist actions against his\nfamily members and friend in Egypt, I find that Applicant would act in the best interests of\nthe United States. He readily gave up his Egyptian citizenship and passport when he\nlearned that the possession of both negatively impacted his ability to hold a security\nclearance. This action supports my conclusion that he would put U.S. interests first.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under the guidelines for\nforeign preference and foreign influence.\n\n  \n12\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Goldstein, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nApril 7, 2010\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) dated August 1, 2007.  (Government Exhibit 1.)  On June 5, 2009, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as\namended), and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the\nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative\nJudge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.\n The Applicant responded to the SOR on July 2, 2009, and she requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was originally assigned to\nanother Administrative Judge on August 6, 2009.  The matter was reassigned to the\nundersigned on August 24, 2009.  A notice of hearing was issued on September 11,\n2009, scheduling the hearing for October 6, 2009.  At the hearing the Government\nmoved to amend paragraph 2, allegation (b), to reflect Question 22(b) of the Public\n\n2\nTrust Position Application dated November 14, 2006, rather than Question 20.\nApplicant had no objection.  (Government Exhibit 3 and Tr. p. 31.)  The Government\npresented twelve exhibits, referred to Government Exhibits 1 to 12, which were admitted\nwithout objection.  The Applicant presented seven exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits A through G, which were admitted without objection.  The Applicant also\ntestified on her own behalf.  The record remained open until October 13, 2009, to allow\nthe Applicant the opportunity to submit additional documentation.  The Applicant\nsubmitted eight Post-Hearing Exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits\n1 through 8, which were admitted without objection.  The official transcript (Tr.) was\nreceived on October 13, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nthe testimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 34 years old, and has a high school\ndiploma and one year of college.  She is employed by a defense contractor as an\nAdministrative Assistant and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with\nher employment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because she is financially overextended\nand at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe Applicant admits each of the fourteen delinquent debts set forth in the SOR\nunder this guideline that total approximately $414,413.00.  (See Applicant\u2019s Answer to\nSOR.)  Credit Reports of the Applicant dated August 31, 2001; September 26, 2008;\nApril 29, 2009; July 30, 2009; and September 28, 2009, collectively reflect each of the\ndelinquent debts set forth in the SOR.  (Government Exhibits 5, 6, 7, 8 and 12.)\nApplicant attributes her financial difficulties to a separation from her first husband in\n1998, their divorce in 2004, absorbing all of the debt from the marriage herself, being a\nsingle mother with two children from 1998 to 2004, living on one income, and being\nresponsible for taking care of her mother.  In 2004, she married her current husband\nand there are two children from this marriage.  All of the debt set forth in the SOR,\nexcept the foreclosure and some medical bills, was incurred during and after her first\nmarriage and before she met her current husband.  (Tr. p. 91.)   \nEach of the delinquent debts set forth in the SOR have now been resolved.\nDelinquent debts owed to a creditor in the amount of $191.00; $1,000.00; $87.00;\n\n3\n$1,079.00; $1,697.00; $180.00; and $93.00 have been paid.  (SOR allegations 1(a)\nthrough 1(g).  Applicant testified that these debts were for medical bills incurred by her\nchildren  She states that she had been making payments since 2005, and thought her\nhusband had paid off the debts in full.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits D and E.)  She consolidated\nthe debts and had been making payments of $100.00 each month since July 2009.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G.)  Following the hearing, she borrowed from her retirement\naccount and settled the debts in full for $3,800.00.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit 8.) \nA delinquent debt owed to a creditor in the amount of $57.00 has been paid.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.)  (SOR 1(h).)  A debt owed to a creditor in the amount of $51.00\nfor a bounced check has been paid.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.)  (SOR 1(k).)  \nDebts owed to creditors in the amount of $328,000.00 and $80,640.00 have been\nresolved.  (SOR 1(i) and 1(j).)  Applicant explained that these debts were for the first\nand second loan on her house.  As a result of a bad adjustable loan, Applicant and her\nhusband could no longer afford the payments.  After unsuccessful efforts to refinance\nand/or sell the house, it was ultimately foreclosed upon in July or August 2007 and\nresold.  Applicant was told that she was no longer responsible for the debt and has not\nbeen contacted by the bank.  (Tr. p. 57.)  \nA debt owed to a creditor in the amount of $2,045.00 was settled in full for\n$613.52.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit 7.)  (SOR 1.l).)  A debt owed to a creditor in\nthe amount of $278.00 has been paid.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits 5 and 6).\n(SOR 1(m).)  A debt owed to a creditor in the amount of $1,015.00 was settled in full for\n$457.00.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit 4). (SOR 1(n).)  \nApplicant stated that she has also taken her daughter out of private school, which\nsaves $336.00 monthly.  After paying their monthly expenses, she and her husband\nhave sufficient discretionary money to pay their current debts.      \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he intentionally falsified material\naspects of her personal background during the employment process.\nThe Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP) dated August 1, 2007.  Question 28(a) of the application asked the\nApplicant if in the last seven years she has been over 180 days delinquent on any\ndebts.  The Applicant answered, \u201cNO\u201d.  (Government Exhibits 1 and 2.)  This was a\nfalse answer.  Applicant failed to list any of the debts set forth in the SOR.  The\nApplicant explained that she must have misunderstood the question, and she may have\nrushed through the application.  She also thought many of the debts were paid off and\nolder than seven years.  She was given a month to complete the application.  (Tr. p.\n96.)\n  \n\n4\nThe Applicant also completed a Public Trust Positions Application dated\nNovember 14, 2006, wherein the Applicant was asked if she is now over 180 days\ndelinquent on any loan or financial obligation.  The Applicant answered, \u201cNO\u201d. This was\na false answer.  (Government Exhibit 3.)  The Applicant failed to list any of the debts set\nforth in the SOR.  The Applicant explained that she must have misunderstood the\nquestion.  She states that she had no assistance in filling out the questions, and\nbelieves that she should have asked for help. \nTwo letters of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s current manager, and a co-\nworker, indicate that she is professional, responsible, well organized, accountable, and\ncommitted to her job.  She is considered highly trustworthy.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing\nExhibits 1 and 2.) \n     \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n19(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n20(b) the condition that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstance;\n20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\n\n5\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n16(a)  The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and\nmaterial facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation;\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct;\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary;\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral\nchanges;\ng.  The motivation for the conduct; \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress; and \n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\n6\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicated\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\ninstances of financial irresponsibility and dishonesty which demonstrates poor judgment\nor unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F), and untruthful on her\nQuestionnaire for Investigations Processing (Guideline E).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with her security clearance eligibility.\nWith respect to her finances, most of the Applicant\u2019s delinquent debt was\nincurred as a result of her separation and divorce and the consequences of being a\n\n7\nsingle mother with children.  Since then, she has resolved most, if not all, of her\ndelinquent debt.  Other than her mortgage, she has paid off all of the debts set forth in\nthe SOR.  When she could no longer afford her home, she did everything humanly\npossible to save it from foreclosure.  Despite this, her house was foreclosed upon and\nresold.  She has not received anything from the bank or from the tax authorities, and\nwas told that the matter was resolved.  She currently demonstrates financial\nrehabilitation.  She has presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate a track record of\nfinancial responsibility and has resolved her financial indebtedness.\nThere is sufficient evidence of financial rehabilitation at this time.  Under\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19(a) inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts and 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations\napply.  However, Mitigating Conditions 20(b) the condition that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstance and, 20(d) the individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts also apply.  The\nApplicant has indeed made a good faith effort to repay her overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve her debts.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations).  \nOn the other hand, with respect to Guideline E, the Applicant deliberately\nconcealed material information from the Government on two security clearance\napplications in response to her history of delinquent indebtedness.  She claims that she\nmisunderstood the questions, however, they are not complicated or confusing, nor\nwould a reasonable person under similar circumstance believe so.  She was given a\nmonth to complete the application.  With the particular evidence that I have been\nprovided, there is no reasonable excuse for her failure to answer the questions\ntruthfully. She was obviously trying to conceal her delinquent indebtedness and was not\ncareful or serious when filling out the questionnaire.  Consequently, that attitude reflects\nunreliability.  Thus, the evidence shows that the Applicant cannot be trusted with the\nnational secrets.  Disqualifying Condition 16(a)  the deliberate omission, concealment,\nor falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities applies.  None of the\nmitigating conditions are applicable.  \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole-person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.  \n\n8\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing her request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 2  of the Government's Statement of Reasons.  As\ndiscussed above, Paragraph 1 is found for the Applicant.     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.j.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.k.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.l.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.m.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.n.:\nFor the Applicant.\nParagraph 2: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n   \nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn March 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nto Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline B. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 6, 2009, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on July 15, 2009. DOHA \nissued a Notice of Hearing on July 21, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled on \nAugust 17, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3 and Hearing \n \n1 \n \n \nSeptember 4, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nExhibits (HE) I though IV, requesting I take administrative notice of the latter. Applicant \ndid not object, the exhibits were admitted, and the request for administrative notice was \ngranted. Applicant testified and offered Exhibits (AE) A and B, they were admitted \nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on August 21, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 48 years old. He immigrated to the U.S. from Sri Lanka in 1990 and \nbecame a naturalized citizen in 2006. He earned a bachelors degree in 1993 and later \nearned a masters degree. He has worked for a federal contractor since 2006 and has \nheld a public trust position since 2006.1  \n \n \nApplicant grew up in Sri Lanka and moved to the U.S. to study. He earned an \nassociates degree in Sri Lanka. His mother lives in Sri Lanka and is ailing. He travels \nthere to visit her. Since 2000, he has traveled about six to seven times and stays \nbetween 10 and 20 days per visit, with his mother. He calls her on the telephone about \nonce a month. He provides financial support to his mother. He estimated that in 2008 he \nprovided approximately $3,000 and to date in 2009, approximately $1,000. In past \nyears, he has provided approximately $500 to $1,000 to his mother. His mother is a \nretired school teacher who receives a pension from the government. The health care \nsystem and hospitals are funded by the government and there are also private \nhospitals. The money Applicant sends to his mother is to subsidize her medical care. \nHis mother owns her home. He does not believe he has any inheritance rights, and the \nhome will go to his brother when she dies.2  \n \n \nApplicant married his wife in 1997 in the U.S. She is a medical doctor. She is a \ncitizen of Sri Lanka and was visiting the U.S. when they met. She moved back to Sri \nLanka in February or March of 1998, and gave birth to a daughter in July 1998. His wife \nreturned to the U.S. in 2000 and they lived together until 2003. She then moved back to \nSri Lanka with their daughter and has not returned. His daughter is a citizen and \nresident of Sri Lanka. Applicant provides child support for his daughter. He pays for \nmost of her tuition to attend additional classes outside of school. He estimated he \nprovides approximately $2,000 a year in child support.3  \n \n \nApplicant is estranged from his wife. When he travels to Sri Lanka, he has limited \ncontact with her and then only when he goes to visit his daughter. He visits his daughter \nabout once a year. He may speak on the phone with his wife about his daughter, but \nthis contact is infrequent. He calls his daughter about once a month. He admits he does \n \n1 Tr. 10, 22-24. \n \n2 Tr. 24, 38-39, 46-47, 52-54. \n \n3 Tr. 19-21, 30-40, 43-45. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nnot have a good relationship with his daughter. He does visit with her, at her house, \nwhen he travels to Sri Lanka. He will spend a few hours with his daughter during his \nvisits and the rest of the time with his mother. His daughter does not visit Applicant\u2019s \nmother. His wife has not returned to the U.S since she left in 2003. Applicant anticipated \nthat after his mother dies, he will not go back to Sri Lanka to see his daughter. He \nstated it is up to his wife whether she will permit him to see his daughter or visit him in \nthe U.S. He stated it is difficult for him to see her in Sri Lanka and it is only if his wife \nallows it. He stated he doubted his daughter would come and stay with him.4  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents-in-law live with his wife in Sri Lanka. The only time he sees \nthem is when he visits his daughter annually. His father-in-law is a retired government \nworker. His mother-in-law is a retired nurse who worked for the Sri Lankan hospital \nsystem.5  \n \n \nApplicant is still legally married to his wife. He has not filed for a divorce. In his \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) interview in 2006, he stated that living apart \nhas put a strain on their marriage, but they are not legally separated nor will they \ndivorce. At his hearing, Applicant stated he contacted an attorney in 2003 regarding a \ndivorce. His statements are inconsistent. He has not pursued a divorce because of the \ncost. Applicant\u2019s father was sick in 2005 and died in 2006. In 2007, his mother became \nill. He stated he has been focused on those problems instead.6  \n \n \nApplicant stated he has no relationships in the U.S. His focus is on his job and he \nwants to continue to live in the U.S. He has no options in Sri Lanka and that is the \nreason he plans on remaining in the U.S.7 \n \n \nApplicant has no relatives in the U.S. He owns a house he bought in 2005 for \napproximately $480,000. He does not own any property in Sri Lanka. He has no foreign \ninvestments. He estimated he has approximately $6,000 in savings and $7,000-$8,000 \nin his checking account. He also has approximately $5,000 in a 401k account.8  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother is a citizen and resident of Sri Lanka. He does not always see \nhim when he visits Sri Lanka. His brother works for a private factory. His brother\u2019s wife \nworks for the same factory. Applicant does not speak to his brother. His brother does \nnot participate in the care for their mother. His brother has not discussed moving to the \n \n4 Tr. 41-43, 47-51, 54. \n \n5 Tr. 52. \n \n6 Tr. 30, 65-68. \n \n7 Tr. 67-68. \n \n8 Tr. 26-30, 39. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nU.S. Applicant last saw his brother at his father\u2019s funeral in 2006. No one in Applicant\u2019s \nfamily visits him in the U.S.9 \n \n \nWhen Applicant visits Sri Lanka, he registers his visit and where he is staying \nwith the local police station, as required of all foreign visitors. He advises the police he \nis a U.S. citizen staying with his mother.10   \n \n \nApplicant traveled and visited Sri Lanka in 1993 and then approximately every \nthree years until his parents\u2019 health became an issue. He then increased his visits and \nvisited in 2000, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. He visited both his mother \nand daughter on his last visit in April 2009.11  \n \n \nApplicant provided a letter from a person who worked with him for the past twelve \nmonths. His coworker stated Applicant appears to be an honest person who has no \npersonal or political issues. Applicant also provided a certificate of appreciation from an \nemployer. 12 \n \nSri Lanka13 \n \n \nSri Lanka is a constitutional, multiparty republic. The law requires all foreign \nguests in private households to register in person at the nearest local police station. The \nU.S. State Department warns U.S. citizens of the dangers in travel to Sri Lanka. Despite \nthe government\u2019s announcement that it had achieved victory over an armed insurgent \ngroup, there is still potential for instability, including terrorist attacks. Prior to the victory \nbeing declared in May 2009, the country was embroiled in more than 25 years of civil \nwar and terrorism.  \n \n \nThe U.S. government designated a Sri Lankan group as a foreign terrorist \norganization. The Sri Lankan government and the terrorist organization have engaged \n\u201cin any means necessary\u201d tactics to fight the war, including the government\u2019s use of \nparamilitary organizations that rely on abduction, extrajudicial killings, and other illegal \ntactics to combat the terrorist group.  \n \n \nTravel in certain parts of the country is discouraged due to possible renewed \ninsurgency and uncleared land mines. U.S. Government officials are prohibited from \nnon-official travel to certain parts of the country.  \n \n \n9 Tr. 51-52, 61. \n \n10 Tr. 62-64. \n \n11 Tr. 59-61. \n \n12 Tr. 71-72; AE A and B. \n \n13 HE I-IV. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nThe government\u2019s respect for human rights declined as armed conflict escalated. \nUnlawful use of child-soldiers, politically motivated killings, arbitrary arrests and \ndetentions, and unlawful killings by paramilitary groups and others working with the \nawareness of the government, along with serious human rights abuses, were reported \nduring 2008. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common-sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:  \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them and especially considered the following:  \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information;  \n \n(c) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign operated business, which \ncould subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation.  \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \n\n \n7 \n \n \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. Applicant\u2019s wife, daughter, mother, brother and \nparents-in-law are all citizens and residents of Sri Lanka. He also travels regularly to \nvisit his mother and daughter. His wife is employed at a hospital there and his mother \nand parents-in-law receive pensions through the government. Although he describes his \nrelationship with his wife as estranged, he remains married to her. His relationship with \nhis wife, daughter and mother creates a heightened risk of foreign pressure, or \nattempted exploitation. Applicant\u2019s connection with his wife, daughter and mother also \ncreates a conflict of interest because his continuing relationships are sufficiently close to \nraise a security concern. Therefore, I find disqualifying conditions (a) and (b) apply. It \ndoes not appear Applicant has a financial or business interest in Sri Lanka and \ndisqualifying condition (e) does not apply. It appears Applicant does not maintain \ncontact with his brother. Applicant is not sufficiently close to his parents-in-law to raise a \nsecurity concern. I find no disqualifying conditions apply to his brother or parents-in-law. \nApplicant does not share living quarters with his relatives, so disqualifying condition (c) \ndoes not apply. \n \nI have also analyzed all of the facts and considered all of the mitigating conditions \nfor this security concern under AG \u00b6 8 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization and interests of the U.S.;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests; and  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation.  \n \nApplicant has traveled to Sri Lanka to visit his mother and daughter regularly. He \nprovides financial support to both of them. He remains married to his wife, even though \nthey do not live together. Her parents live with his wife and his daughter. He calls his \ndaughter on the phone. Applicant has not met his burden of establishing that it is \nunlikely he will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of his \nfamily living in Sri Lanka and the interests of the U.S. His contacts with family in Sri \nLanka could potentially force him to choose between the two.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human \nrights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members \nare vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the foreign government, or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the U.S. Sri Lanka requires Applicant \nto register at the local police station and list where he is staying. No evidence was \npresented that Sri Lanka conducts intelligence operations against the U.S. However, \nthere is evidence regarding Sri Lanka\u2019s human rights record and active terrorist groups \noperating in the country. This places the burden of persuasion on Applicant to \ndemonstrate that his contacts in Sri Lanka do not pose a security risk, and he is not in a \nposition to be forced to choose between loyalty to the U.S. and his family members. \nWith its negative human rights record and its government\u2019s willingness to use \nparamilitary forces and \u201cany means necessary\u201d to combat the enemy should the terrorist \nthreat be regenerated and civil war be reignited, it is conceivable that Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers could be vulnerable to coercion. I find mitigating condition (a) does not apply. \n \nApplicant has been a U.S. citizen since 2006. He has no family in the U.S. All of \nhis family tires remain in Sri Lanka. His wife, daughter, and mother are citizens and \nresidents of Sri Lanka. His mother receives a government pension. He visits Sri Lanka \nregularly to visit his daughter and mother. He provides financial support to both of them. \nHe talks on the phone to them. He has some contact with his wife. Considering Sir \nLanka\u2019s human rights record and the potential conflict of interest, I find under the \ncircumstances mitigating condition (b) does not apply.  \n \nSecurity concerns are reduced where contact and correspondence with foreign \ncitizens are casual and infrequent because the risk of foreign exploitation or pressure is \nless. Applicant visits and provides financial support to his mother and daughter. He \nremains married to his wife and they have discussions regarding their daughter. These \ncontacts are not casual and infrequent. I find mitigating condition (c) does not apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant became a U.S. citizen in \n2006. He has been married since 1997 and has a daughter. Both his wife and daughter \nare citizens and residents of Sri Lanka. Applicant\u2019s mother is a citizen and resident of \nSri Lanka. She receives a government pension. Applicant occasionally sees his \nparents-in-law when visiting his daughter, but has minimal emotional contact with them. \nHe visits his mother and daughter regularly. He provides financial support to both. He \ntalks on the phone to them. He has less contact with his wife. He has no family in the \nU.S., but does have assets here. His last contact with his brother was at his father\u2019s \nfuneral. He does not maintain regular contact with him. Considering his contacts, Sri \nLanka\u2019s human rights record, and the potential conflict of interest, Applicant has not met \nhis burden of persuasion. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under the \nForeign Influence guideline.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d.-1.e: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly in the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Applicant is a 42-year-old network systems administrator employed by a defense contractor. He finished high school in 1986, and is currently attending college. He expects to receive his bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science in April 2010. Applicant married his wife in February 1990, and they have two children. Between 1990 and 1997, his wife was employed full-time and she contributed to the household financial situation. In 1997, his wife was unemployed for a period because of complications with the delivery of one of their children. In 1997, Applicant filed for bankruptcy protection and all of his unsecured financial obligations were discharged. (Tr. 80-82) Applicant filed his first security clearance application in May 2009. In it, he disclosed having numerous delinquent debts. His background investigation addressed his financial problems. The SOR alleges 24 delinquent debts totaling approximately $65,000. He attributed his financial problems to periods of unemployment, underemployment, and his separation from his wife from 2004 until 2007. Because of his reduced income and the separation from his wife, he was not making sufficient money to pay for his day",

He failed to mitigate \nfinancial considerations security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 12, 2009, Applicant submitted a security clearance application. On \nSeptember 30, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as revised; and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  \n \nThe \nSOR \nalleges \nsecurity \nconcerns \nunder \nGuideline \nF \n(Financial \nConsiderations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary \nMay 17, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to \nan administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted or denied. \n \nApplicant\u2019s undated response to the SOR allegations was received by DOHA on \nOctober 7, 2009. He requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was \nassigned to me on December 16, 2009. DOHA issued the notice of hearing on January \n22, 2010, convening a hearing on February 4, 2010. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled. The Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 9, which were \nadmitted without objections. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1 \nthrough 7, which were admitted without objection. AE 7 was received post-hearing. \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 16, 2010.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted 23 of the 24 SOR allegations. He denied the allegation in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough \nreview of the evidence of record, and having considered Applicant\u2019s demeanor and \ntestimony, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old network systems administrator employed by a defense \ncontractor. He finished high school in 1986, and is currently attending college. He \nexpects to receive his bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science in April 2010. Applicant \nmarried his wife in February 1990, and they have two children. \n \nBetween 1990 and 1997, his wife was employed full-time and she contributed to \nthe household financial situation. In 1997, his wife was unemployed for a period \nbecause of complications with the delivery of one of their children. In 1997, Applicant \nfiled for bankruptcy protection and all of his unsecured financial obligations were \ndischarged. (Tr. 80-82) \n \nApplicant filed his first security clearance application in May 2009. In it, he \ndisclosed having numerous delinquent debts. His background investigation addressed \nhis financial problems. The SOR alleges 24 delinquent debts totaling approximately \n$65,000. He attributed his financial problems to periods of unemployment, \nunderemployment, and his separation from his wife from 2004 until 2007. Because of \nhis reduced income and the separation from his wife, he was not making sufficient \nmoney to pay for his day-to-day financial obligations and his delinquent debts.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s employment history shows he was fully employed with diverse \nemployers from January 1993 until 2006. He was unemployed from September 2006 \nuntil March 2007. He had a temporary job from March 2007 until December 2007. In \nDecember 2007, he was hired full-time by his current employer, a government \ncontractor. Additionally, Applicant has held a part-time job as a fitness instructor from \nJuly 2000 to present.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant separated from his wife in June 2004. He did not pay child support \nbecause he was not allowed access to his children. In 2005, his wife secured court-\nordered child support for $1,500 a month, including arrearages. During his 2006 periods \nof unemployment, Applicant sought relief from the $1,500 court-ordered child support, \nbut the court denied relief. Because of the court-ordered child support and his periods of \nunemployment, he was not able to pay his truck note and returned it to the dealership. \nHe had purchased the truck new in 2002. He also was evicted from his apartment in \n2006. He moved in with his mother to save money and to be able to pay his child \nsupport obligation.  \n \nApplicant and his wife reconciled in February 2007. His wife worked from \nJanuary to September 2008, and they were able to do better with their financial \nproblems for some time. However, she has been unemployed since. Applicant\u2019s \npersonal financial statement shows he was making approximately $3,800 a month, \nincluding $600 he makes on his part-time job. His monthly living expenses add up to \n$3,000. They have approximately $535 in monthly disposable income.  \n \nAs of his hearing date, Applicant had made payment arrangements to satisfy the \nfollowing debts:  \n \n1. SOR \u00b6 1.a. The total debt owed is $37,362. The creditor filed suit against him, \nthey settled the debt in 2009, and he made sporadic payments in October 2009 ($250), \nDecember 2009 ($500), and February 2010 ($250) (AE 7).  \n \n2. SOR \u00b6 1.i. Applicant owes approximately $15,000 to the IRS for overdue \nincome taxes. He established an installment agreement in 2007, and has been paying \napproximately $125 a month since through a wage garnishment (AE 7). \n \n3. He owes $2,000 on back taxes to a state and claimed he settled the debt and \nwas paying $100 monthly. AE 1 shows he has a payment agreement with the state and \nthat he issued a bad check to cover this debt. He has not been able to make consistent \npayments, but intends to pay the debt as soon as his financial situation stabilizes. \n \n4. SOR \u00b6 1.l alleged a $605 debt to a collection agency. AE 2 shows he has a \npayment agreement with the creditor to pay $50 monthly. The evidence does not show \nwhen he established the payment agreement, whether he has been making consistent \nmonthly payments, or if he is current with his payment agreement.  \n  \n5. AE 3 shows Applicant has a payment agreement with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 \n1.n. The evidence does not show when he established the payment agreement, \nwhether he has been making consistent monthly payments, or if he is current with his \npayment agreement. \n \n6. Applicant also claimed he settled and was paying on the debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.v. SOR \u00b6 1.k alleged a $4,157 debt to another state for overdue income \ntaxes. He claimed he made a payment agreement to pay $193 a month for 24 months. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nHe has not been able to make consistent payments, but intends to pay the debt as soon \nas his financial situation stabilizes. He presented no documentary evidence to support \nhis claims. \n \nApplicant testified he has not contacted, made payment arrangements, or made \nany other attempts to resolve any of the remaining alleged SOR debts because he does \nnot have the financial means to resolve the debts. Based on Applicant\u2019s credit reports, \nhis testimony, and his statements, I find that Applicant is responsible for all the \ndelinquent debts alleged in the SOR. His liabilities total approximately $65,000. These \ndebts are not resolved. \n \nApplicant testified he and his wife have a budget and they try to follow it. His plan \nis to pay some of the large debts first and then address the other smaller debts. He \nunderwent financial counseling approximately 10 years ago when he filed for \nbankruptcy protection. He has not received financial counseling recently. He is against \ncontracting for the services of a debt management company because he does not have \nthe money to pay for their services. He believes he can handle his financial situation on \nhis own. He presented no evidence of any prior financial counseling, participation in \nconsumer debt consolidation programs, or that he was following a budget. It appears he \nhas made payment arrangements only after legal action was initiated against him. \n \nApplicant was forthcoming about his past and present financial situation. He \nhighlighted his good performance for his employer and that he is considered a valued \nemployee. There is no evidence that Applicant has compromised or caused others to \ncompromise classified information.  \n \nApplicant expressed remorse for his financial problems and averred he has \nalways intended to pay his delinquent debts. He promised to make satisfactory payment \narrangements with all of his creditors sometime in the future.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                           \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d1 Once the \nGovernment has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden \nshifts to applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts \nadmitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Directive \n\u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \ngovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the security concern is that failure or inability to live within \none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \n \n1 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore \nthan a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d \n375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                           \nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having \nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts were discharged through bankruptcy in 1997.2 The SOR \nalleged 24 delinquent debts. Applicant and his spouse are responsible for all of the \nalleged delinquent debs, many of which have been delinquent for many years. Their \ntotal liability is approximately $65,000 in unresolved SOR debt. AG \u00b6 19(a): inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts; and AG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial \nobligations, apply. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \nApplicant presented documentary evidence to show that he has settled and \nmade some payments on six of the alleged debts. However, it appears he has made \npayment arrangements only after legal action was initiated against him. He also \nestablished some circumstances beyond his control, which contributed to his inability to \n \n2 The SOR did not allege that Applicant failed to disclose these debts under Guideline F or E. As such, \nthis information cannot be used to deny Applicant\u2019s security clearance. Notwithstanding, I may consider \nany behavior not alleged in the SOR to: assess his credibility; evaluate his evidence of extenuation, \nmitigation, or changed circumstances; assess his possible rehabilitation; determine the applicability of the \nAGs; and conduct the whole-person analysis. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \npay his debts, i.e., his and his wife\u2019s periods of unemployment and underemployment, \nand their four-year separation. I find AG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies, but does not fully \nmitigate the financial concerns. Applicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to show he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances.  \n \n \nThe evidence shows Applicant and his wife do not have a track record of \nfinancial responsibility. He presented little evidence of debt payments, contacts with \ncreditors, or negotiations to resolve his SOR debts. Considering the evidence as a \nwhole, his financial problems are not under control. Applicant receives credit for \ncontacting some of his creditors and establishing payment plans. However, his evidence \ndoes not show he has been paying consistently on his payment plans except when his \npay is garnished. It is too soon to determine whether he has a viable plan to resolve his \nfinancial predicament or that he will be able to avoid similar financial problems in the \nfuture. \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (c), (d), (e), and (f) do not apply because Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems are not yet under control, and he did not participate in recent financial \ncounseling. He also failed to show he made good-faith efforts to resolve his debts, \nbecause it appears he has made payment arrangements only after legal action was \ninitiated against him. His actions cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, \nand judgment. Despite partial applicability of AG \u00b6 20(b), financial considerations \nconcerns are not mitigated. Applicant has not demonstrated his financial responsibility \nby taking sufficient timely actions to resolve his debts.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \n\n \n8 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant is a mature man and a good \nworker. He has continued his education with a view to improve his financial situation. He \nhas worked well for his employer. There is no evidence he has ever compromised or \ncaused others to compromise classified information. These factors show some \nresponsibility, good judgment, and mitigation. Applicant also established some \ncircumstances beyond his control, which contributed to his inability to pay his debts. His \ncurrent financial problems primarily seem be the result of his separation from his wife. \n \n \nNotwithstanding, Applicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to show he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. He and his wife have been together since 2007 \nand he has been fully employed since December 2007. Applicant should have been \nmore diligent and made greater efforts sooner to resolve his delinquent debts. His \ndocumented steps are simply inadequate to fully mitigate financial considerations \nconcerns. \n \n \nApplicant has made payment arrangements when he has been legally forced to \ndo so. His favorable information fails to show financial responsibility and good judgment. \nHe has made little effort to resolve his financial obligations. He presented little \ndocumentary evidence of debt payments or contacts with creditors to resolve his debts. \nHis financial problems are not under control. It is too soon to determine whether he can \nestablish a viable financial plan to resolve his current problems and whether he has \nlearned to avoid similar financial problems in the future.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.x: \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant eligibility for a security clearance for \nApplicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n_______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOWE, Philip S., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant (who changed his surname to his wife\u2019s upon his marriage in 2009 and \nis not the name used in the SOR) (Tr. 3, 7) submitted his Questionnaire for Public Trust \nPosition (SF 85P), on February 22, 2008. On April 22, 2009, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the \ntrustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) for Applicant. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation \n5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as amended (Regulation); and \nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 27, 2009, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed \nOctober 30, 2009\n\n \n \n \n2\non June 11, 2009. I received the case assignment on June 11, 2009. DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on July 9, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on July 30, \n2009. The government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 8, which were received without \nobjection.  Applicant testified and wanted the opportunity to submit exhibits after the \nhearing. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on August 7, 2009. I granted \nApplicant=s request to keep the record open until August 13, 2009, to submit additional \nmatters.  On August 4, 2009, he submitted his Exhibits A to E without objection. The \nrecord closed on August 5, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR Applicant admitted the factual allegations in && 1.a, \n1.pp, 1.qq., and 1.rr of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the factual allegations in \n&& 1.b through 1.oo.of the SOR. He also provided additional information to support his \nrequest for eligibility for a public trust position.   \n \nApplicant is 28 years old. He works as a customer service representative for a \ndefense contractor in the health care industry.  He has been employed there for about \none year. Prior to this employment, he worked for several companies in the hotel and \nfood industries. Applicant has a high school degree, and is attempting to attend college \nto obtain a business degree. (Tr. 36, 63, 67, 83; Exhibit 1) \n \nApplicant married his present wife on March 14, 2009. They are expecting a child \nin October 2009. Applicant\u2019s wife has a child from a prior relationship whom Applicant \nhas adopted. Applicant also has a child from a prior relationship with another woman.  \nHe has joint custody of that child, and does not pay child support. Applicant was married \nfrom February 2006 to January 2007 to a third woman. She took his money and went to \nlive with another man, so Applicant petitioned to have that marriage annulled. The \npetition was granted. Applicant\u2019s first wife wrote checks and took money from their \naccounts without telling Applicant. When Applicant wrote checks subsequent to those \nactions, there were insufficient funds in the checking account. Applicant was then \ncharged with writing checks with insufficient funds. Applicant\u2019s present wife manages \ntheir money to make certain their current bills are paid on time each month. (Tr. 34-40, \n61, 79-82; Exhibit 8) \n \nApplicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in April 2005 for debts he incurred from \n2001 to 2005. His debts were discharged in bankruptcy in August 2005. His secured \nand unsecured debts in that bankruptcy totaled $97,772. He could not pay those debts \nbecause he received a head injury on the job in 2001, and could only work part-time \nafter that event.  He based his spending habits on his income before his injury and later \nafter his recovery. (Tr. 45, 51-56, 87-89, 92-94; Exhibits 6, 7, A, E) \n \nApplicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy on April 29, 2009, to pay $126,800 in \nsecured and unsecured delinquent debts he incurred from 2006 to the filing date. The \nfiling fee for that type of bankruptcy is $274, payable upon filing. Applicant agreed to \n\n \n \n \n3\npay his attorney $2,925, of which he paid $1,425 prior to the petition filing.  He owes his \nattorney $1,500. The bankruptcy trustee\u2019s fee is not set forth in any exhibit. This fee \nmust be paid from the monthly payments Applicant makes. The federal bankruptcy \nstatute and rules require any petitioner such as Applicant is to complete \u201can instructional \ncourse in personal financial management in order to receive a discharge under Chapter \n13,\u201d as stated in the Chapter 13 Introduction Letter Applicant submitted as Exhibit E. \nApplicant did not submit a copy of that certificate. The Chapter 13 plan petition dated \nApril 29, 2009, and signed only by Applicant, lists his proposed payments to be $75 \nmonthly deducted automatically from his paycheck and sent to the bankruptcy trustee. \nThe payment proposal would require Applicant to make 36 payments, for a total debt \nrepayment amount of $2,700 on a debt of $126,800. This monthly payment amount and \nthe total repayment amount are calculated on Applicant\u2019s assets and income to \ndetermine his ability to repay the debts listed in the bankruptcy, according to Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony at the hearing. Applicant did not offer a copy of a Bankruptcy Court order \nconfirming his proposed plan. No objections from the creditors were shown, if they \nexisted. (Tr. 45, 51-56, 87-89, 92-94; Exhibits 6, 7, A, E) \n \nThe SOR lists 40 delinquent debts totaling $45,000. All those debts are included \nin the Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing (subparagraphs 1.c to 1.oo). Applicant paid only the \npayday loan amount of $989 by garnishment (subparagraph 1.b) and the restitution for \nthe worthless check charge in 2006 (subparagraph 1.rr). Applicant paid $2,324.47 for \nthe check and $609.21 to the court for costs. He also satisfied the one-year probation \nperiod he received as part of his sentence in that criminal action. The delinquent debts \nin both bankruptcies include credit card debts, car loans, cell telephone service bills, \nand store purchases.(Tr. 42, 59, 75, 86; Exhibits 2-6, A-E) \n \nApplicant has a car his wife owns without any debt. They purchased a new car in \n2009 for about $16,000 with a loan secured by a $20,000 certificate of deposit. This \nmoney came from his wife\u2019s inheritance ($17,000) and $3,000 Applicant contributed \nfrom money he did not spend from his federal and state education grants. Applicant has \nthree credit cards, one used for furniture purchases, one card used for gas purchases, \nand the third card used for other purchases and to reestablish his credit after his first \nbankruptcy. The balances on those cards are paid monthly on time. Applicant\u2019s take-\nhome pay is about $2,000 monthly. Applicant\u2019s income over the past eight years has \nbeen between $24,000 and $30,000. Around 2001, Applicant made about $60,000 from \ntwo jobs. From this income, he may have $200 to $500 in discretionary income each \nmonth. He pays $300 to $500 monthly for rent because he lives with his wife\u2019s family. \n(Tr. 57, 58, 62-70, 96-99; Exhibits 4, 5, B-D) \n \nApplicant was charged in 2002 for issuing a worthless check, but the charge was \ndismissed because the bank made a mistake in processing a financial document and \nApplicant did not have a checking account at that time (subparagraph 1.pp). In May \n2003, Applicant was charged with writing another worthless check. He pled guilty and \nwas fined (subparagraph 1.qq.). Applicant\u2019s court record in his home state shows nine \njudgments against him totaling $13,106. These judgments were not paid, and are \nincluded in Applicant\u2019s Chapter 13 bankruptcy. (Tr. 73-76; Exhibits 8-a to 8-m) \n\n \n \n \n4\nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as Asensitive positions.@  \n(See Regulation && C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.) AThe standard that must be met for \n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the \nperson=s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.@ (See \nRegulation & C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation & C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating the Applicant=s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge=s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG & 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the Awhole-person concept.@ \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG & 2(b) \nrequires that A[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.@ In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive & E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive & E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting Awitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .@ The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n\n \n \n \n5\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be Ain \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.@ See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations \nis set out in AG & 18:   \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes nine conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and \nmay be disqualifying.  Of these conditions, four are applicable to Applicant\u2019s situation.  \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the \nabsence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or \nestablish a realistic plan to pay the debt; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(e) consistent spending beyond one's means, which may be indicated by \nexcessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ratio, and/or other financial analysis. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s actions demonstrate poor self-control and serious lack of financial \njudgment.  His unpaid debts started in 2001 when he lost his job because of work-\nrelated injury, and his lack of any reasonable plan to repay them from his income or \nassets are of serious trustworthiness concern. He filed two types of personal bankruptcy \npetitions to eliminate his debts.  He obtained a discharge order in his Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy in 2005.  He started his Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2009.  It has not been \nconcluded. \n \n\n \n \n \n6\n \nUnder AG & 19(a), Applicant has 40 delinquent debts totaling $45,000 listed in \nthe SOR.  He repaid one debt by having his paycheck garnished.  Applicant declared he \ndoes not have the money or income to repay these debts.   \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b) applies because Applicant borrowed so much money he could not \nrepay it from an income of $24,000 annually. His first bankruptcy debts totaled $97,772.  \nHis latest bankruptcy debts total $126,800. The total of these two bankruptcy filings is \n$224,572 spent in eight years by a man now 28 years old. Applicant spent money \nirresponsibly, and had no \u201cgood-faith\u201d plan or possibility of repaying either set of debts, \nabsent bankruptcy protection. \n \n \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), he has not repaid any of these excessive debts.  He \nhas an eight-year history of not making payments on these debts. The debts go back to \n2001. \n \n  \nApplicant consistently spent beyond his means to repay the debt. His debt \namount, his declared lack of funds to repay these debts, coupled with his high debt-to-\nincome ratio, shows AG \u00b6 19(e) is applicable.  \n \n \nHis irresponsible attitude toward his delinquent debts is also shown in the various \njudgments and punitive actions entered against him for various financial transactions \nbetween 2001 and 2007.  There is a  pattern of money mismanagement shown in these \nsituations which also support the application of these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides six conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nunder this guideline.  Of these six conditions, three may apply to the Applicant\u2019s \nsituation: \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were caused in some part by his job loss in 2001, \nwhich significantly reduced his income and ability to repay his debts.  He spent money \nin that time based on his ability to repay it from his two incomes, but the loss of one job \nthrew his debt repayment plans into an untenable position. His first wife\u2019s spending \nhabits added to some of his debt problems after 2006. That fact, coupled with his failure \nto coordinate their check-writing, caused the worthless check charges to be levied \n\n \n \n \n7\nagainst Applicant.  He took action immediately to terminate that marriage because of \nthe financial and personal issues his first wife caused. Yet none of these explanations or \nexcuses can show Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances by spending \n$224,572 in eight years, a sum he never could repay with his lack of college education \nor jobs paying substantially higher salaries. Applicant spent, and spent borrowed \nmoney, with abandon and disdain for his legal and more obligations to repay it. AG \u00b6 \n20(b) has no applicability. \n \n \nApplicant is supposed to receive counseling on personal finances in accordance \nwith the federal bankruptcy statute and rules. He cannot receive a discharge under \nChapter 13 until he completes that counseling. Yet, Applicant, who has the burden of \nproof that a mitigating condition should apply to his case, did not submit any evidence of \nany counseling under the bankruptcy statute, nor under any consumer counseling \nprogram, or done on his own initiative. AG \u00b6 20 (c) has no applicability. \n \n \nApplicant initiated the 2005 Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding to eliminate his \ndebts. It was the only legal method he had available to resolve the debts, because his \nincome would never have allowed him to repay the debts. Then, in 2009, he started a \nChapter 13 bankruptcy to repay in a small amount his latest accumulation of delinquent \ndebts in the amount of $126,800. The bankruptcy action is a legitimate procedure \nprovided for in federal statutes to resolve debts, but in Applicant\u2019s situation it is not a \n\u201cgood-faith\u201d effort. Applicant wantonly spent money he borrowed with no realistic \npossibility of repaying it. His bankruptcy documents for the Chapter 13 do not show the \nplan of $75 monthly and a total payment of $2,700 over three years has been approved \nby the bankruptcy judge. Furthermore, Applicant and his wife have $20,000 in the bank \nwhich they pledged to buy a new car. This action is an example of how Applicant \ncontinues to spend money for his own advantage while not repaying his legitimate \ndelinquent debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \n \n \nNo mitigating conditions apply to Applicant\u2019s 13 judgments and criminal code \noffenses involving unpaid debts and the writing of worthless checks incurred between \n2001 and 2007.   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant=s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \nApplicant=s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n \n \n8\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was young and had only a \nhigh school degree when he started employment and earning an income.  He was \nirresponsible in spending money he could never hope to repay from his average \n$24,000 annual income. He took steps in 2005 and 2009 to file bankruptcy actions to \nresolve his debts. They were the only mechanisms available to him to satisfy the \nmagnitude of his delinquent debts.  However, the magnitude of $224,572 in delinquent \ndebt over eight years, with almost none of it repaid, shows serious and repeated \nmisconduct.  Applicant learned nothing from his experiences, especially his 2005 \nChapter 7 bankruptcy. He just spends and spends, and does not repay substantial \nportions of his delinquent debts. He voluntarily spent all this borrowed money and \nshowed no rehabilitation based on any time period.  It is likely his spending habits will \nrecur based on his history of spending borrowed money, as is shown by his recent car \npurchase.  There is potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress resulting \nfrom the magnitude of his debts and the repeated spending pattern he exhibits. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant=s \neligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant did not mitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.  I conclude the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept against Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.rr:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n9\nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \npublic trust position. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nPHILIP S. HOWE \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the trustworthiness concerns under\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) on March 1,\n2011. The action was taken under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); Department of Defense Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security\nProgram, dated January 1987, as amended (Regulation); and the Adjudicative\nGuidelines For Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG)\nimplemented on September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 7, 2011. She answered\nthe SOR in writing on May 10, 2011 and requested a hearing before an administrative\njudge. DOHA received the request, and Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\non June 6, 2011. I received the case assignment on June 20, 2011. DOHA issued a\nNovember 16, 2011\n\nGE 1; AE D; AE F; AE K; AE L; Tr. 74.\n1\nGE 1; AE P; Tr. 24-25, 52-53.\n2\n2\nnotice of hearing on July 8, 2011, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on July 27,\n2011. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 11, which were received and\nadmitted without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Exhibits (AE) A through F,\nwhich were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing\n(Tr.) on August 11, 2011. I held the record open until August 26, 2011, for the\nsubmission of additional matters. Applicant timely submitted AE G through AE R, which\nwere admitted without objection. The record closed on August 26, 2011.\nProcedural Ruling\nMotion to Amend SOR\nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR to correct the account number in\nSOR allegation 1.i. Applicant did not object.  Department Counsel\u2019s motion was\ngranted, and the SOR is amended to reflect the correct account number. (Tr. at 9.)\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a,\n1.e, 1.u-1.y, 1.ee, 1.hh, 1.jj, 1.kk, 2.a, 2.c-2.e, and 2.g-2.q of the SOR. She denied the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d, 1.f-1.t, 1.z-1.dd, 1.ff, 1.ii, 1.ll-1.nn, 2.b, 2.f, 2.r, and 2.s\nof the SOR. She also provided some additional information to support her request for\neligibility for a public trust position.  \nApplicant, who is 32 years old, works as a beneficiary support representative for\na Department of Defense contractor. She began working for her employer in February\n2008. Her employer promoted her to her current position in July 2011. She received\ngenerally acceptable performance evaluations.1\nApplicant graduated from high school and is applying to college with a goal of\nattaining an associate of arts degree. She is engaged and plans to marry in the fall. She\nhas two children: a daughter, age 12 and a son, age 2. Both children live with her. She\ndoes not receive child support for her daughter, but she has obtained the paperwork to\nfile for child support from her daughter\u2019s father. She plans to file this request when she\nhas accumulated sufficient leave to request a day from work.2\nDuring her investigative interview, Applicant advised the security investigator that\nshe had experienced difficulties with her federal taxes beginning in 2006. Both she and\nher daughter\u2019s father claimed a tax deduction for her daughter. Even though her\ndaughter lives with her, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) gave the deduction to her\ndaughter\u2019s father because Applicant did not have receipts showing her daughter lives\nwith her. Because of this decision, she owed taxes. Since this time, she placed her\ndaughter\u2019s name on the rental agreement, which is sufficient proof to the IRS that her\n\nGE 2; AE B; Tr. 26-27, 29-31, 56-58.\n3\nGE 2 - GE 5; GE 7; GE 8; AE C; Tr. 33-37, 44-47, 68-73.\n4\nResponse to the SOR; GE 9 - GE 11.\n5\n3\ndaughter lives with her. An order of child support will help with this IRS issue in the\nfuture as she must show the IRS each year that she is the primary care giver for her\ndaughter. The IRS took her refunds for several years, and her debt is paid. She\nprovided documentation showing her taxes as computed by a professional.3\nAround 2000, Applicant purchased a car and insured it. She later ceased her\ninsurance premium payments as she lacked sufficient income. The lack of insurance\nresulted in an inability to register her car. She continued to drive the car without the\ninsurance and registration. In October 2001, the police stopped her and charged her\nwith speeding and no registration. A month later, the police charged her with no current\nregistration and no proof of insurance, which resulted in a $443 fine. The police\narrested her twice in 2002 on similar charges, and the court fined her. She lacked\nincome to pay her fines, which caused her driver\u2019s license to be suspended. Between\nMarch 2003 and April 2006, the police arrested her numerous times for driving on a\nsuspended driver\u2019s license, speeding, no proof of insurance, no registration card, child\nrestraint violation, failure to appear, and violation of a promise to appear. Each arrest\nresulted in more fines and an occasional overnight in jail. She spent one week in jail\nafter an arrest in 2006 on a failure to appear warrant. She decided to stop driving after\nher October 2007 citation because she did not want to return to jail. However, she was\nagain arrested in 2009 for driving on a suspended driver\u2019s license and failure to appear.\nDuring these years, several bench warrants were issued for her arrest because she did\nnot appear in court on her traffic citations. Over the years, she paid some court fees\nand fines, but lacked sufficient income to pay all her fines and court costs. She currently\nowes approximately $10,000 on her fines and fees, due, in part, to interest charges on\nher unpaid fines.4\nThe SOR identified 40 purportedly continuing delinquencies as reflected by credit\nreports from 2008, 2009, and 2011, totaling approximately $54,000. Some accounts\nhave been transferred, reassigned, or sold to other creditors or collection agents. Other\naccounts are referenced repeatedly in both credit reports, in many instances duplicating\nother accounts listed, either under the same creditor or collection agency name or\nunder a different creditor or collection agency name. Some accounts are identified by\ncomplete account numbers, while others are identified by partial account numbers, in\nsome instances eliminating the last four digits and in others eliminating other digits.\nThe SOR identifies nine medical debts (1.c - 1.f, 1.i-1.k, and 1.dd), but does not\nname the creditor in eight of these bills. Applicant denied owing eight of these bills and\nadmitted owing the $561 medical bill in allegation 1.e. Applicant believes her insurance\npaid these bills, but she did not provide proof that these debts are resolved.5\n\nGE 3; GE 4; GE 9 - GE 11; AE C; Tr. 33-37, 68-73.\n6\nGE 9 - GE 11; AE I; Tr. 35.\n7\nGE 2, p. 34; GE 9 - GE 11; AE J; AE N.\n8\nGE 2; Tr. 28, 52, 62. \n9\n4\nThe SOR lists seven debts (1.o-1.r, 1.ff, 1.kk, and 1.ll) owed to three city\ngovernments. Applicant believes the debts in SOR allegations 1.o-1.r are the same as\nthe debt listed in allegation 1.ll. She may be right, but she has not provided current\ndocumentation from the cities, which shows what she owes and what she has paid.\nShe made some payments on these debts in the past, but admits that she owes about\n$10,000 to one city for motor vehicles fines, related court costs, and interest on her\nunpaid debts.6\nThe SOR identifies five judgments (1.s - 1.w, and 1.nn). Four of the judgments\nrelate to rental apartments also listed in SOR paragraphs 1.y - 1.cc, and appear to be\nduplicates. Applicant verified that she paid the $3,109 judgment in allegation 1.nn in full\nin 2010 through a garnishment of her pay. The remaining debts are only listed on the\nMarch 5, 2008 credit report. Applicant has not provided any information verifying that\nthese debts are paid or that the debts were removed from her credit report because the\ndebts are not hers. There is no evidence that the remaining judgments or debts have\nbeen resolved. The debts and judgments listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.s to 1.jj are only listed on\nthe March 5, 2008 credit report. The debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o to 1.r are not listed on\nthe January 3, 2011 credit report. Because of the age of many of these debts and\njudgments, they may have dropped off her credit report. Except for the judgments,\nthese debts are barred from collection under the State Statute of Limitations.\nJudgments in her state must be renewed every five years to be enforceable.7\nApplicant has two unpaid telephone debts listed in the SOR. The $361 debt in\nallegation 1.ii is the same as the $361 debt in allegation 1.a and the debt in 1.b.\nApplicant stated that she paid the debts in allegation 1.h ($41) and 1.jj ($145), but has\nnot provided adequate verification of her payment. The remaining debts listed in the\nSOR are not paid.8\nApplicant attributes her financial problems to bad judgment because she was\nimmature and a single mother and to sporadic employment and low paying jobs, leaving\nher with insufficient income to cover her expenses over a substantial period of time. Her\ncurrent position has helped her to stabilize her finances, but her current income is\ninsufficient to pay her old debts. Her fianc\u00e9 lives with her. He recently began working\nafter nine months of unemployment during which time he provided child care.9\nWith her promotion in July 2011, she earns $14.92 an hour. Her leave and\nearnings statement reflect her current gross biweekly income as $1,193 and her net\nbiweekly income as $994, for a total net monthly income of $1,988. Her monthly\nexpenses include $875 for rent, $60 for a cell phone, $200 for daycare, $250 for food,\n$100 for utilities, $40 for transportation, and $200 miscellaneous. Her fianc\u00e9 earns $12\n\nGE 2; AE O; AE Q; Tr. 62-63.\n10\nAE A; AE G; AE M; AE R; Tr. 32, 38, 39, 64-67, 99, 100.\n11\nGE 2, p. 55, Tr. 48-49.\n12\nGE 2, p. 55; Tr. 49-50.\n13\n5\nan hour, but his actual monthly income and his contribution to household expenses are\nunknown.10\nApplicant paid $260 to a credit counseling company to help resolve her debts,\nbut the company provided no assistance to her. She met with a bankruptcy attorney in\nJuly 2011. She decided to retain the attorney with a goal of filing for Chapter 7. She\npays the attorney $200 a month, and when she pays the $1,700 requested payment,\nthe attorney will begin the process to file her bankruptcy petition. She understands that\nher debt to the city for parking fines, court fees, and interest will not be discharged in\nbankruptcy. She plan to use her future tax refunds to pay these debts.11\nWhen she completed her SF 85P, Applicant answered \u201cyes\u201d to question 16,\nwhich asked: \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or\nconvicted of any offense(s)? (leave out traffic fines of less than $150).\u201d Applicant listed\none arrest in 2002, but not her other arrests. She denies intentionally falsifying her\nanswer, stating that she misunderstood the question. She thought that if she listed one\narrest, the court records would provide the information on her other arrests.12\nApplicant answered \u201cno\u201d to question 20 on her SF 85P, which asked if she was\nnow over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial obligation. She did not have any\nloans and misunderstood the extent of information sought by the question. She denies\nintentionally falsifying her answers. When she met with the security clearance\ninvestigator in 2008, she agreed that her answer to this question should have been\n\u201cyes\u201d after the investigator explained the scope of the question.13\nPolicies\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d\n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for\n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the\nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to\nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See\nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence\nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness\nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service\nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are\nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final\nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)  \n\n6\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the\nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of\nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in\nthe adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a\nfair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is\na conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nsensitive information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin\nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty\nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple\nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations\nis set out in AG & 18:  \n\n7\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.\nUnder AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially\ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@\nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt between 2000 and\n2010. She has been unable to pay her past-due debts for a significant period of time.\nThe evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a\ncloser examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate\ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the\ndisqualifying condition may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago,\nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.@ Applicant=s financial problems have been ongoing for ten years and\ncontinue to be a problem. Because her debts are recent, frequent, and not the  result of\nunusual circumstances, this mitigating condition is not applicable. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems arose for many reasons, including low income and unemployment. Applicant\nlacks and has lacked sufficient income to pay her current expenses and her past-due\ndebts. I find this potentially mitigating condition is partially applicable. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant paid the judgment listed in SOR\nallegation 1.nn and this allegation is found in favor of Applicant under this mitigating\ncondition. Applicant sought help from a credit counseling company without success.\nHowever, her financial problems are not yet resolved. This mitigating condition is\npartially applicable.\nSimilarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant\ncontinually makes a good faith effort to work with the IRS concerning the tax issues\ncreated by her daughter\u2019s father. Her efforts have led to the resolution of any debt she\nmay owe the IRS. This mitigating condition applies to SOR allegation 1.mm.\n\n8\nThe mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(e) and 20(f) two are not applicable in this\ncase.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security\nclearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning\nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent\nmedical authority, or other official government representative;\n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is\nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single\nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not\nproperly safeguard protected information;\n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any\nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse\ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the\nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes\nbut is not limited to consideration of:\n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of\nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information,\nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or other\ngovernment protected information:\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004) (explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n14\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\n9\n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the\nworkplace; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and,\n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other\nemployer's time or resources.\n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct,\nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such\nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's\npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another\ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is\nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a\nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence\nservice or other group;\n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to\nthe employer as a condition of employment; and,\n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity. \nFor AG \u00b6 16(a) to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission must be deliberate. The\nGovernment established that Applicant omitted material facts from her February 2008\nSF 85P, when she failed to list all her arrests for traffic violations and to acknowledge\ndebts more than 180 days past-due. In her response to the SOR and at the hearing,\nshe denied that she intentionally falsified her answers to these questions. When the\nallegation of falsification is controverted, the Government has the burden of proving it.\nProof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent\nor state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the\nrecord evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial\nevidence concerning an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission\noccurred.14\nApplicant listed a 2002 arrest, but did not realize that she needed to list all her\narrests. She believed that by listing one arrest, a check of the court records would\nreveal her remaining arrests. Her belief about the court records was correct, but an\nincorrect assumption for completing her SF 85P. While her assumption is incorrect, it\ndoes not equate to intentional falsification. SOR allegation 2.r is found in Applicant\u2019s\nfavor.\nLikewise, Applicant\u2019s misunderstanding of the information sought concerning her\npast debts does not equate to intentional falsification of her answer to question 20. She\nanswered the question \u201cno\u201d because she focused on the term \u201cloans\u201d, and she did not\n\n10\nhave any loans, although she knew she had debt. When she met with the investigator,\nshe agreed that her answer should have been \u201cyes\u201d after the investigator explained the\nscope of the question.\nApplicant\u2019s multiple arrests for motor vehicle violations, such as no proof of\ninsurance, no registration, speeding, and driving on a suspended license, show an\ninability to follow the rules of the road. She also failed to appear in court on many\noccasions, which also reflects her inability to comply with court orders. The Government\nhas established its prima facie case under AG \u00b6 16(d)(3).\nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;\n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was\ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of\nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual\nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made\naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the\nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully.\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur;\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;\n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable\nreliability; and,\n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or\noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules\nand regulations.\nI have reviewed all the evidence of record and have considered Applicant\u2019s\nhonest and forthright testimony about the events leading to her multiple arrests. She no\nlonger drives, as she does not want to be arrested and placed in jail for any period of\ntime. By not driving, she cannot violate the rules of the road. However, given her\n\nApplicant intends to include all her past-due debts listed in her credit reports in her Chapter 7 filing. Recent\n15\ncredit reports do not list all the SOR debts that Applicant states she will resolve through bankruptcy. Applicant\ndoes have a copy of her credit reports from 2008 forward.\n11\nmultiple violations of the motor vehicle laws, her potential to do so once she regains her\ndriver\u2019s license remains a concern as she has not taken a driver\u2019s refresher course to\nshow that she fully understands her obligations as a driver on the roads of her state.\nShe has not mitigated the security concerns raised by her rules violations.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the\napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider\nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n\u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public\ntrust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. The decision to grant or\ndeny a trustworthiness determination requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors,\nboth favorable and unfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the\nevidence of record, not a single item in isolation, to determine if a trustworthiness\nconcern is established and then whether it is mitigated. A determination of an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position should not be made as punishment for\nspecific past conduct, but on a reasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of\nrecord to decide if a nexus exists between established facts and a legitimate\ntrustworthiness concern.\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant\u2019s financial problems first\nbegan when she was a young woman, trying to support a child on a limited income. Her\nscare resources led to poor financial decisions and unpaid debts. Her financial situation\nhas improved, but she still has significant unresolved debts. She hired a bankruptcy\nattorney and will proceed to file bankruptcy once she pays the requested fees, hopefully\nby January 2012. Most of her debts are not yet resolved and will not be resolved until\nher bankruptcy case is completed next year.  She fully acknowledges a significant debt\n15\nto the city for her traffic violations, but she does not have a sustainable plan in place to\n\n12\npay this debt. She is not even paying a small amount on her debt each month, which\nwould show a good faith effort to resolve this debt.\nApplicant needed transportation and decided to continue driving her vehicle\nwhen she did not have insurance and lacked proper registration for the vehicle.\nAdditional traffic stops and citations, which led to a large debt, a suspended driver\u2019s\nlicense and arrests for failure to appear, did not stop her from driving her vehicle for\nmany years. She finally decided to stop driving a car, as she does not want to go to jail\nagain and does not want to incur more debt. This decision is praiseworthy and should\nhave been made many years earlier. \nApplicant is working hard to improve her fiances and her life. She is making\nprogress towards these goals. However, the record as it now stands is insufficient to\neliminate all concerns about her past debts and past conduct.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from her finances and\npersonal conduct.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.hh:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.ii:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.ii-1.ll:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.mm:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.nn:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.r:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.s:\nFor Applicant\n\n13\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust\nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.\n                                              \n                                                             \nMARY E.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nadjudicative guidelines (AG), implemented in September 2006. \nApplicant timely answered the SOR and requested a hearing. DOHA assigned\nthe case to me on November 18, 2011. A notice of hearing was issued on December\n19, 2011, and the case was heard on January 24, 2012. Department Counsel offered 12\nexhibits, (GE) 1 -12, which were admitted upon stipulation. The Government also\npresented an expert witness. Applicant testified and presented the testimony of four\nwitnesses, including an expert witness. He submitted five exhibits (AE) A-E at the\nhearing, which were admitted upon stipulation. DOHA received the hearing transcript on\nFebruary 1, 2012. Based on a review of the pleadings, submissions, and exhibits, I find\n02/23/2012\n\n2\nApplicant has met his burden of proof on mitigation regarding the security concerns\nraised. Security clearance is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b,\n1.d, and 1.e with explanation. He denied SOR allegation \u00b6 1.c. Applicant is 42 years old.\nHe is married. He received his undergraduate degree in 1991, and his first graduate\ndegree in 1996. Applicant obtained a Master of International Policy and Practice in\n2002. He has held a top secret security clearance since 2004. Applicant has been\nemployed with his current employer since July 2007. (GE 2)\nApplicant\u2019s professional career has included employment with various firms and\ngovernment contracting organizations. He began his career as a computer programmer.\nHe received promotions and increasing responsibilities. His current responsibilities\ninclude supervision of several employees. (Tr. 75)    \nIn 1995, Applicant experienced unusual anxiety and nervousness. According to\nApplicant, he was working as a computer programmer and began to believe that he was\nbeing monitored in the workplace. (AE E) He became depressed and worried about\nthings in the workplace. He believed he was being monitored in some way and that\nperhaps the radio was sending messages that referred to him. His work performance\nwas affected by his anxiety. After talking to his father and seeing a therapist, he\nvoluntarily admitted himself to a hospital. (Tr. 85) Applicant received treatment in the\nhospital for almost two weeks.  He was diagnosed with a delusional disorder,\ndepression, and anxiety. Applicant followed the mental-health recommendation to\nreceive outpatient treatment. He was compliant with his treatment and any prescribed\nmedication. He returned to his employer and earned a bonus for a successful project.\n(Tr. 87) He eventually left to join another company, which would allow him to use his\nmaster\u2019s degree in business. \nFrom 1996, until 2001, Applicant received outpatient treatment from a\npsychiatrist (Dr. R) for his delusional disorder. He was treated with anti-psychotic\nmedications. His psychiatrist noted that from time to time Applicant had exacerbation of\nsymptoms, which necessitated adjustments in the medication regime. Applicant\u2019s\npsychiatrist noted that Applicant\u2019s condition \u201chas the potential to possibly impair his\njudgment and reliability, especially during exacerbation of his condition or symptoms.\u201d\nThis psychiatrist has not seen Applicant since August 2001. (GE 4) Since January 2002,\nApplicant has received treatment from Dr. A, a licensed psychiatrist. (GE 8) Dr. A\u2019s\nmedical opinion, in a January 11, 2010 letter, states that Applicant\u2019s mental health\ncondition has been readily controlled by his medications and he shows consistent\ncompliance with his treatment plan. (GE 8) He further states that Applicant\u2019s depression\nand anxiety is currently in remission and he has no thought or perceptual disorder.\nThere have been no exacerbations in the past two years. The prognosis is good. Dr. A\nconcludes that Applicant has no conditions that may impair his judgment, reliability, or\ntrustworthiness. (GE 8)\n\n3\nWhen Applicant completed his first security clearance application in 1995 and\nagain in June 2003, he disclosed his history of medical treatment for depression and\nother mental-health issues. He noted the name and address of his therapist. (GE1)\nApplicant received his top secret security clearance after the disclosure of his diagnosis\nand mental health issues. Applicant has not had any security violations. \nIn 2003, Applicant worked for a government contractor. During that time, he was\npromoted to the highest professional level within six months. He states that he believed\nhe experienced a hostile work environment from employees who called him gay. He\nvoiced his concerns to his employer. (Tr. 95) Applicant and his employer met to discuss\nthe issues. Applicant also mentioned \u201ccomputer monitoring.\u201d (Tr. 95) Applicant stated\nthat a peer approached him and told him he was being monitored. (Tr. 96) Applicant told\nhis security officer that the verbal exchange with his work peer alarmed him. Sometime\nin 2004, Applicant through counsel, filed three discrimination complaints against his\nemployer. Before the filing, Applicant received good evaluations and promotions and\nbonuses. In 2005, Applicant received a letter from his employer answering concerns\nabout computer monitoring. The letter states that Applicant is subject to the same\nmonitoring as other employees. It also notes that Applicant\u2019s performance reviews have\nbeen very positive. However, in March 2006, an incident report was written, which\nApplicant believes is inaccurate, and also that he had no knowledge. (GE 5) Applicant\nbelieves after the filing of the claims, he received retaliatory treatment from his\nemployer. (Tr.103) He received a poor performance evaluation. He  eventually left the\ncompany. (AE B) He discussed these issues with his therapist who helped him work\nthrough the issues. (Tr. 128)\nApplicant joined another company in August 2006. In January 2007, Applicant\nwas fired from his employment. Applicant was doing a good job, as noted by the owner,\nbut needed to work on \u201ccommunication.\u201d Approximately one week later, he was told that\nhe would not be needed. Applicant was not certain why he was fired. He had raised an\nissue with the employer about possible sexual harassment. Applicant named a few\nindividuals who asked him inappropriate questions. (GE 9) \nExpert Witness Psychiatric Testimony\nOn October 23, 2010, a government psychologist, Dr. M,  interviewed Applicant\nfor approximately one hour. He did not dispute Applicant\u2019s earlier stated diagnosis. He\nnoted in his report that Applicant displayed partial insight into his symptom history\nrelated to the diagnoses.  Dr. M. also noted that Applicant\u2019s anxiety is well managed at\nthis time. Dr. M. elaborated in the report that \u201cwith regard to his delusional thinking, he\nwas cognizant that he has had problems related to his past beliefs that he was\n\u201cmonitored.\u201d  The psychologist noted that Applicant showed progress with regard to the\ninfluence that such concerns have on his life. Applicant told Dr. M that he was better\nable to \u201clet go\u201d of his concerns and worries. Applicant noted the antidepressants and\nanti-psychotic medications that he takes. Applicant is committed to taking the prescribed\nmedications. The report stated that Applicant has been fully adherent to his psychiatric\ntreatment since his hospitalization in 2005 according to his report and available records.\n\n4\nDr. M\u2019s report noted that Applicant described progress and strength in his life in\nrecent years that help him remain focused. He is recently married and has great social\nand family support in his life. He is physically active and uses humor as a coping skill.\nHe expresses confidence in his work-related activities. Dr. M noted that symptoms\nrelated to the delusional disorder may return at times in Applicant\u2019s life. He countered\nthat given Applicant\u2019s progress in recent years, the prognosis across the diagnosed\ndisorders appears to be good at this time. (GE 11 )\n At the hearing, Dr. M testified that he performed a mental status evaluation but\ndid not describe the process. He also noted that he reviewed records prepared for the\nSOR. He stated that the delusional disorder is a paranoid concern of a non-bizarre\nnature. (Tr. 21) Dr. M learned from the interview with Applicant that the mental health\nissues have been present in varying degrees throughout at least 15 or 16 years of\nApplicant\u2019s life. (Tr. 22) From the conversation with Applicant, Dr. M believes that\nApplicant has had a difficult time discerning what is really going on and what\u2019s not, \u2013 to\nthe point of driving himself to an acute state in the mid 90s and the mid-2000s. Dr. M\ntestified that depression has not been the major issue with Applicant lately, and that \u201che\nwas actually doing quite well mood wise at the time.\u201d Concerning these diagnosed\nconditions, Applicant\u2019s judgment and ability to exercise judgment \u2013 symptoms may\nfluctuate in his life. (Tr. 24) On cross-examination, Dr. M reiterated that Applicant\u2019s\nprognosis is good and that he is doing \u201creally well.\u201d (Tr. 31)  \nApplicant\u2019s treating psychiatrist for more than eight years, Dr. A. submitted\ndocumentation that stated Applicant is in full remission. (AE C) She has treated\nApplicant since 2002. She notes that Applicant\u2019s disorders were never severe and he\nwas able to function well. She points to completion of his graduate degree and his\nemployment. She notes that Applicant never posed a danger to himself or others. In the\ntime that she has known him, he has not shown any violent tendencies and generally\nhas managed his condition very well. \nIn a December 8, 2011, report, Dr. A states that Applicant has shown\n\u201cremarkable improvement in his mental and emotional health in the last few years.\u201d His\nmajor depression, anxiety disorder, an delusional disorder are in full sustained\nremission. His medications have been reduced in the last two years. Applicant is\ncompliant with his treatment plan. He attends pharmacological evaluation sessions with\nDr. A on a consistent basis. Dr. A points to Applicant\u2019s recent marriage as a very close,\nloving and supportive relationship, which also contributes positively to his stable mental\nhealth. (AE C) As to prognosis, Dr. A states that Applicant\u2019s prognosis is excellent. She\nis not aware of any defect in his judgement, reliability, or trustworthiness related to\ndepression or anxiety. Applicant does not exhibit any aggressive, antisocial, or\nemotionally unstable behavior. She believes there is compelling evidence from his\nemployer that he is an individual who is functioning at a high level of mental and\nemotional fitness. \nDr. C, Applicant\u2019s expert witness, interviewed Applicant in November and\nDecember 2011. He reviewed Applicant\u2019s medical history, the DOHA documents, the\nGovernment\u2019s 2010 psychological report, and reports from Applicant\u2019s treating\n\n5\npsychiatrist from 2002. (AE E) At the hearing, Dr. C. , a seasoned psychiatrist, testified\nthat Applicant is in very good mental health, and is functioning exceptionally well at his\nwork. (Tr. 57) He also noted that Applicant has recently married and is happy in his\nmarriage. His medical opinion is that Applicant has been treated and is in complete\nremission. He agreed with the previously stated mental diagnoses by Applicant\u2019s\ntreating psychiatrist and the government expert witness. (Tr. 59) Dr. C emphasized that\nthere are problems inherent with labels. He referred to mild, moderate, or severe\nconditions. He affirmed that Applicant has been receiving psychiatric treatment for\nalmost ten years and his condition is in remission and his function level is good at work,\nat home, and otherwise. (Tr. 60) Dr. C testified that Applicant\u2019s prognosis is good. He\nstated that the illness has been in complete remission for almost nine years, His mental\nstatus is good. (Tr. 60)\nWhen Dr. C interviewed Applicant in November and December 2011, he stated\nthat Applicant presented as a pleasant and very polite chap. \u201cHe spoke logically and [I]\nfound him to be very candid and direct.\u201d He did note that Applicant always answered\nquestions with a great deal of detail, maybe more than needed, but referred to his\norganized and systematic profile. Dr. C also found Applicant sincere. He acknowledged\nthat Applicant does not show a great deal of range of emotion. Applicant acknowledged\nthat as well. \nConcerning Applicant\u2019s insight into his past delusional and paranoid symptoms,\nDr. C stated Applicant has \u201cat least partial insight\u201d into his past behavior. He cited to the\nfact that Applicant recognized his anxieties in the mid-90s and he voluntarily sought\nhelp. Dr. C referred to Applicant\u2019s treating physician, Dr. A, who notes that Applicant\nhas pursued all treatment measures with her since 2002. Applicant takes medication,\nand has had therapy sessions. Dr. C again referred to Applicant\u2019s marriage as an\nenhancement in Applicant\u2019s life and a stabilizer. As to an ability to safeguard the\nnation\u2019s secrets or classified information, Dr. C does not believe it is a great risk.  He\nnoted that Applicant\u2019s disorder was in the moderate range of delusion in the mid-90s.\nHe emphasized Applicant\u2019s long history of handling classified information and his\nappropriate behavior. Dr. C also praised Applicant for his cooperation and believes if\nApplicant became increasingly anxious or suspicious, he would have the tools to reach\nout to his physician. (Tr. 63)\nApplicant testified that he has always performed well academically. In college, he\nreceived an award for outstanding contribution in leadership to the school and the\ncommunity. (Tr. 76) He was also involved in sports, youth groups, and boy scouts. He\ndescribes his family as loving and supportive. He acknowledges that he has always\nbeen \u201con the quiet side.\u201d He  describes his current mental health as good. He is dealing\nwith the stress attached to the security clearance investigation. He emphasized that he\nhas never received a reprimand during his professional career. He also was clear that\nhe never felt he was a threat to himself or to others. (Tr. 116) in sum, Applicant enjoys\nhis work, his colleagues, and his clients. He sees his treating psychiatrist on a quarterly\nbasis. However, if he felt the need, he would go sooner. (Tr. 91)\n\n6\nApplicant\u2019s wife testified that she met Applicant in 2004 while playing on a\nrecreational volleyball team. She knew about his 1995 psychiatric hospitalization before\ntheir marriage. She describes his demeanor as quiet, shy, and kind. He is logical,\npatient, reliable, and enjoys sports. They entertain friends. Applicant has an excellent\nrelationship with his in-laws. (Tr. 142) Applicant and his wife have attended work social\nfunctions and she reports that he seems well liked and respected. They have been\ninvited to a coworker\u2019s party in the near future.  \nApplicant\u2019s employer testified that Applicant has worked for him approximately\nfour and a half years. Applicant is a valued analyst working on several projects for\nclients in the military. On one project, Applicant is the lead on a major program. (Tr.\n152) He has daily contact with Applicant. He describes Applicant as a trustworthy\nindividual who exercises good judgment. He is reliable. Applicant\u2019s manager has\nobserved him under pressure. He describes Applicant as very steady, very rock solid.\nHe also communicates well in the business setting. (Tr. 154) Applicant is respected at\nwork for his attention to detail and his rigor.  Applicant\u2019s job performance is excellent.\nHe has never received any disciplinary actions. He is aware of the specific issue\nconcerning Applicant\u2019s mental health, dating back to 1995. He recommends Applicant\nfor retention of his security clearance. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions. These guidelines are not inflexible\nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, they are applied\nin conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. An administrative\njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d An administrative judge must consider all\navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe U.S. Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts\nalleged in the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other\nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven\n\n      1 See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd.

Jan. 27, 1995).\n      4 See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive\ninformation), and EO 10865 \u00a7 7.\n      5 ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n      6 Id.\n7\nby Department Counsel. . . .\u201d1 The burden of proof is something less than a\npreponderance of evidence.2 The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.3 \nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect classified information. Such\ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather\nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d4 \u201cThe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d5 Any reasonable doubt\nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be\nresolved in favor of protecting such information.6 The decision to deny an individual a\nsecurity clearance does not necessarily reflect badly on an applicant\u2019s character. It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nand the Secretary of Defense established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions\nAG \u00b6 27 expresses the security concern pertaining to psychological conditions:\nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair\njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is\nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified\nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist)\nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government,\nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating information under this guideline. No negative inference\n\n8\nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the\nbasis of seeking mental health counseling.\nAG \u00b6 28 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, reliability, or\ntrustworthiness that is not covered under any other guideline, including but\nnot limited to emotionally unstable, irresponsible, dysfunctional, violent,\nparanoid, or bizarre behavior;\n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the\nindividual has a condition not covered under any other guideline that may\nimpair judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness; and \n(c) the individual has failed to follow treatment advice related to a\ndiagnosed emotional, mental, or personality condition, e.g., failure to take\nprescribed medication.\nApplicant has a diagnosis of delusional disorder, depression, and anxiety\ndisorder. In 1995, he volunteered to receive hospital observation and treatment for the\nanxiety. He believed he was being monitored in the workplace. He has received\npsychiatric treatment from that time until the present. AG \u00b6 \u00b6 28(a) and (b) apply.\nAG \u00b6 29 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the\nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the\ntreatment plan;\n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment\nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is\ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a\nduly qualified mental health professional;\n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed\nby, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government that an\nindividual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a\nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation;\n(d) the past emotional instability was a temporary condition (e.g., one\ncaused by death, illness, or marital breakup), the situation has been\nresolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of emotional\ninstability; and\n(e) there is no indication of a current problem.\n\n9\nApplicant has received continuous mental-health treatment since 1996. He has\nbeen compliant with all treatment procedures and medication. In recent reports,\nApplicant is described as \u201cin full remission.\u201d His medication has been reduced and he\nhas been in a stable condition. He sees his treating psychiatrist on a quarterly basis.\nApplicant is functioning well at home and in the workplace. He has a supportive and\nloving wife. He has a great social and family support. His treating psychiatrist notes that\nhe is currently showing adaptive behavior and his mood and anxiety symptoms have\nimproved. He does not have any suicidal or homicidal thoughts. He is currently able to\nrecognize that his delusions were not based in reality. His prognosis across the three\ndisorders appears to be good at this time. Applicant has received excellent reviews and\nrecommendations from his current employer. AG \u00b6 28 (a), (b), (c), and (e) apply. I find\nthat he has mitigated the security concerns under the guideline.  \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. As noted above, the\nultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant seeking a security clearance. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case as well as the whole-person factors.\nApplicant is 42 years old. He obtained his undergraduate degree, two graduate\ndegrees, and has worked in a professional capacity since 1995. He is praised by his\ncurrent employer. He has worked successfully in handling classified information. He has\nheld a security clearance since 2004. Applicant married in 2010 and is in a loving,\nsupportive marriage.\nApplicant volunteered for hospital observation and treatment in 1995 after\nexperiencing unusual anxiety and delusions. He has a diagnosis, which he does not\ndispute. He has received treatment since 1996. He has been compliant with his\ntreatment plan and medications. While it is true that Applicant filed three complaints\nagainst one employer alleging sexual harassment and a hostile work environment, the\n\n10\nfact that he did so does not question his current mental health. The events in the 2000s\nare noted, but Applicant has refuted them.\n \nApplicant\u2019s treating physician and his expert witness, Dr. C, concur that\nApplicant\u2019s disorders are in remission. They also concur that the prognosis is good.\nEven the government psychologist, Dr. M. Concurred that Applicant has a good\nprognosis. \nApplicant has  met his burden in this case. Clearance is granted.\n \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline I:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance is granted.\n                                                     \nNOREEN A.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits SOR allegations 1.a \u2013 1.e, and denies SOR allegations 1.f and 1.g because he did not recognize the debts. Applicant is a 38-year-old truck driver employed by a Department of Defense contractor who is applying for a security clearance. He has worked for his current employer since July 2007. This is his first time applying for a security clearance. He is a high school graduate. He is married and has one son, age 11. (Tr at 4-5, 23, 35-36; Gov 1.) Applicant\u2019s security clearance background investigation revealed that he had the following delinquent accounts: a $23,503 debt as a result of a voluntary repossession of a leased 18-wheel semi-truck in 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Gov 4 at 1; Gov 5 at 5); a $2,633 credit card account placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Gov 4 at 1, 2; Gov 5 at 3, 6); a $1,130 credit card account placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Gov 4 at 1; Gov 5 at 5); a $1,747 computer account placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Gov 4 at 2; Gov 5 at 3); a $773 cell phone account placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.e: Gov 4 at 2; Gov 5 at 6); a $128 medical account placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.f: Gov 5 at 4); and a $199 medical account placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.g: Gov 5 at 4). During 2000 \u2013 2004, Applicant owned his own business. In August 2000, he entered into a lease-to-purchase agreement for a semi-truck in the amount of $94,000. He used the truck for his business.

Michael Lyles, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing  \n(e-QIP) on April 17, 2008. On April 30, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn June 1, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on July 15, 2009. \nThe case was assigned to me on July 24, 2009. On August 3, 2009, a Notice of Hearing \nwas issued, scheduling the hearing for August 25, 2009. The case was heard on that \ndate. The Government offered five exhibits which were admitted as Government \nExhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 5. The Applicant testified and offered six exhibits which were marked \nas Applicant Exhibits (AE) A - E. The record was held open until September 8, 2009, to \nSeptember 22, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nallow Applicant to submit additional documents. No additional documents were \nsubmitted. The transcript was received on September 10, 2009.  Based upon a review \nof the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits SOR allegations 1.a \u2013 1.e, and \ndenies SOR allegations 1.f and 1.g because he did not recognize the debts.   \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old truck driver employed by a Department of Defense \ncontractor who is applying for a security clearance. He has worked for his current \nemployer since July 2007. This is his first time applying for a security clearance. He is a \nhigh school graduate. He is married and has one son, age 11. (Tr at 4-5, 23, 35-36; Gov \n1.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance background investigation revealed that he had the \nfollowing delinquent accounts: a $23,503 debt as a result of a voluntary repossession of \na leased 18-wheel semi-truck in 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Gov 4 at 1; Gov 5 at 5); a $2,633 \ncredit card account placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Gov 4 at 1, 2; Gov 5 at 3, 6); a \n$1,130 credit card account placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Gov 4 at 1; Gov 5 at 5); a \n$1,747 computer account placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Gov 4 at 2; Gov 5 at 3); a \n$773 cell phone account placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.e: Gov 4 at 2; Gov 5 at 6); a \n$128 medical account placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.f: Gov 5 at 4); and a $199 medical \naccount placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.g: Gov 5 at 4). \n \nDuring 2000 \u2013 2004, Applicant owned his own business. In August 2000, he \nentered into a lease-to-purchase agreement for a semi-truck in the amount of $94,000. \nHe used the truck for his business. In 2003, business was slow and he started to have \ndifficulty making several payments, including his truck payments. He leased the truck to \nanother company in order to earn more money. The company never paid Applicant for \nhis services. Applicant claims the company owed him approximately $20,000. He took \nthe company to court. The court awarded an $11,500 judgment to Applicant. Although \nattempts have been made, he has been unable to collect the money from the judgment. \n(Tr at 27-32; Answer to SOR.) The lack of payment from this company created an \nadditional financial burden on Applicant. \n \nApplicant contacted the finance department of the company with whom he had \nthe lease-to-purchase agreement when he started to have difficulty making payments. \nThe finance department suggested that he turn the semi-truck back in because he owed \nless than the blue book value of the truck. Applicant owed $38,000. The semi-truck had \nlow mileage, was in good condition, and was valued at $40,000 - $45,000.  After \nApplicant voluntarily surrendered the truck, the truck sold at auction for approximately \n$12,000. He has not paid the $23,503 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) because he disputes the amount of \nthe debt. He believes he was misled by the company finance department to turn in the \nsemi-truck. He believes they did not sell the semi-truck for the amount that it was worth. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nHe hired an attorney pertaining to this debt. His attorney advised him not to contact the \ncompany\u2019s finance department because the five-year statute of limitations runs in \nDecember 2009. (Tr at 29-32; Gov 2 at 5; Answer to SOR) A credit report dated \nNovember 19, 2008, indicates Applicant formally disputed the debt with the credit \nreporting agency. (Gov 4 at 1)   \n \nWhen Applicant owned his own business, he was on the road a large majority of \nthe month. His wife was responsible for paying the bills. He discovered that she is not \ngood at handling the family finances as indicated by some of the delinquent accounts. \nHe took over the responsibility of paying the monthly bills and began to resolve the \ndelinquent accounts. (Tr at 34)  \n \n Aside from the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a which is discussed above, the status \nof the remaining delinquent debts alleged in the SOR are as follows: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b, $2,633 credit card account placed for collection: Account settled on \nApril 30, 2009.  (Tr at 19, 25-26; AE C) This allegation is found in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c, $1,130 credit account placed for collection: Applicant contends this is \nthe same debt as the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b.  The most recent credit report, dated \nNovember 19, 2008, lists a zero balance. (Tr at 25-26, 28; Gov 4 at 1) This allegation is \nfound in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d, $1,747 computer account placed for collection: Account paid on \nFebruary 19, 2009. (Tr at 18-19; AE B) This allegation is found in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e, $773 cell phone account placed for collection: Account paid on May \n12, 2009. (Tr at 22; AE F) This allegation is found in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g, medical bills in the amount of $128 and $199: Accounts \nwere paid on August 24, 2009.  When Applicant contacted the company he discovered \ntwo additional medical bills. All medical bills were resolved. (Tr at 21; AE E) These \nallegations are found in Applicant\u2019s favor.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s net monthly income is $2,400. His wife\u2019s net monthly income is \n$1,100. He estimates that he and his wife\u2019s monthly expenses are $2,400. They have \napproximately $1,100 left over each month after expenses. (Tr at 23-24) Applicant is not \naware of any additional delinquent accounts. He has no open credit card accounts. He \nhas two loans with a credit union, a car loan and a signature loan. The total balance for \nboth loans is $3,000. He is current on federal and state taxes. (Tr at 33-34) \n \nA loan officer from the credit union where Applicant does business wrote a letter \non his behalf. She indicates Applicant has been a customer since August 1992. He has \ntaken out several signature loans and automobile loans over that period of time. He \nmakes his payments on time and is a very honorable person. (AE A)  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant states that he learned a hard lesson when he was running his own \nbusiness. He has worked for a reputable company during the past two years. He \ntestified that no amount of money would make him do anything against the United \nStates.  (Tr at 36, 41-42) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n\n \n5 \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant had financial difficulties in \n2003 due to a business downturn and the default of a significant bill by a business \nassociate. The SOR alleged seven delinquent accounts, an approximate total balance \nof $30,113. Of that amount, $23,503 relates to the voluntary repossession of a semi-\ntruck.  \n \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. September 22, 2005))  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies. Applicant \nstruggled financially in 2003 to 2004 when he was operating his own business. He was \nunaware that some of the accounts became delinquent when his wife was handling the \nfinances. He took over handling the family finances and has resolved all of the \ndelinquent accounts with the exception of the truck repossession. Based on the record \nevidence, Applicant may have a valid dispute with regard to this debt. This outstanding \ndebt does not raise doubts about his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.    \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies. Applicant\u2019s financial problems were \ncaused by a business downturn in 2003. A business associate defaulted on a significant \nbill owed to Applicant\u2019s company. He obtained a judgment against the company but \nefforts to collect on the debt have been unsuccessful. Circumstances beyond his control \ncreated his financial problems. Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nUpon gaining employment with a reputable company, he resolved all of his delinquent \naccounts with the exception of the debt dealing with the truck repossession. He \nconsulted an attorney regarding this debt and disputes the amount of the debt.  Under \nthe circumstances, Applicant acted responsibly towards his financial situation.  \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) applies. Applicant has not received financial counseling but there are clear \nindications that his financial problems are under control. He paid six of the seven \ndelinquent accounts.  \n \nFC MC & 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies. Applicant resolved six of the seven \ndelinquent accounts. He has taken reasonable steps with regard to the remaining debt \nwhich is his largest debt. While that debt remains unresolved, he formally disputed the \ndebt on his credit report and has consulted an attorney regarding the debt. Overall, he \nhas made a good-faith effort to resolve his delinquent accounts.  \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of \nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the \nissue) applies with respect to the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a which involves the voluntary \ntruck repossession. Applicant disputes the amount of the debt. He consulted an attorney \nregarding the debt and is following the advice of his attorney. He also formally disputed \nthe debt on his credit report. FC MC \u00b6 20(e) applies with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.a.  \n \nApplicant has mitigated the concerns raised under Guideline F.  \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n7 \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n        \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered that a business \ndownturn in 2003-2004 resulted in Applicant being unable to pay all of his bills. I \nconsidered that Applicant resolved six of the seven debts. His largest debt remains. \nWith regards to this debt, I considered that Applicant was unable to pay his truck \npayments because a business associate defaulted on a significant bill, resulting in his \nvoluntary return of the truck. He responsibly sought a judgment against his business \nassociate but has not been successful in obtaining payment on the judgment. \nCircumstances beyond his control contributed to his financial problems. Aside from the \ntruck repossession, he only had $6,610 in delinquent consumer debt indicating \nApplicant does not live extravagantly. He charged what he needed as opposed to \nmaking frivolous purchases. He disputes the amount of the debt owed for the truck \nrepossession. He retained an attorney regarding this debt and is following his attorney\u2019s \nadvice. Based on the all of the information in the record, Applicant has proven that he is \nnot a security risk. He mitigated the concerns raised under financial considerations.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interests to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated Financial Considerations concerns but has not mitigated \nPersonal Conduct security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn June 3, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines \nF and E, Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nFebruary 18, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 29, 2009, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to another administrative judge on \nSeptember 28, 2009, and reassigned to me on September 30, 2009. DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on November 9, 2009, and the hearing was convened as scheduled \non December 9, 2009. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7. GE 1, 2, and \n4 through 7 were received without objection. GE 3 was admitted for a limited purpose \nover Applicant\u2019s objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and called one witness. \nHe did not submit any documentary evidence. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on December 23, 2009.  \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nOn my own motion, I amended the SOR by adding an allegation under Guideline \nE, as follows: \n \n2.c. You intentionally provided false testimony at your hearing on \nDecember 9, 2009, when you testified that your wife has not worked since \n1999. \n \nDepartment Counsel did not object to the amendment. Applicant\u2019s objection was \noverruled. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is seeking to \nretain his security clearance. He has worked for his current employer since 1997. He is \na high school graduate. He is married with two children, ages 20 and 17.1  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 12 delinquent debts, with balances totaling in excess of \n$79,000. Applicant denied all the debts alleged in the SOR, with explanations. All of the \ndebts are listed on one or both of the credit reports obtained in April 2008 and January \n2009, with the exception of the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1,c, and 1.l. Those debts \nare not listed on any credit report in evidence. Those allegations were apparently based \nupon Applicant\u2019s response to interrogatories. The $10,115 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b is \nlisted on Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy petition, as discussed below. The $6,919 debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.c is to the same credit card company as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. It is not \nspecifically listed on Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy petition. The $209 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l \nis to the same bank as the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k, which has a $6,608 balance.2   \n \n \nApplicant and his wife filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in May 2009. Schedule F listed \n25 unsecured debts, with claims totaling $108,325. There were 15 medical claims \ntotaling $37,451, including one claim for $25,905. The remaining unsecured debts were \nto banks, credit cards, and collection companies for revolving credit purchases. The \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 36-37, 42; GE 1. \n \n2 Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-4, 7. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nonly secured claim was the $45,600 mortgage on Applicant\u2019s home. The petition listed \nfour vehicles, two were 1998 models, one was a 2001 model, and one was a 2002 \nmodel. All the vehicles are high mileage and are owned outright. The 2001 vehicle had \n250,000 miles, and the 2002 vehicle had 183,000 miles. The petition also listed a 2003 \nall-terrain vehicle (ATV), four horses, eight dogs, and four cats. The ATV was valued at \n$1,500, and the animals were also valued at $1,500. Applicant\u2019s debts were discharged \non August 31, 2009.3  \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his wife\u2019s back injury in 1999. \nExcept for about a 15-month period in 2007 to 2009, she has been out of work since the \ninjury. She had six back operations and multiple medical procedures, resulting in large \nmedical bills. She handled the family finances. She used credit cards to pay her medical \nbills, but was unable to pay everything. She is receiving Social Security disability. She \nworked on a ranch from about November 2007 to February 2009. She worked nights \nwatching the horses. She would drive around the ranch, check on the horses, and water \nand feed them. She worked full-time for about six months, and part-time for the \nremaining nine months.4 She testified: \n \nI got us caught up on bills mainly to pay a lot of those bills off like my car \nand different ones that were actually bills, that, you know, they could take - \n- they could take whatever we had away from us, not exactly get caught \nup on the credit card bills but to get caught up on the other bills.5 \n \n \nApplicant received financial counseling in conjunction with his bankruptcy. His \nwife stated that she is capable of returning to work if it becomes necessary. She stated \nthat she does not require additional surgery. Both of their children have moved out of \nthe home, which has eliminated some expenses. She still handles the family finances, \nbut Applicant keeps himself informed of the status of their finances.6 \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) on \nApril 1, 2008. He answered \u201cNo\u201d Questions 28a and 28b, which asked \u201cIn the last 7 \nyears, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d and \u201cAre you currently \nover 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d Applicant denied intentionally falsifying the SF \n86. He stated that he did not know all the facts of his credit history because his wife \nhandled the finances, and she did not tell him they had delinquent debts. His wife \ntestified that he knew that they were struggling, but not to the extent that they were. She \nattempted to fix the problem on her own.7 After considering all the evidence, I find that \n                                                          \n3 Tr. at 25-27; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5, 6. \n \n4 Tr. at 21-25, 52-53, 57, 61; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR. \n \n5 Tr. at 53. \n \n6 Tr. at 37-41, 53-60. \n \n7 Tr. at 21-23, 32-36, 54; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nthere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant intentionally falsified his \nSF 86.  \n \n \nApplicant testified with his wife out of the courtroom, because she might be called \nas a witness. He testified that his wife had not worked since she injured her back in \n1999: \n \nQ: (Department Counsel): Okay, So in \u201999 she was injured. How seriously \nwas she injured? Did she have to miss work? \n \n \nA: Yes, she missed work. \n \n \nQ: How long did she miss work? \n \n \nA: Oh, crud, for - - well, she hadn\u2019t been to work since. \n \n \nQ: She\u2019s never returned to work? \n \n \nA: No, sir. \n \n \nQ: Okay. \n \n \nA: She is permanently disabled. \n \nQ: Okay. Is she - - she\u2019s permanently disabled. Is she collecting social \nsecurity disability? \n \n \nA: Yes, sir, at this time she is.8 \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife returned to the courtroom after he testified. He did not initially call her \nas a witness. After Department Counsel\u2019s closing statement, she interrupted and stated \nthat she did not have a chance to say anything. Applicant then decided to call her as a \nwitness, and I permitted her testimony over Department Counsel\u2019s objection. She \ntestified about working at the ranch. Applicant testified again and denied intentionally \nproviding false testimony. He stated that she was \u201cbaby-sitting horses,\u201d and he did not \nconsider \u201cdriving around looking at horses\u201d to be a job. When asked what he considered \nit, he stated: \u201cA hobby. I don\u2019t like horses, you know.\u201d9 After considering all the \nevidence, I find that Applicant intentionally provided false testimony when he testified \nthat his wife had not worked since 1999. \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n8 Tr. at 24. \n \n9 Tr. at 50-64, 67. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto pay his obligations for a period. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts were discharged in bankruptcy on August 31, 2009. That is too \nrecent to find AG \u00b6 20(a) applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife injured her back in 1999. She had six back surgeries and \nmultiple hospital and doctor visits. She did not work again until 2007, and then she only \nworked full-time for six months and part-time for nine months. These qualify as \nconditions that were outside Applicant\u2019s control. To be fully applicable, AG \u00b6 20(b) also \nrequires that the individual act responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant should \nhave known that his family\u2019s finances were suffering, but he chose to remain ignorant. I \ndo not find that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) is partially \napplicable.  \n \n \nApplicant received financial counseling as part of his bankruptcy. His financial \nproblems have been resolved through bankruptcy. AG \u00b6 20(c) is applicable. His actions \ndo not qualify as a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.10 AG \u00b6 20(d) is not applicable. \n \n \nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.l are not listed on any credit report in \nevidence. The $10,115 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b is listed on Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy \npetition and in his response to interrogatories. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable to that debt. \nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.l appear either to be duplicates of other alleged \ndebts, or they could have been accounts in Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s name only. AG \u00b6 20(e) is \napplicable to those debts. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n10 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood-faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The \nDirective does not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the \nconcept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows \nreasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, \nan applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available \noption (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of Financial Considerations \nMitigating Condition 6.  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \n\n \n8 \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \n \nApplicant submitted inaccurate information on his SF 86, but as discussed \nabove, there is insufficient evidence for a determination that it was intentional. AG \u00b6 \n16(a) is not applicable. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b are concluded for Applicant. \n \n \nApplicant intentionally provided false testimony at his hearing, when he testified \nthat his wife had not worked since 1999. AG \u00b6 16(b) is applicable as a disqualifying \ncondition.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n\n \n9 \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \nApplicant denied providing false testimony at his hearing. His denial was not \ncredible. I find that no mitigating conditions are applicable to his false testimony.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.       \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant has resolved his financial problems through bankruptcy, but he provided false \ntestimony at his hearing. I have serious doubts about his integrity, judgment, and \nhonesty.  \n \n\n \n10 \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated Financial Considerations concerns but has not mitigated \nPersonal Conduct security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a-2.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                                               \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

Applicant requested a hearing.  On November 15, 2010, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Jennifer I. Goldstein denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in her application\nof the mitigating conditions and whether the Judge erred in applying the whole person concept.\nConsistent with the following discussion, we affirm the decision of the Judge.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is an employee of a\nDefense contractor.  He is married.  \nApplicant used marijuana 10-15 times until his graduation from college in 2002.  Applicant\nand his wife used marijuana on two consecutive days on a trip to Amsterdam in 2007.  \nIn 2003 Applicant failed to disclose his drug use on a security clearance application (SCA)\nand in a follow-up interview four months later.

In 2009\nApplicant disclosed his earlier drug use. \nApplicant enjoys a good reputation among friends and colleagues.\nIn the Analysis portion of her decision, the Judge discussed Applicant\u2019s multiple\nfalsifications and found one of his explanations offered at the hearing for one of his falsifications\nnot credible.  The Judge found the falsifications unmitigated although she discussed some mitigating\nconditions.  She noted that his most recent marijuana use was while holding a security clearance.\nNonetheless, she found the marijuana use partly mitigated.\nIn light of Applicant\u2019s numerous false official statements over several years and the Judge\u2019s\nsustainable conclusion that one of Applicant\u2019s statements at the hearing was not credible, the Board\naffirms the adverse conclusions under Guideline E and under the whole-person concept.  Those\nadverse conclusions influence any analysis of Applicant\u2019s drug history.  Therefore, while the Board\nneed not agree with the Judge\u2019s adverse conclusions under Guideline H, we conclude they are not\nerroneous.\nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn April 13, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline \nH, Drug Involvement and E, Personal Conduct. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective for cases after September 1, \n2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 6, 2010, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 10, 2010. DOHA issued \na notice of hearing on August 11, 2010, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on \n\n \n2 \n \nSeptember 16, 2010. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6, which were \nadmitted without objection. It also introduced two statutes for Administrative Notice, \nmarked Appeal Exs. 1 and 2. The Applicant offered Exhibits (AE) A through R, called \nthree witnesses, and testified on his own behalf. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on September 24, 2010.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted SOR allegations 2.a. and 2.b. He denies allegations 1.a., 2.c., \n2.d., and 2.e. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \n \nApplicant is a 29-year-old employee of a defense contractor since 2003. He is \nmarried and has no children. Applicant\u2019s use of illegal substances began during his \nfreshman year of college. A witness testified that Applicant knew it was illegal to use \ndrugs, but tried marijuana on an experimental basis. From 1998 or 1999 through 2002, \nhe estimates that he used marijuana 10-15 times, generally at parties to celebrate the \nend of a semester. In 2002, he graduated from college and in 2003, he began working \nfor his current employer. From 2002 through 2007, Applicant was not around marijuana \nand did not use it. However, in 2007, Applicant and his wife were visiting Amsterdam \nand used marijuana on two consecutive days. Applicant possessed a security clearance \nat that time. Applicant\u2019s wife testified that she pressured applicant into trying it with her, \nas she has never used it before and was curious about marijuana. Applicant did not \nimmediately report his marijuana use to his security office, upon returning to the U.S., \nbecause he thought that since marijuana was legal in Amsterdam, he did not do \nanything wrong. Applicant now vows never to use marijuana again. He signed a \nstatement to that effect, acknowledging that if he uses marijuana again, his clearance \nwill be revoked. Applicant provided the results of a September 2010 urinalysis to show \nhe recently tested negative to controlled substances. (GE 1; GE 2; GE 5; AE F; AE G; \nAE H; AE R; Tr. 37-38, 65-78, 85, 91, 93 95-96, 99-100, 115, 122.) \n \n \nIn Approximately May of 2003, Applicant completed a security clearance \napplication. He failed to disclose any drug use on this application. His pre-employment \ndrug test showed he was negative for controlled substances. In September of 2003, he \nhad a security clearance interview with an investigator. During that interview, he also \ndenied any prior drug use. He wanted to keep his answers consistent. At hearing, \nApplicant indicated that he failed to disclose his marijuana use because he was \u201cafraid if \nI admitted to using illegal drugs I would be denied my clearance and would be no longer \nable to work\u201d for the government contractor. He was granted a security clearance in \n2004. (GE 6; AE E; Tr. 80-82, 104, 118.) \n \n \nOn May 21, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). Applicant testified that he completed the \nquestionnaire quickly. In his answer to Section 24.a. he indicated he had used \nmarijuana two times in September 2007. Applicant failed to indicate his earlier \nmarijuana use, from 1999 to 2002. Applicant indicated at hearing that he unintentionally \nomitted his earlier drug use from the e-QIP. Applicant also indicated \u201cno\u201d to 24.b. which \n\n \n3 \n \nasked if he had \u201cever illegally used a controlled substance while employed as a law \nenforcement officer, prosecutor, or courtroom official; while possessing a security \nclearance; or while in a position directly and immediately affecting public safety?\u201d \nApplicant explained that he \u201cthough that since I did it in a place that it was legal, I kind of \ndidn\u2019t think I did anything wrong.\u201d (GE 1; Tr. 83, 86, 90-91, 112-113, 118 \n \n \nOn August 1, 2008, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator, regarding his \ne-QIP. Applicant discussed his September 2007 marijuana use with the investigator. \nThe Personal Subject Interview was adopted by the Applicant on March 12, 2010, as \naccurately reflecting the interview. It indicated \u201cSubject denies having any other drug-\nrelated incidents or involvement in the past 7 years.\u201d (GE 3; GE 4.) \n \n \nA second security clearance interview was conducted on April 14, 2009. \nApplicant testified that between the two interviews, he reviewed his e-QIP and \ndiscovered he had omitted his 1999-2002 marijuana use. He indicated that he \nimmediately came forward with the details about his prior use at the beginning of this \ninterview. He provided an affidavit that detailed all of his marijuana uses, as set out \nabove. In the affidavit, he stated \u201cI did not list this marijuana use on my application \nbecause I thought I did not have to,\u201d when referring to his omission of his marijuana use \nfrom 1999 to 2002. At hearing, he explained that he only thought that he needed to list \nfive years back from the date of the e-QIP. (GE 2; Tr. 88-89, \n \n \nApplicant is well regarded by friends, colleagues, and supervisors. Among the \nmany recommendations, a friend listed his attributes to include \u201csincerity, honesty, \nthoughtfulness, intelligence, responsibility, caring, and loyalty.\u201d A former manager noted \nthat Applicant was a \u201cconscientious and dedicated worker.\u201d His performance \nevaluations reflect that Applicant met or exceeded expectations from 2004-2009 and \nwas on track to achieve similar ratings for 2010. He has also been the recipient of \nseveral appreciation awards, issued to him by his company. (AE A; AE B; AE C; AE D; \nAE J; AE K; AE L; AE M; AE N; AE O; AE P; AE Q; Tr. 35-49, 50-65.)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n\n \n4 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to Drug Involvement: \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \n \n \nI have considered all of the evidence in this case and the disqualifying conditions \nunder Drug Involvement AG \u00b6 25 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) any drug abuse. \n \n \nThe Government presented sufficient information to support the factual allegation \nunder Guideline H (SOR 1.a.). Applicant began using illegal substances in 1999 and \nlast used marijuana in September 2007. These facts established through the \nGovernment\u2019s information and through Applicant\u2019s admissions raise a security concern \nunder all of the above disqualifying conditions. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nI have considered all of the evidence in this case and the mitigating conditions \nunder Drug Involvement AG \u00b6 26 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate \nperiod of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic \nrevocation of clearance for any violation. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana in 1999 through 2002 was not recent, having \noccurred over eight years ago. However, his 2007 use was more recent. Applicant\u2019s \ndrug use did not occur under unusual circumstances, as he used marijuana at parties, \nwith friends. Moreover, as recently as 2007, the fact that he held a security clearance \ndid not prevent him from engaging in this questionable conduct. While the Government \nfailed to allege marijuana use after being granted a clearance as a separate allegation \nunder Guideline H, such use casts doubts about Applicant\u2019s judgment. Mitigation under \nAG \u00b6 26(a) applies in part, only in regard to his early marijuana use.  \n \nAs to AG \u00b6 26(b) (4), Applicant testified that he will not use marijuana in the \nfuture, and submitted a statement to that effect. However, Applicant's failure to disclose \nhis 1999 through 2002 marijuana use on his first application, in his 2003 interview, and \non his 2008 e-QIP, undermines the reliability of this statement. Further, Applicant has \nan ongoing relationship with his wife, with whom he used marijuana in September 2007. \nOnly partial mitigation is available under AG \u00b6 26(b) (1).  \n \nAs of the date of the hearing, Applicant had not used marijuana in three years. \nThere is no bright line defining an appropriate period of reform and rehabilitation. In \nsome cases, three years could be interpreted as a sufficient period of abstinence. \nHowever, the fact that Applicant knowingly used an illegal drug after he was granted a \nsecurity clearance, and the poor judgment shown by this conduct, weighs against a \nconclusion that sufficient time has passed. The partial mitigation under AG \u00b6 26 does \nnot overcome the gravity of the fact that Applicant chose to use marijuana while he held \na security clearance. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, \nprofessional, or community standing, or (2) while in another country, \nengaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is legal in that \ncountry but illegal in the United States and may serve as a basis for \nexploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence service or \nother group. \n \n \nApplicant admits to the falsification of his 2003 security clearance application \n(unalleged) and his September 2003 interview with an investigator for DoD (allegation \n2.b). The Government also presented sufficient information to establish that Applicant \nfalsified his May 2008 e-QIP, when he answered Sections 24.a. and 24.b. (allegations \n2.c. and 2.d.). His explanation that he thought he only needed to list the past five years \nis not credible, when the text of the question 24.a. is examined. Section 24.a. clearly \nasks for conduct occurring \u201csince the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is \nshorter.\u201d His explanation that he thought since marijuana was legal in Amsterdam that \nhe did not need to disclose his use with a security clearance under 24.b. is arguably \ncredible because of the way the question is phrased. The Government has established \nsufficient concern under AG \u00b6 16(a) to disqualify Applicant from possessing a \nclearance.  \n \n \nFurther, Applicant chose to engage in an activity that he knew was illegal in the \nU.S., while possessing a security clearance. His personal conduct displays questionable \njudgment and creates vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. AG \u00b6 16(e) \nis disqualifying. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \n \nApplicant's falsification is unmitigated. Falsification of information provided to the \nGovernment cannot be considered minor. Although Applicant disclosed his 2007 drug \nuse when he completed his 2008 application, the record contains no evidence that he \nsought to correct the falsification promptly after completing the 2002 application or his \n2003 interview. While he contends that he came forward and admitted his 1999-2002 \ndrug use to the investigator in his April 2009 interview, his disclosure was in no way \nprompt, having the opportunity to make full disclosure in his 2008 interview. Instead of \ncoming forward in August 2008, he chose to blatantly deny any other drug use. His \nconduct reflects negatively on his trustworthiness and good judgment. Further, his \ndecision to use marijuana, a substance that is illegal in the U.S., while vacationing in \nAmsterdam, indicates that Applicant lacks the judgment to possess a clearance. He has \nnot shown sufficient steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n17(a), 17(c), and 17(e) do not apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n8 \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nWeighing in Applicant's favor are several positive factors: he has earned a \ncollege degree, and performed successfully at work, receiving good ratings and several \nawards. He has the trust and support of his supervisor, friends, and co-workers. He \nabstained from marijuana use for three years.  \n \n \nHowever, other facts raise security concerns. Applicant used marijuana up to \nfifteen times between 1999 and 2002. He used marijuana in September 2007, even \nthough he had been granted a security clearance in 2004 and he was aware that drug \nuse was a security concern. Then he chose to hide his drug use from the Government \nfor several years. His conduct indicates a lack of judgment and trustworthiness, and \nraises doubts as to whether he understands what is required of those who hold security \nclearances. \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence fails to satisfy the doubts raised about Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the security concerns arising from the cited adjudicative guidelines. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n  \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINSTAPPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.d.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.e.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n9 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nJennifer I. Goldstein \nAdministrative Judge \n",

In 2003, Applicant purchased a home.  In 2004, Applicant purchased\na second home and moved into it with his wife, intending to pay a new mortgage (for $172,000) on\nthe first home and an unsecured loan (for $43,000) with rent from a tenant and $400 a month of his\nown money.

(The current balance is $19,569.)\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2014\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).\nApplicant objects to some of the Judge\u2019s statements concerning his financial situation.  After\nreviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material findings are based on substantial\nevidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or inferences that could be drawn from the\nrecord.  The statements are therefore sustainable.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-24013 at 2 (App. Bd.\nMar. 4, 2008).\nApplicant also contends that the Judge did not give adequate weight to his evidence of\nmitigation.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether\nthe favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s disagreement\nwith the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

Edmunds, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant is a naturalized United States citizen, whose mother, three of his\nsiblings, and his mother-in-law are resident citizens of his native Nigeria. Foreign\ninfluence concerns raised by these close family ties to Nigeria are mitigated by his\nstrong ties to the U.S., developed since 1980. Financial concerns raised by delinquent\ndebt totaling about $92,500 are not mitigated. Clearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on January 23, 2008. On March 30, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline B and Guideline F that provided the basis for its\npreliminary decision to deny him a security clearance and to refer the matter to an\nadministrative judge. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nNovember 9, 2009\n\nA second copy of the character reference letter admitted as Exhibit B was forwarded by its author\n1\nto DOHA. The parties were notified of my receipt of the document at the hearing, and since it was cumulative\nof Exhibit B, it was placed in the correspondence file.\nThe State Department publications are as follows: Background Note: Nigeria, dated April 2009;\n2\nNigeria, Country Specific Information, dated April 21, 2009; 2008 Human Rights Report: Nigeria, dated\nFebruary 25, 2009; and Travel Warning, Nigeria, dated December 2, 2008. \nCRS Report for Congress, Nigeria: Current Issues, updated January 30, 2008.\n3\nThe U.S. Embassy publications consist of W arden Messages issued jointly by the U.S. Embassy\n4\nAbuja and the U.S. Consulate General Lagos on March 16, 2009, and April 3, 2009.\n2\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense as of September 1, 2006.\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 3, 2009. On April 10, 2009,\nhe answered the SOR and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The\ncase was assigned to me on May 15, 2009, to decide whether it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On May\n21, 2009, the government moved for administrative notice of certain facts pertinent to\nNigeria and its foreign relations, including with the United States, infra. On June 2,\n2009, I scheduled a hearing for July 1, 2009.\nAt the hearing seven government exhibits (Ex. 1-7) and 22 Applicant exhibits (Ex.\nA-V) were admitted without any objections.  Applicant and four witnesses testified, as\n1\nreflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on July 10, 2009.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nOn May 21, 2009, Department Counsel requested administrative notice be taken\nof certain facts relating to the Federal Republic of Nigeria (Nigeria) and its foreign\nrelations, including with the U.S. The request was based on publications from the\nDepartment of State,  the Congressional Research Service,  and the U.S. Embassy in\n2\n3\nNigeria.  The government\u2019s formal request and the attached documents were not\n4\nadmitted into evidence but were included in the record. At the hearing on July 1, 2009,\nApplicant filed no objections to my taking administrative notice of the facts set forth in\nthe government\u2019s motion. Accordingly, I agreed to review the source documents and to\ntake administrative notice of particular facts pertaining to Nigeria in determining\nApplicant\u2019s current security eligibility, as set forth in the Findings of Fact.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline B, foreign influence, that Applicant\u2019s mother\n(SOR 1.a), one brother and two sisters (SOR 1.b), and his mother-in-law (SOR 1.c) are\n\n3\nresident citizens of Nigeria. Under Guideline F, financial considerations, Applicant was\nalleged to owe nine delinquent debts totalling $93,048 (SOR 2.a-2.i). Applicant denied\nthe allegations. After considering the pleadings, exhibit, transcript, and the facts\npertaining to Nigeria for administrative notice, I make the following findings of fact.\nPersonal Background\nApplicant is a 55-year-old senior engineer, who has worked for his current\nemployer, a defense contractor, since November 1997. He seeks to retain a secret-level\nsecurity clearance that was granted to him for his duties in about February 1998 (Ex. 1).\nApplicant was born and raised in Nigeria (Exs. 1, 3). At age 18, he went to work\nfor a U.S. oil company as a machine operator (Ex. 3). After studying in Europe and then\nin Canada, he came to the U.S. on a visitor visa in the spring of 1980. In June 1980,\nwhile working as a machinist in the U.S., he began part-time college study (Ex. 3). The\nfollowing month, he married his first wife, who had emigrated from Nigeria to the U.S. in\n1979 (Ex. 3). Two children were born to them in the U.S., in June 1981 and in\nNovember 1984 (Exs. 1, 3).\nApplicant was awarded an associate\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering in May\n1985, and a bachelor of science in manufacturing and industrial engineering in May\n1986. He remained in the U.S. to pursue his career as an engineer. Starting in August\n1986, he worked over the years for a succession of commercial manufacturing\ncompanies, holding various positions of responsibility for task time and cost analysis,\nproduction processes, and workstation improvements and layouts (Ex. A). While\nemployed as a senior industrial engineer for a mine safety appliance company,\nApplicant began graduate studies in manufacturing engineering in September 1991\n(Exs. 1, 2, A). In about January 1993, he was laid off from his job, and he relied on\nunemployment compensation until March 1994, when he began working as an engineer\nfor a cable corporation. In May 1994, he was awarded his master of science degree\n(Exs. 1, 2, 3, A).\nIn December 1993, Applicant and his first wife divorced. Applicant began a\nrelationship with a Nigerian citizen who was in the U.S. on a tourist visa. They would\neventually marry in May 1997, after they had two children together. A third child was\nborn to them in October 2000 (Exs. 1, 3).\nApplicant lost his job due to a corporate reorganization in May 1997, and he was\nunemployed until he commenced his defense contractor employment in November 1997\n(Ex. 2). Before his start date, he executed a Questionnaire for National Security\nPositions (SF 86) on October 21, 1997, for a secret-level security clearance (Ex. 2). He\nwas issued his clearance in about February 1998 (Ex. 1), having informed the\nDepartment of Defense of family ties to Nigeria and of pleasure travel to Nigeria from\nDecember 1995 to January 1996, which was on a Nigerian passport last renewed in\nDecember 1992 (Ex. 2).\n\n4\nIn addition to maintaining his full-time employment with the defense contractor,\nApplicant was a part-time adjunct instructor in industrial and mechanical engineering,\nand in mathematics, from January 1998 to June 2002 for the university at which he had\nearned his bachelor\u2019s degree. In about October 2003, Applicant assumed the\nresponsibilities of an engineering/planning specialist and task manager for the defense\ncontractor (Exs. A, F). Applicant showed a willingness to take on new challenges on the\njob. He transitioned smoothly into production control duties over the March 2006 to\nMarch 2007 rating period, and was rated as exceeding job requirements (Ex. E). \nIn March 2007, Applicant became a senior engineer responsible for developing\ncost estimates, determining task schedules, and managing program tasks to completion\nfor two classes of submarines. He met his job requirements for the rating periods March\n2007 to February 2008 (Ex. D) and March 2008 through February 2009 (Ex. C). \nIn July 2008, Applicant was accepted into a doctoral program in industrial and\nmanufacturing engineering at the state university (Exs. 3, G). He began his doctorate\nstudies while continuing to work for the defense contractor, although he dropped out of\nthe program after the SOR was issued.\nApplicant has been an advocate for Nigerian and other immigrant communities in\nhis area (Tr. 71). He previously served on the board of a now closed community credit\nunion he co-founded to assist immigrant populations under served by other financial\ninstitutions (Tr. 100). A state senator with a prominent position in his state\u2019s legislature,\nwho had served on the credit union board with him and who witnessed Applicant\u2019s\ninvolvement at community fairs, especially involving health care issues, found Applicant\nto be committed, efficient, and honest (Ex. H, Tr. 71-73). Applicant mentioned to him \u201ca\ncouple months ago\u201d that he had lost a rental property to foreclosure (Tr. 77-78, 82). This\nsenator has no reservations about recommending Applicant for a security clearance (Tr.\n74), given what he knows of Applicant\u2019s involvement in the community and Applicant\u2019s\nfriends.\nAt least 21 of Applicant\u2019s coworkers also endorse continuation of his eligibility for\na secret clearance (Ex. J). A task manager in the program office, who has worked\nclosely with Applicant for several years, is aware that Applicant has some financial\nproblems but he believes \u201c[Applicant] is an honest and trustworthy man with a good\nheart and would never knowingly do anything illegal concerning classified information.\u201d\n(Ex. V). Another coworker of Applicant\u2019s, who has worked closely with him over the past\ntwo and one-half years, has observed Applicant to be very dedicated to his work, as\nsomeone who follows through on tasks in a timely manner (Tr. 60). In April 2009,\nApplicant made him aware generally of some credit issues (Tr. 66). He knows Applicant\nis from Nigeria, and  does not consider Applicant to be a risk to security (Tr. 60-63, 67).\nApplicant has maintained a relationship with a former professor from the early\n1980s. Applicant has sought his advice over the years concerning academic studies,\nand they had discussed forming an industrial engineering consulting firm in the past.\nThis professor found Applicant to be an outstanding student and \u201ca person of the\n\nApplicant told a government investigator that he had a second mortgage on his former residence of\n5\n$27,000 (Ex. 3). His February 2008 credit report lists the debt in SOR 2.b as a charged off line of credit\nopened in January 2006 for $27,447 (SOR 2.b) (Ex. 7). Applicant testified on direct examination that the debt\nin SOR 2.b was a loan for repairs to the rental property (Tr. 98). Yet, on cross examination, he indicated the\ncreditor in SOR 2.b held the second mortgage (Tr. 111). He indicated that the mortgage was for siding for the\nrental property (Tr. 136), and that the loan in SOR 2.h was to change the roof on the house (Tr. 136). Neither\nSOR 2.b or 2.h is listed as a mortgage debt on his credit reports.\nApplicant took out an automobile loan in February 2006 for $36,073. Through timely payments of\n6\n$632 per month (Ex. 3), he had reduced the loan balance to $26, 301 as of January 2008 (Ex. 7).\n5\nhighest integrity.\u201d He understands Applicant has had some credit problems and family in\nNigeria, but he is unaware of the extent of the financial issues or of Applicant\u2019s contacts\nwith his foreign family members (Tr. 38-41).\nA close friend of Applicant\u2019s, who shares his ethnic heritage, met him at school in\nthe U.S. They are members of the same social club. He has known Applicant to be a\nhard worker (Tr. 47-49, 54). In early 2009, Applicant informed him generally that he had\nsome debts and a repayment plan (Tr. 52-53). This friend met Applicant\u2019s mother when\nshe stayed with Applicant in the U.S., which he recalled as \u201ca couple of years ago.\u201d (Tr.\n50-51).\nFinancial\nWith limited exception, Applicant had a history of timely payments on his financial\nobligations before 2006. In November 2003, a medical creditor was awarded a\njudgment of $490 against Applicant (SOR 2.a), which he paid in May 2004 (Ex. 7). In\nJuly 2004, Applicant and his spouse bought a new home, taking on a joint mortgage\ndebt of $313,500 (Ex. 7, Tr. 90). They decided to keep their previous home (a large,\none-family house) as a rental property (Ex. 3, Tr. 92, 94), and in September 2004, they\nrefinanced the mortgage on that house, paying off their old loan of $160,000 with a new\nmortgage of $172,000. They also took out an unsecured loan of $43,000 on the\nproperty (SOR 2.h) (Exs. 3, 7).  Applicant and his spouse, a nurse (Tr. 116-17), counted\n5\non the rental income to cover the loans (Ex. 3), although he also had to contribute about\n$400 of the $2,100 monthly mortgage payment (Tr. 183-84).\nIn 2005, the tenants stopped paying their rent (Ex. 3, Tr. 93), and Applicant\ncovered the mortgage for the rental property as well as his current residence (Tr. 180).\nEfforts to sell the rental property were not successful. Due to a decrease in his wage\nearnings for 2006 ($59,468) from 2005 ($76,329) (Ex. S), and with his spouse willing to\ncontribute only about 10% to 15% to the household expenses (Tr. 116-17), Applicant\ncould not keep up his payments on all their financial obligations. He continued to pay\nthe mortgage on his new home and his car note  on time, but he stopped paying the\n6\nloans taken out for the rental property after June 2006. Foreclosure proceedings were\ninitiated by the mortgagee of the rental property. The foreclosure was redeemed,\nleaving Applicant with no liability for the first mortgage. But as of December 2007, he\n\nAvailable credit reports (Exs. 5, 6, 7, U) do not reflect a delinquent balance on an account with that\n7\ncreditor.\n6\nwas past due $8,104 on a balance of $49,369 on an installment loan (SOR 2.h) taken\nout for a new roof for the premises (Tr. 136) (Ex. 7).\nDespite annual wages of $60,472 in 2007 (Ex. S), a $24,144 line of credit (SOR\n2.b) was $3,734 past due as of October 2007 and in collection. His Discover card\naccount, used to furnish his current home (Tr. 113-14), was placed for collection when it\nbecame 150 days past due. As of January 2008, the balance was $6,190 (SOR 2.c).\nAnother credit card was charged off in the amount of $3,728 and referred for collection\nin August 2007 due to nonpayment since December 2006 (SOR 2.d). An unpaid\nbalance of $355 on a retail charge account was 150 days past due as of August 2007\n(SOR 2.e). Another charge account with a home improvement retailer fell behind $508 \nand was closed as of January 2008 (SOR 2.f). A telephone provider for services at his\nnew home placed a $564 balance for collection (SOR 2.g). A credit card account for\ngasoline was cancelled by the creditor (SOR 2.i) due to nonpayment. As of May 2007,\nhe owed $1,664 on the account (Ex. 7). In January 2008, a home improvement loan\nwas charged off in the amount of $5,494 and placed for collection (not alleged) (Exs. 3,\n7).\nOn January 23, 2008, Applicant completed an e-QIP for a periodic reinvestigation\nof his security clearance. He disclosed the foreclosure of the primary mortgage on his\nrental property, but only one previously delinquent credit card debt of $3,200 that had\nbeen satisfied in 2007 (not alleged) (Ex. 1). Evidence suggests he was aware of at least\nthe debt in SOR 2.b, as he testified that he contacted the lender in February or March\n2008 and expressed his difficulty in making his payments. The lender wanted payments\nof almost $500 per month, which he could not afford (Tr. 111-12).\nOn May 13, 2008, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator, in\npart about his delinquent debts. Applicant attributed his delinquent debt to having to pay\nthe mortgage costs for his present residence as well as the rental property. He\nacknowledged that the rental property had been foreclosed. He had no contact with the\nmortgage lender after the house was sold in February 2008, and \u201choped\u201d that the\nproceeds from the sale had satisfied the loans in 2.b and 2.h. He indicated he would\nwork out a repayment plan for his delinquent home improvement loan (not alleged) with\nthe credit union. Applicant was uncertain whether he had in fact satisfied the credit card\ndebt that he disclosed on his e-QIP.  He disputed the reported delinquencies in SOR\n7\n2.e, 2.f, and 2.g, but acknowledged unpaid debt (balances unknown) to the creditors in\nSOR 2.c and 2.i. He was unable to confirm or deny the debts in SOR 2.a and 2.d.\nApplicant volunteered that he was in arrears about $507 for electricity and about $800\nfor natural gas for his present residence. He was paying only the current monthly\ncharges on both accounts and nothing toward the arrearage. Applicant estimated he\nhad $5,220 in joint net income available for $5,999 in expenses (including $3,443 for\ntheir mortgage) since his spouse was contributing only about $1,720 of her $4,000 net\nsalary to the household. Applicant expressed a desire to obtain credit counseling for\n\nApplicant provided only his initial statement of account activity (Ex. O) showing the $375.37 payment\n8\non July 21, 2008. He annotated his statement to indicate that the amount had been deducted from his account\nsince July 2008. The statement of account from the debt management company indicates he was to pay $385\neach month under the plan. Neither party inquired about the discrepancy at the hearing.\nEquifax reported the $490 medical judgment in SOR  2.a, without indicating whether it had been paid\n9\n(Ex. 5). Other credit reports in the record (Exs. 7, U) clearly indicate it had been paid.\n7\nassistance in working out a budget that would permit him to live within his means (Ex.\n3).\nIn July 2008, Applicant contracted with a debt management company to act as\nhis agent in negotiating settlements with his creditors, and he made an initial payment of\n$375.37 by debit on July 21, 2008 (Ex. O). Applicant was to pay $385 per month for 48\nmonths to resolve debt totalling $48,718.05, which included the debts in SOR 2.b-2.e,\n2.g, and 2.i and the credit union loan that was not alleged (Exs. 3, L, M, O, Tr. 98).8\nApplicant did not include the debt in SOR 2.h in the plan because it had been charged\noff (Tr. 98).\nIn September 2008, Applicant and his spouse refinanced the mortgage on their\nprimary residence, taking out a new loan of $402,447. They paid off his loan with the\ncredit union (not alleged) through the refinancing (Ex. 3, Tr. 91-92), and the debt was\nremoved from the debt repayment plan (Exs. 3, P).\nAs of January 2009, his creditors were reporting the debt balances in SOR 2.b-\n2.i, for a total of $92,558 in delinquent debt.  (Ex. 5). He testified that the creditor in\n9\nSOR 2.b was willing to settle for about $19,000 (Tr. 99), but did not document any\nsettlement offer. As of July 1, 2009, none of his debts had yet been paid by the debt\nresolution firm (Tr. 123). The company had taken its fees upfront from the funds he had\npaid since July 2008. Based on the last statement he received, Applicant understood\nthat his fees had been paid in full and that all future funds would be going to his debts\n(Tr. 118-19). Applicant intends to pay off some of his smaller debts himself and have\nthem removed from the plan when he has the extra money to do so (Tr. 122). He plans\nto add the delinquent loan in SOR 2.h to the plan in the future if necessary (Tr. 141).\nApplicant paid his car loan on time, and the balance was down to $19,569 (Ex.\nU). In April 2009, Applicant participated in three hours of internet and telephone credit\ncounseling with a certified credit counselor (Ex. K, Tr. 151). Around that same time,\nApplicant estimated his net worth to be about $35,238, although his mortgage obligation\nexceeded the market value of his home by about $40,400 (Ex. N, Tr. 143). He was\ncurrent in his mortgage payments (Tr. 143-44).\nAs of the end of December 2008, Applicant\u2019s stock and savings investment\naccount at work had a balance of $65,188.94. Over the next six months, it lost 20.8% of\nits value and the balance was down to $46,477.13 (Ex. R). As of late March 2009,\nApplicant had $12,600 in student loan funds on deposit set aside for his doctoral studies\n(Ex. Q, Tr. 148-49). He had enrolled in the doctoral program but dropped out when he\n\nThe government alleged no foreign preference concerns related to Applicant\u2019s possession of a\n10\nforeign passport or ownership of land in Nigeria. These connections are relevant to assessing the risk of\nforeign influence.

He has no active credit card accounts and relies on his\ndebit card for purchases (Tr. 93).\nForeign Connections\nApplicant was raised with his siblings (three brothers and two sisters) in Nigeria,\nwhere their parents were farmers (Ex. 3). In April 1978, he left Nigeria to study in\nEurope, and then in Canada, eventually coming to the U.S. on a tourist visa in March or\nApril 1980. After more than ten years of U.S. permanent residency, Applicant became a\nnaturalized U.S. citizen in February 1996. He was issued his first U.S. passport in\nMarch 1996 (Exs. 2, 3). His spouse became a naturalized U.S. citizen in February 2005\n(Exs. 1, 3).\nOn his initial application for a security clearance executed on October 21, 1997,\nApplicant indicated that he possessed dual citizenship with Nigeria and the U.S. He\ndisclosed the Nigerian residency and citizenship of his mother, one brother, two sisters,\nand parents-in-law. His father was deceased. His other brother was a dual citizen of the\nU.S. and Nigeria living in the U.S. Applicant also reported that he had a 19-year-old\ncousin with Nigerian citizenship living with him. Applicant also indicated that he had\npossession of a Nigerian passport valid to December 1997, and that he had travelled to\nNigeria for pleasure from December 1995 to January 1996 (Ex. 2).\nOn December 2, 1997, Applicant was interviewed about his foreign ties. He\nexpressed his intent to renew his Nigerian passport, but that travel to Nigeria to see his\nrelatives would be on his U.S. passport. He added that he owned two undeveloped lots\nin his hometown in Nigeria at his mother\u2019s request. Applicant denied ever voting in a\nNigerian election or being employed by the Nigerian government. After more than 10\nyears as a U.S. permanent resident, he acquired U.S. citizenship \u201cafter thinking deeply\ndue to the situation of the Nigerian country\u201d (Ex. 4).  He was granted his security\n10\nclearance.\nOn his January 23, 2008, e-QIP for renewal of his clearance, Applicant denied he\nheld dual citizenship, or that he had held a foreign passport in the last seven years. He\nlisted one trip to Nigeria, for three weeks from December 2003 to January 2004.\nApplicant reported his spouse was solely a citizen of the U.S. since her naturalization in\n2005 (Ex. 1).\nDuring his interview with a government investigator on May 13, 2008, Applicant\nasserted that on receipt of his first U.S. passport, his Nigerian passport was stamped\ncancelled and mailed to the Nigerian Consulate. He expressed a belief that he was no\nlonger a Nigerian citizen based on the cancellation of his foreign passport, and he\n\n9\ndenied any attempt thereafter to renew his Nigerian passport. Concerning his relatives\nin Nigeria, Applicant volunteered that one brother lived with their mother in Nigeria, and\nhe owned a bicycle parts store. His two sisters in Nigeria were married to farmers. None\nof his Nigeria relatives knew that he worked for a defense contractor or that he had a\nclearance. Applicant contacted his mother two times a month and his siblings in Nigeria\nthree times a year. He indicated he sent his mother about $800 per year as needed, but\nprovided no support for his siblings. Another brother immigrated to the U.S. in 1983 and\nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1995. Concerning his in-laws, his mother-in-law\nhad been a food vendor on the streets of Nigeria before she retired, and she was\nreceiving about $600 to $800 annually in monetary support from Applicant\u2019s spouse. His\nfather-in-law, who died in March 2007, had been a magazine printer in Nigeria.\nApplicant volunteered that his spouse was visiting her mother in Nigeria to attend the\nfuneral of a grandparent, and that she intended to stay about three weeks. Applicant\ndenied \u201cany past or present financial obligations, investments, anticipated inheritance,\nor ownership of any property outside the U.S.\u201d He disclosed trips of three weeks in\nduration to visit family in Nigeria, from December 1998 to January 1999, in January\n2001, and December 2003 to January 2004 (Ex. 3).\nApplicant testified that his mother visited him in the U.S. only once, about 18\nyears ago when she stayed for three years (Tr. 159-60). His close friend testified that he\nmet Applicant\u2019s mother, when she was in the U.S. for about a year,  \u201ca couple of years\nago.\u201d (Tr. 51-52). Applicant maintains his friend was incorrect (Tr. 160). Applicant\u2019s trips\nto Nigeria have been to visit his mother. He has not been to Nigeria since the trip in\nDecember 2003 (Tr. 64, 87, 154). Applicant stayed with his mother when he was in\nNigeria in 1998, 2001, and 2003. He denies that he visited with any of his siblings (Tr.\n154-55, 157-58). He took his three sons with him on the trip in 2003 (Tr. 155). As of July\n2009, Applicant was sending his mother between $50 and $75 twice a year (Tr. 161)\nand his brother was contributing the remainder of the $800 she was receiving from her\nsons in the U.S. (Tr. 161). Applicant testified he telephones his mother now about once\na year (Tr. 168), and that he had more frequent contact (once every three months) until\nas recently as a couple of years ago (Tr. 168-69). When confronted with the\ndiscrepancy between these reported contacts and what he told the investigator in May\n2008 (twice monthly contact with his mother), he responded that he changed his \u201cstyle\u201d\non how he contacted his mother because of what he is going through (Tr. 171-72). He\nlast talked to his mother in December 2008 (Tr. 169).\nApplicant\u2019s 52-year-old brother and his two sisters (ages 45 and 42) have\nremained resident citizens of Nigeria. None of his siblings has been employed by the\nNigerian government or served in the Nigerian military (Tr. 87). They have not visited\nhim in the U.S. (Tr. 160). He speaks with his siblings if they happen to be at his\nmother\u2019s home when he calls her (Tr. 168). He denies any contact with his siblings in\nNigeria since February 2008 (Tr. 169). As of July 2009, Applicant was not sending any\nfinancial support to his siblings in Nigeria (Tr. 88, 161). Applicant sold the undeveloped\nreal estate that he had owned in Nigeria almost ten years ago. He does not currently\nown any land in Nigeria (Tr. 145).\n\n10\nAs of July 2009, Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law was a Nigerian resident citizen. She\nhad never worked for the Nigerian government or its military (Tr. 89). His contacts with\nhis mother-in-law are limited to about twice yearly brief greetings if he is present when\nhis spouse calls her (Tr. 89). He claims to not now know whether his spouse is sending\nher mother financial assistance, or if so, the amount, since they maintain separate bank\naccounts (Tr. 165-66). His spouse visits her mother in Nigeria about once every four\nyears. He testified her last trip to Nigeria was three or four years ago (Tr. 173).\n  \nNigeria is the most populous nation in Africa. Despite its oil wealth, the country\nremains highly underdeveloped and mired in poverty. An ethnically diverse country,\nNigeria has experienced periods of political instability, with conflict along ethnic and\ngeographic lines and dominated by military coups, since gaining its independence from\nBritain in October 1960. After 16 years of consecutive military rule, Nigeria transitioned\nin May 1999 to a civilian, democratic form of government, led by President Olusegun\nObasanjo, who oversaw a marked improvement in human rights and democratic\npractices. In October 2001, then President Obasanjo formed a National Security\nCommission to address the issue of communal violence. In May 2006, an attempt to\namend the Constitution to allow a third presidential term for Obasanjo was soundly\ndefeated in a democratic and relatively peaceful process. Subsequent national and\nstate elections in 2007 were seriously flawed with credible reports of malfeasance and\nvote rigging, and marked by violence. In May 2007, a moderate respected state\ngovernor, Umaru Yar\u2019Adua, assumed the presidency of Nigeria, vowing peace and\nsecurity in the Niger Delta and reform of the oil and gas industry as among his top\npriorities.\nIn 2008, the government\u2019s human rights record remained poor. Corruption was\n\u201cmassive, widespread, and pervasive, at all levels of government and society.\u201d\nGovernment officials at all levels continued to commit serious abuses in several aspects\n(limits on citizens\u2019 right to change their government, extrajudicial killings, and excessive\nforce by security forces acting with impunity, police mistreatment of civilians to extort\nmoney, torture of detainees, arbitrary arrest and pretrial detention, harsh and life-\nthreatening prison conditions, executive influence on the judiciary and judicial\ncorruption, arbitrary interference with privacy, restrictions on some civil liberties,\nincluding freedom of speech and the press. Other rights, such as freedom of association\nand religion, were generally respected. Laws prohibiting discrimination, societal abuses,\nand trafficking in persons, were not effectively enforced.\nNigeria remains relatively stable, although it continues to experience localized\ncivil unrest and communal (inter ethnic) violence. In the oil-producing region of the Niger\nRiver Delta, resident U.S. citizens and other foreigners have frequently been threatened\nand held hostage during labor disputes. Due to the continued risks of kidnapping,\nrobbery, and other armed attacks in the region, and of violent crime throughout the\ncountry, the U.S. State Department in December 2008 warned U.S. citizens of the risks\nof travel to and within Nigeria, and recommended avoiding all but essential travel to the\nNiger Delta States of Bayelsa, Delta, and Rivers. As a result of recent incidents of\nviolence in the city of Jos, the U.S. diplomatic mission in March 2009 limited travel to\n\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has held it reasonable for the administrative judge to consider the\n11\nsignificance not only of an applicant\u2019s ties, but also of his spouse\u2019s ties to a foreign country, and the possible\neffect they may have on Applicant\u2019s contacts under Guideline B. See ISCR Case No. 01-02452 (App. Bd. Nov.\n21, 2002). \n11\nthat area to official travel only. In April 2009, American citizens were warned of a\npossible attack against diplomatic missions in Lagos. Nigerian police or other law\nenforcement officials do not always immediately inform the U.S. Embassy or Consulate\nof the arrest or detention of a U.S. citizen.\nSince it gained independence, Nigerian foreign policy has been focused on Africa\nand the goals of African unity and independence, peaceful settlement of disputes,\nnonalignment, non-intentional interference in the internal affairs of other nations, and\nregional economic cooperation and development. Over the past decade, Nigeria has\nplayed a pivotal role in support of peace in Africa, providing the bulk of the troops for UN\npeacekeeping efforts in the region.\nThe U.S.-Nigerian bilateral relationship has continued to improve since the\ninauguration of the first Obasanjo government and the restoration of basic democracy in\n1999. Nigeria is the U.S.\u2019 largest trading partner in sub-Saharan Africa, due to the high\nlevel of petroleum imports from Nigeria. Nigeria lent strong diplomatic support to U.S.\ncounterterrorism efforts in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks,\ncondemning the attacks and supporting military action against the Taliban and Al-Qaida.\nNigeria has been a leader in forging an antiterrorism consensus among states in Sub-\nSaharan Africa. Nigeria is a member of several international organizations, including the\nUnited Nations and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). \nANALYSIS\nGuideline B\u2014Foreign Influence\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has\ndivided loyalties, or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a\nforeign person, group, organization, or government that is not in U.S. interests, or is\nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this\nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the\nforeign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as to whether the foreign country is known to target United States\ncitizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. AG\n\u00b6 6.\nIt is undisputed that Applicant has foreign connections that present a potential\nrisk of divided loyalties. Applicant\u2019s mother, three of his four siblings, and his mother-in-\nlaw, are resident citizens of Nigeria.  The salient issue is whether these foreign\n11\ncontacts present a heightened risk. See AG \u00b6 7(a) (stating, \u201ccontact with a foreign family\nmember, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of\n\n12\nor resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion.\u201d); AG \u00b6 7(d) (stating,\n\u201csharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that\nrelationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion.\u201d). The nature and strength of the family ties, the country involved, and the\noccupations, activities, and/or associations of the foreign family members are all\nrelevant in assessing whether there is a heightened risk.\nBy virtue of their Nigerian residency and citizenship, these family members are\nsubject to the laws of Nigeria and are within the physical reach of the Nigerian\nauthorities. Likely concerns for his present employment have led him to downplay the\nsignificance of his understandably close familial ties to Nigeria. Applicant testified that\nhe communicates with his mother about once a year. He commented, \u201cTo tell you the\ntruth, right now, not that often, unless she calls just to say hello to my wife, and she\nsays, oh, is your husband there? And if I am there I say hi mom, and that\u2019s it.\u201d (Tr. 89).\nHe denied any contact with his siblings since February 2008 (Tr. 169). But Applicant\ntold a government investigator in May 2008 that he called his mother about twice a\nmonth and he spoke to one or more of his siblings in Nigeria about three times a year.\nEven assuming he  reduced the frequency of his contacts because of concerns over his\nclearance, it is difficult to believe his contact with his mother is only once a year and\nonly when his mother calls his home. It is evident he feels some affection and familial\nobligation for his mother. In addition to some minor financial support, he travelled to\nNigeria to see her in 1995, 1998, 2001, and 2003. A close friend of Applicant\u2019s testified\nthat he met Applicant\u2019s mother when she was staying with Applicant in the U.S. for\nabout a year \u201ca couple of years ago\u201d (Tr. 51). Applicant submits that his friend was\nmistaken about the recency of his mother\u2019s stay in the U.S., which occurred almost 18\nyears ago (Tr. 87). Whether her stay was recent or in the distant past, it is further\nevidence of their close relationship. AG \u00b6 7(a) applies primarily because of Applicant\u2019s\nrelationship with his mother. While Applicant does not have the same level of contact\nwith, or affection for, his siblings, there is a heightened risk because of his siblings\u2019\nrelationships to their mother, especially his brother who lives with their mother.\nAG \u00b6 7(d) also applies because of the bond Applicant\u2019s spouse has with her\nmother. Applicant testified that he does not speak with his mother-in-law often, and\nthere is no evidence to the contrary. Applicant was unable or unwilling to testify at his\nhearing about the frequency of his spouse\u2019s contacts with her mother. He indicated that\nhis spouse travelled to Nigeria to see her mother about once every four years, and that\nher last trip, to his knowledge, was \u201cabout three or four years ago\u201d (Tr. 173). Yet, he had\ntold a government investigator in May 2008 that his spouse was in Nigeria as they\nspoke, to attend a family funeral and to visit her mother. Moreover, he also indicated\nthat his spouse provided between $600 and $800 per year to her mother. There is no\nevidence that those ties have diminished.\nAt the same time, the nature and extent of Applicant\u2019s and his spouse\u2019s ties to\ntheir Nigerian relatives as described by Applicant in May 2008 are what one might\nreasonably expect of any immigrants with parents or siblings living in a distant country.\n\n13\nThere is nothing about his siblings\u2019 employments that heighten the risk of undue foreign\ninfluence. His mother had been a farmer and produce vendor before she retired.\nSimilarly, his mother-in-law sold food on the streets but is now retired as well. His\nbrother owns a bicycle parts shop, and his sisters are street vendors. His sisters\u2019\nspouses are both farmers. None have been employed by the Nigerian government or\nserved in the Nigerian military. Furthermore, given the friendly relations between Nigeria\nand the U.S. since Nigeria\u2019s transition to civilian rule in 1999, Applicant is not likely to\nfind himself in a position of having to choose between the interests of his siblings in\nNigeria and the U.S. See \u00b6 8(a) (stating, \u201cthe nature of the relationships with the foreign\npersons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of\nthose persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group,\norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.\u201d). Despite some ongoing\nhuman rights abuses and persistent ethnic conflicts in some regions, Nigeria is not\nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information or to sponsor terrorism. To\nthe contrary, Nigeria lent strong diplomatic support to U.S. counterterrorism efforts in\nthe aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, condemning the attacks and\nsupporting military action against the Taliban and Al-Qaida. Nigeria has also been a\nleader in forging an antiterrorism consensus among states in Sub-Saharan Africa. The\nU.S. is a significant trading partner, and Nigeria is not likely to jeopardize these interests\nby pressuring its law-abiding citizens. AG \u00b6 8(a) applies.\nIn the event that Applicant found himself in a position of being forced to choose\nbetween the interests of his family members in Nigeria and the interests of the U.S.,\nApplicant has persuaded me that he can be expected to resolve those interests in favor\nof the U.S. where he and his spouse have chosen to pursue their careers as an\nengineer and a nurse and raise their children. Applicant had been in the U.S. about 16\nyears before he became a U.S. citizen, but he also has a record of contributions to the\nU.S. defense effort through his present employment since 1997.\nApplicant and his spouse\u2019s financial assets (home, savings, retirement assets,\njob income) are all in the U.S. He had owned two plots of land in Nigeria, but they were\napparently sold almost ten years ago. Applicant does not intend to return to Nigeria\npermanently, as evidenced by his surrender of his Nigerian passport and acquisition of\nU.S. citizenship. He has a record of considerable community involvement in the U.S.\nHis children are U.S. native resident citizens. Applicant satisfies AG \u00b6 8(b), \u201cthere is no\nconflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the\nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such\ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be\nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d\nGuideline F\u2014Financial Considerations\nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:\n\n14\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant, who had been covering about $400 of the $2,100 monthly mortgage\npayment on his old home, began to have financial problems after his tenants stopped\npaying any rent in 2005. By mid-2006, he had exhausted his savings and allowed the\nhouse to be foreclosed. In 2006/07, he stopped paying on three sizeable installment\nloans (SOR 2.b and 2.h, and a credit union loan not alleged) and on some revolving\ncharge accounts. After the lender redeemed the property, Applicant had no liability for\nthe primary mortgage, but he still owed delinquent debt of approximately $98,000\n(including the credit union loan). Security concerns are raised by an \u201cinability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and by \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nSee AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).\nMoreover, AG \u00b6 19(e), \u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be\nindicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ratio, and/or other financial analysis,\u201d is also implicated. Applicant has a history\nof significant reliance on consumer credit. He took on a $36,073 car loan in February\n2006 when he was struggling to make the mortgage payments for his rental property.\nAs of May 2008, he was about $1,300 behind in his utility payments (gas and electricity)\non his current residence, and his monthly expenses exceeded his income by about\n$779. He satisfied the credit union loan in September 2008 through a refinancing of his\nhome mortgage, but he increased his overall debt in the process. While he apparently\nhas been paying his mortgage and car loans on time, his outstanding delinquent debt of\nabout $92,500 exceeds his annual income and there is no indication that his spouse\nhas increased the amount of her financial contribution to the household.\nConcerning potential mitigating conditions, his financial problems are considered\ntoo recent and repeated to apply AG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was\nso infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is not likely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d applies, but only in part. Applicant testified\nhe was pressured into buying his current home by his spouse, who did not want to live\nin the residence Applicant had shared with his first wife (Tr. 90). The decision to rent out\ntheir previous home rather than list it for sale was also within his control. However,\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are attributable in significant part to the loss of rental\nincome and then no buyer for the home. He did not earn enough to cover the mortgages\non two houses, and apparently he could not convince his spouse to cover more than\n15% of their household expenses. But AG \u00b6 20(b) does not mitigate or extenuate the\n\n15\nfinancial  judgment concerns raised by him taking out an automobile loan of $36,073\nwhen he was having trouble meeting his other financial obligations, and by his failure to\nremain current in his utility costs on his new home. Applicant testified that his current\npaycheck covers his bills, but he provided no documentation showing he had satisfied\nthe utility arrearage.\nMoreover, it would be premature at this juncture to fully apply AG \u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe\nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d Applicant received\nabout three hours of online financial counseling in April 2009, where he learned about\nmoney management and that it was \u201cnot good\u201d to hold too many credit cards (Ex. K, Tr.\n151-52). Applicant testified with no rebuttal that he created a budget as a result of the\ncounseling and he relies on his debit card for purchases (Tr. 152). These are positive\nsteps toward avoiding recurrence of similar financial problems in the future. Yet, these\nare very recent changes in his financial practices. While he paid the debt in SOR 2.a in\n2004, and had been paying into a debt resolution plan for one year, he has not credibly\nexplained his failure to pay off one or more of the smaller debts in the SOR (e.g., SOR\n2.e or 2.g).  \nAfter his May 2008 subject interview, when it became clear that his financial\nproblems were an issue for his clearance, Applicant contracted with a debt\nmanagement company for assistance in resolving his delinquent debts (SOR 2.b-2.g\nand 2.i). He did not include the $49,525 debt in SOR 2.h because it had been charged\noff. Beginning on July 21, 2008, the debt resolution firm began debiting about $375 or\n$385 from Applicant\u2019s bank account each month (Exs. 3, O). While it qualifies as a\ngood-faith effort on Applicant\u2019s behalf under AG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d it does not fully\nmitigate his exhibited financial irresponsibility in taking on more debt than he could\nreasonably afford, and in neglecting his delinquent accounts until they became an issue\nfor his clearance. He took on a car loan of $36,073 in 2006 when he was having trouble\npaying some of his financial obligations. In September 2008, he took out a new\nmortgage that exceeds the value of his home. He also started a doctoral study program\nat some financial cost to him in out-of-pocket costs or student loans, or both, when he\nowed about $92,000 in delinquent debt. Even if I accept his uncorroborated assertion\nthat his present paycheck is sufficient to cover his monthly obligations, he remains\nunder a substantial debt burden that is not likely to be resolved in the near future. He\nshowed himself to be vulnerable to pressures from his spouse (i.e., the house purchase,\naccepting her limited financial contributions to the household) in the past and there is no\nindication of a change in that situation. \nWhole-Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life\nto make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\nAG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant understandably maintains close personal ties to his mother. His\nspouse shares similar bonds of ties of affection and obligation to her mother as well.\n\n16\nAlthough the risk of undue foreign influence is heightened somewhat because of these\nforeign family ties, Applicant has stronger countervailing ties to the U.S. in his home,\nimmediate family (including children who were born here), and his career that he is not\nlikely to jeopardize by succumbing to any undue foreign influence.\nHis desire to retain his defense contractor employment, rather than problems\ncomprehending the English language, is seen as the likely cause of discrepancies in the\nrecord concerning his and his spouse\u2019s contacts with foreign family members (e.g.,\nwhether his spouse last travelled to Nigeria in May 2008 or three or four years ago,\nwhether he called his mother twice a month or once yearly, whether his mother was in\nthe U.S. a couple of years ago or about 18 years ago). This tendency to act in self-\ninterest, which is incompatible with a security clearance, is similarly evident in his\ndisregard of his consumer credit obligations until they became an issue for his security\nclearance. AG \u00b6 2(a)(3) (noting the relevancy of, \u201cthe frequency and recency of the\nconduct\u201d). While his financial problems are attributable in part to a loss of rental income,\nsee AG \u00b6 2(a)(2), (\u201cthe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation\u201d), Applicant\u2019s financial situation was not helped by his\ndecisions to take on sizeable loans. Giving a debt resolution firm authority to debit his\naccount and to make settlement decisions on his behalf may eventually lead to a\nresolution in the future, but it is not persuasive of whether Applicant has the financial\nknowledge, intent, and assets to live within his means. AG \u00b6 2(a)(6) (stating, \u201cthe\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes\u201d). He\nhas taken some control by relying on his debit card for purchases and by maintaining a\nseparate account from his spouse, but these are very recent changes. Furthermore,\nthere is a \u201cpotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(a)(8). The\nunresolved delinquent debt exceeds his annual income. Applicant has a reputation for\nhard work and good character among those who know him, but based on the record\nbefore me, I am unable to find at this time that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to continue his access to classified information.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nFOR  APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n17\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

    "summary": "findings of fact: Applicant works for a federal contractor as an executive assistant. She has two children. Her husband is unemployed and has not worked since 2005. Applicant has numerous delinquent debts, totaling $13,687. Although Applicant denied certain debts and claimed that others were paid (either in full or in part), she provided no corroboration for these statements. The Judge considered pertinent mitigating conditions, but she 1 concluded that Applicant had failed to meet her burden of persuasion. The Judge noted that, in addition to not corroborating her claims of payment, Applicant had not received financial counseling, had not provided a credible basis for disputing her debts, and had generally failed to demonstrate a track record of responsible action. Applicant cites to a credit report she submitted to the Judge. The Judge noted that that credit report was incomplete, comprising only the first four pages of a 22-page document. It is appropriate for a Judge to assign diminished weight, or no weight at all, to such an exhibit. In support of her appeal Applicant has submitted new matters not contained in the case record, which the Board cannot consider. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.

Her husband is unemployed and has not worked since\n2005.  Applicant has numerous delinquent debts, totaling $13,687.  Although Applicant denied\ncertain debts and claimed that others were paid (either in full or in part), she provided no\ncorroboration for these statements.   The Judge considered pertinent mitigating conditions, but she\n1\nconcluded that Applicant had failed to meet her burden of persuasion.

Mendez, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the government\u2019s trustworthiness concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation is denied. \n \nOn May 8, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the trustworthiness concerns under \nGuideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) \nRegulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as amended \n(Regulation), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing May 29, 2009, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. I was assigned the case on July 21, 2009. DOHA issued \nthe Notice of Appearance on July 31, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled on \n1 \n \nSeptember 30, 2009\n\n2 \n \n                                                          \nSeptember 3, 2009. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were \nadmitted without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf and offered Exhibits \n(AE) A through C, which were admitted without objection. The record was held open \nuntil September 17, 2009, to allow Applicant an opportunity to submit additional \ndocuments, which she did. They were marked as AE D through G, which were admitted \nwithout objection.1 DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on September 14, \n2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR Applicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b, I.d, 1.e, 1.g, 1.i and 1.j, and denied the remaining allegations. Her admissions are \nincorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 23 years old and has worked for a federal contractor as an executive \nassistant since May 2008. She married in 2006. She has two children, ages 5 and 3. \nHer husband is unemployed and has not worked since 2005. He does not receive \nunemployment benefits or any other type of benefits. He does not care for his children \nduring the day. The children attend educational programs that do not require a fee. \nApplicant earns about $45,000 annually.2 \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing the loan in SOR \u00b6 1.b, but disputed the loan in \u00b6 1.a.3 \nShe disputed the debt with the credit bureau, but did not contact the creditor, and she \nhas not received any correspondence from them. She did not provide any \ndocumentation at her hearing. However, she provided a document after her hearing that \nwas submitted to the credit bureau on September 16, 2009, disputing a debt. It is \nunclear if the dispute pertains to SOR \u00b61.b. because it is not specifically identified.4  \nShe stated at her hearing that she took out student loans in either 2007 or 2008. In her \npost-hearing letter she stated that she is now disputing the debts in both \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, \nbut failed to provide a basis for the dispute. Both debts are listed on Applicant\u2019s credit \nreport. Both loans were opened in 2008. She stated at her hearing that she contacted \nthe creditor and asked about the debt in \u00b6 1.b, but did not ask about the debt in \u00b6 1.a.5  \n \n \nApplicant disputes the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($395) as not hers.6 The debt is for a \ncredit card from a retail store. She admits she was an authorized user on an account \n \n1 AE D is a fax cover sheet and a letter from Applicant; AE E is a copy of a dispute letter to \nEquifax, but it does not address what debt is in dispute. AE F contains pages 1-4 of a 22-page Equifax \nCredit Report; AE G is a two-page document of negative accounts from the Equifax credit file. \n \n2 Tr. 34-39. \n \n3 GE 2 at 3; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 2. \n \n4 AE E. \n \n5 Tr. 40-50; GE 2 at 3; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 2. \n \n6 GE 3 at 2. \n\n3 \n \n                                                          \nshe held jointly with her mother. She contacted the creditor and was advised the \naccount was in her name, with her date of birth and social security number. There is no \nother name on the account. She was told she would be provided with documentation \nand information on how to dispute the debt. She admitted she had this retailer\u2019s credit \ncard and made some charges on it, but does not remember when she made the \ntransaction.7 She stated she disputed the debt with the credit bureau. No specific \ndocumentation was provided.8 \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d ($1,081) is from a checking account Applicant had in \n2005. She believed it was an overdrawn account.9 She contacted the creditor three \nweeks ago and they agreed to settle the account for half of the amount. Applicant was \nrequired to pay $153 initially and then $50 a month. She stated she made the first \npayment and the next payment was due on September 15, 2009. The record was held \nopen to allow Applicant an opportunity to provide proof of the initial payment and make \nanother payment and provide proof of that payment. She did not provide proof of either \npayment. Applicant\u2019s post-hearing letter stated that this account was removed from her \ncredit report.10 \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e ($797) is from a checking account Applicant had in 2006. \nShe believed it was an overdrawn account.11 She contacted the creditor three weeks \nago and agreed to settle the account for one-half of the balance. She stated she made \nan initial payment of $120 on August 17, 2009, and then was to pay $75 on September \n15, 2009. The record was held open to allow Applicant an opportunity to provide proof \nof the $120 payment and to pay the $75. She did not provide proof of payments. Her \npost-hearing letter stated that this account was removed from her credit report.12  \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f ($185) is for a cable television account. The account was \nfirst reported in her credit report in 2002. Applicant disputes this account. She contacted \nthe creditor and advised them that she was not old enough to have an account when \nthey first reported it as delinquent. She disputed the debt with the credit bureau. No \ndocumentation was provided, but it is clear she was not old enough to open an account \nin 2002. This debt is resolved.13 \n \n \n7 GE 4 at 3; GE 5 at 4. \n \n8 Tr. 50-53. \n \n9 GE 2 at 6, GE 4 at 4. \n \n10 Tr. 53-56; AE D, F, G.

Applicant \npaid some of the loan back, but then the interest escalated.14 She contacted the creditor \nand agreed to make monthly payments of $50. The record was held open to allow her to \nprovide proof that she made a payment. No proof was provided. 15 \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h ($88) is to a bank where Applicant had an account. It was \na checking account that had overdraft fees.16 She stated she settled the account, paid \n$44, and had proof of the payment. She did not provide proof of payment. She stated in \nher post-hearing letter that the account was removed from her credit report.17 \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in 2003. She attended college for a period \nof time after high school, but did not earn a degree. She went back to college sometime \nin 2006. She has earned a total of about 40 college credits. She believed that her \nmother was paying for her college in 2003, but is not sure if her mother took out a loan \nin her name for her college expenses. Applicant asked her mother about the account \nand her mother could not remember the debt. Applicant stated she could not remember \nit either. She contacted the creditor about the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i and has set up a \npayment plan to pay $50 a month toward the debt. She made her first payment in \nAugust 2009. Although she thought her mother was paying her tuition, the loan is in \nApplicant\u2019s name.18 Her 2008 tax refund was applied to student loan debt. She believes \n$4,000 was applied. No proof was provided regarding the payment plan or that she has \nmade any payments.19 \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j ($305) is for phone services. Applicant stated she paid the \naccount in June 2009, and had documents to show she is current in paying her bill. The \nrecord was held open to allow her an opportunity to provide the document. She did not. \nShe stated in her post-hearing letter that the account was removed from her credit \nreport.20  \n \n \nApplicant does not own a car. She does not have any money in her savings \naccount, and has a nominal amount in her checking account. She does not contribute to \na retirement plan. She has not had financial counseling. She filed her taxes on time. \nShe has no other debts. She does not have credit cards. She is trying to support her \n \n14 GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 5. \n \n15 Tr. 60-63; AE D, F, G.

She is \nattempting to take control over her financial situation and believes that with the \nadditional income, there will be change.22 \n \n \nApplicant provided character letters from people who believe she is a trustworthy \nperson, a good role model, intelligent and a spiritual woman.23 She volunteers in her \ncommunity and is considered dependable, organized, efficient, and has excellent \ncommunication skills.24 She is also considered hard-working and an excellent wife, \nparent and friend. She is considered a good person who deserves a chance to better \nherself.25 \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for \n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n \n21 Tr. 67-68. \n \n22 AE D. \n \n23 AE A. \n \n24 AE B. \n \n25 AE C. \n\n6 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations \nis set out in AG & 18:   \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n\n7 \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant has approximately $13,687 in delinquent debt that remains unresolved \nor unpaid. She made statements that some of her debts were paid, and others were \nsettled. She was making payments on some debts, and others she disputed. She did \nnot provide documents to support her statements, even though the record was held \nopen for this purpose. I find the above disqualifying conditions have been raised.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \n \n \nApplicant did not provide proof that she made payments on any of her debts or \nthat she has resolved her debts. She admitted certain debts and then later disputed \nthem, but did not explain why she did not owe the debts. The delinquent debts remain a \nconcern because they have not been resolved. Applicant stated she had made \npayments on some of the debts and had upcoming payments due to settle the debts. \nDespite leaving the record open to allow her to provide proof of her past payments and \nto show consistent good-faith payments, she did not. She stated certain debts had \ndropped off of her credit report, but she did not provide a complete credit report or \nexplain why they were no longer listed. I find mitigating condition (a) does not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant appears to be a hard worker who is attempting to support her whole \nfamily on one income. It appears there were periods of time when she was \nunderemployed and had financial difficulty. Mitigating condition (b) partially applies \n\n8 \n \nbecause she was underemployed. However, for full application of the mitigating \ncondition, she must show she acted responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant \nstated she was making payments on certain debts and admitted owing many of the \ndebts. She did not provide proof of her payments. She stated many of the debts were \nno longer on her credit report, but she failed to provide a complete credit report or \nexplain why they were no longer included. Therefore, I find she did not act responsibly \nunder the circumstances. \n \n \nThere is no evidence Applicant has received financial counseling. She failed to \nprovide documented proof that she has initiated a good-faith effort to resolve her debts. \nShe failed to provide proof that the problems are being resolved or under control. She \ndid not provide a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of her debts. Although she \nprovided a document from the credit bureau that disputes a debt, it does not detail what \ndebt it applies to and she did not provide information as to why she disputed it. I find \nnone of the remaining mitigating conditions apply.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They are:  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public \ntrust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Although Applicant receives high \npraise from those who provided character letters, she has numerous delinquent debts. \nShe has not taken enough initiative to resolve the debts. She made statements about \nwhat she did to settle some debts, but did not provide proof of her actions. She has \noutstanding student loans, but does not appear to know their status. She stated she had \nnegotiated settlement agreements on some debts and was making payments, but did \nnot provide proof, despite being given additional time. The burden is on Applicant to \nshow proof of her payments. She did not meet this burden. Undoubtedly, Applicant is a \nhard-working mother who is trying to improve herself. She provided a post-hearing letter \nstating she was going to start a part-time job and her husband was going to work. \n\n9 \n \nThese are steps in the right direction, but until she proves she has resolved some of her \ndebts and has a consistent track record regarding her financial situation, it is too early to \nconclude her finances are not a concern. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nserious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust \nposition. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \ntrustworthiness concerns arising from her financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g-1.j: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n______________________________ \nCarol G.

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on May 12, 2008. On July \n17, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent him a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his application, \nciting security concerns under Guidelines J and G. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on \nDecember 29, 2005.  \n \nMarch 16, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on September 23, 2009; answered it on September \n29, 2009; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel \nwas ready to proceed on November 3, 2009, and the case was assigned to me on \nDecember 16, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on December 18, 2009, \nscheduling the hearing for January 6, 2010. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 7 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through O, which were \nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on January 8, 2010. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in the SOR. \nHis admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 30-year-old engineer employed by a defense contractor. He has \nworked for his current employer since September 2004. He has never held a security \nclearance. \n \n \nApplicant graduated from college in June 2002 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in \nengineering graphics and design. He received a master\u2019s degree in biomedical \nengineering in December 2006.  \n \n \nIn September 1998, Applicant and several friends were stopped for speeding. \nApplicant was not the driver. All were administered breathalyzer tests, and all were cited \nfor underage possession of alcohol. Applicant was released to his mother\u2019s custody. He \npaid a $100 fine (GX 2 at 7). \n \n \nIn July 2000, Applicant held a party at his parents\u2019 home while they were away. A \nneighbor called the police because of the noise. A local county sheriff observed alcohol \nin the home and charged Applicant with underage possession of alcohol. He paid a \n$100 fine (GX 2 at 6-7; GX 6). \n \n \nIn December 2000, shortly after his 21st birthday, Applicant was driving home \nafter consuming alcohol at a Christmas party. A police officer stopped him for speeding \nand noticed a bottle of vodka in the back seat. Applicant failed several field sobriety \ntests as well as a breathalyzer test. He was charged with operating a motor vehicle \nwhile visibly impaired by liquor. He pleaded guilty to operating a motor vehicle under the \ninfluence of liquor, and he paid a fine and costs totaling $835 (GX 2 at 6; GX 5). He was \nrequired to attend a victims\u2019 impact panel and attend a one-day class on the effects of \nalcohol. He testified he was advised to attend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings and \nhe did so, but his testimony was vague on the extent of his AA participation (Tr. 70). \n \n \nAfter his arrest in December 2000, Applicant continued to drink and drive \u201cmaybe \na few times a year.\u201d He testified he was heavily involved in working full-time and \nattending school, and he was more cautious about drinking and driving (Tr. 61-62). \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nIn July 2001, Applicant was out drinking with college friends, and he decided to \nsteal an advertising banner hanging outside a bar and put it in his house (Tr. 63-65). \nThe record does not reflect the extent of his alcohol consumption. He was arrested, \nconvicted of larceny, and fined $100. After one year with no further criminal charges, the \nlarceny charges were dismissed (GX 4). He wrote a letter of apology to the bar owner \n(GX 2 at 7).  \n \n \nIn August 2007, Applicant was driving home from a party at which he had been \nconsuming alcohol steadily for about eight hours (Tr. 44). He was driving at a speed \nwell in excess of the speed limit when he swerved to avoid a car that was stopped (Tr. \n63). He struck another car that was making a left turn, seriously injuring two passengers \nin the car he struck. The police administered a blood-alcohol test that registered .26%. \nA second test at the scene registered .24% (GX 3 at 2-3). A third test at the police \nstation registered .20% (GX 3 at 4). Applicant was charged with driving while intoxicated \nand causing serious injury, a felony. Pursuant to a plea agreement, he pleaded no \ncontest. In June 2008, he was placed on supervised probation for four years, sentenced \nto 30 days in jail (deferred, conditioned on successfully completing probation), ordered \nto perform 60 hours of community service, required to pay $6,680 in court costs, and \nrequired to pay restitution of about $13,700 (GX 3 at 8). His insurance company paid \nthe restitution (GX 2 at 6).  \n \nAs of the date of the hearing, Applicant had complied with all the terms and \nconditions of his probation (AX D). Although his four years on probation will not be \ncompleted until June 2012, he testified he expects to be released from probation in \nJune 2010, based on his conversations with his probation officer (Tr. 51-52).  \n \n \nAs a result of the August 2007 accident, Applicant sought treatment for his \nexcessive alcohol consumption. He received counseling three times a week in August \nand September 2007 and monthly counseling from September 2007 to April 2008 (GX 2 \nat 7). Upon discharge from the program, he was diagnosed by a medical doctor and a \nlicensed clinical social worker as alcohol dependent in remission. According to the \ndischarge summary, he met all the goals of the program, maintained his sobriety, and \nmade appropriate lifestyle changes. His relapse potential was evaluated as low (GX 2 at \nR-2). He attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings once or twice a week until April \n2008 (Tr. 57). No aftercare was prescribed.  \n \nApplicant married in October 2009 (Tr. 39). He has fully disclosed his previous \nalcohol involvement to his wife, his parents, and his sister (Tr. 80, 82).  \n \nApplicant has not consumed alcohol since August 2007. He moved to another \nstate after his last conviction to accept a new position with the same employer. He has \nnot attended AA meetings or received additional counseling after April 2008. He has a \nnew circle of friends, and they are focused on work and family rather than partying. He \ntestified his \u201csupport mechanism\u201d is his work and church involvement, his wife, his \nfriends, and his colleagues (Tr. 76). He is active in his church. He performed his \ncommunity service with a church-based charitable organization, and he continued to \n\n \n4 \n \n \ndonate his time to that organization after his community service obligation was \ncompleted (AX E; Tr. 77. 83-84). He and his wife have become involved in physical \nfitness, and he is training to run a marathon (Tr. 87).  \n \n \nA former supervisor described Applicant as dependable, reliable, and trustworthy \n(AX A). A friend who has known him since 1985 considers him dedicated and loyal (AX \nB). A coworker for three years considers him reliable, dedicated, and responsible (AX \nC). Numerous supervisors have recognized him as a technically proficient and creative \ndesigner and a dedicated, hardworking employee (AX F, I, J, M, N, L, and O). He has \ntwice received monetary awards for his achievements (AX G and H).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges four alcohol-related convictions (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e) \nand a larceny conviction (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Applicant has admitted all the allegations under \nthis guideline. The concern raised by criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30 as follows: \n\u201cCriminal conduct creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d  \n \n \nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include \n\u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d and \u201callegation or admission of \ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally \nprosecuted, or convicted.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c). Applicant\u2019s record of arrests and \nconvictions are sufficient to raise these two disqualifying conditions, shifting the burden \nto him to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).   \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cso \nmuch time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(a). Applicant\u2019s \ncriminal conduct did not occur under unusual circumstances making it unlikely to recur. \nThus, the key element in determining whether this mitigating condition applies is the first \nthe first prong of AG \u00b6 32(a) (\u201cso much time has elapsed\u201d). This prong focuses on \n\n \n6 \n \n \nwhether the criminal conduct was recent. There are no Abright line@ rules for determining \nwhen conduct is Arecent.@ The determination must be based on a careful evaluation of \nthe totality of the evidence. If the evidence shows Aa significant period of time has \npassed without any evidence of misconduct,@ then an administrative judge must \ndetermine whether that period of time demonstrates Achanged circumstances or conduct \nsufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.@ ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). \n \nApplicant\u2019s last criminal conduct was in August 2007, more than two years before \nthe hearing. He stopped consuming alcohol in August 2007, successfully completed an \nalcohol treatment program in April 2008, moved to another state, made a new circle of \nfriends, married in October 2009, and has shifted his focus from heavy social drinking to \nphysical fitness and exercise. He has abstained from alcohol and further misconduct for \n\u201ca significant period of time.\u201d On the other hand, his two-plus years of responsible \nconduct are less significant in the context of his serious misconduct in August 2007 after \nabout six years of responsible behavior following his larceny conviction. He is still on \nprobation and knows he is under scrutiny. Although he is alcohol dependent, he relies \non his own self-designed support system rather than an external system such as AA or \na counselor. I conclude it is too soon to conclude that he is rehabilitated, because he \nhas not had sufficient time to convincingly demonstrate that he can maintain sobriety \nand responsible behavior without the inhibiting influence of a probation officer and a \nformal support structure such as AA or periodic counseling. I conclude AG \u00b6 32(a) is not \nestablished. \n \nSecurity concerns arising from criminal behavior also may be mitigated if \u201cthere is \nevidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time \nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n32(d). For the reasons set out above in the discussion of AG \u00b6 32(a), I am not satisfied \nthat he has demonstrated successful rehabilitation.  \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant consumed alcohol, at times to excess and to the \npoint of intoxication, from 1998 to 2007 (SOR \u00b6 2.a). It also cross-alleges the alcohol-\nrelated criminal conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e (SOR \u00b6 2.b). Finally, it \nalleges Applicant received treatment for alcohol dependency from August 2007 to April \n2008 (SOR \u00b6 2.c). Applicant has admitted these allegations. \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21 as follows: \u201cExcessive \nalcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure \nto control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d The following disqualifying conditions are raised by the evidence: \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving \nwhile under the influence. . . , regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of \nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as \nan alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; and \nAG \u00b6 22(e): evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a \nlicensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized \nalcohol treatment program.  \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cso much time has \npassed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 23(a). For the reasons set \nout above in my discussion of AG \u00b6 32(a), I conclude this mitigating condition is not \nestablished. \n \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or \nher alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to \novercome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol \ndependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\u201d AG \u00b6 23(b). This mitigating \ncondition is established, although, as noted above, I am not satisfied that the \ncircumstances of his abstinence are sufficient to warrant a finding of rehabilitation.  \n \n \nFinally, security concerns under this guideline may be mitigated under AG \u00b6 \n23(d) if \u2014 \n \n[T]he individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s treatment program had any \u201crequired aftercare,\u201d \nbut he has designed his own informal aftercare program. He has satisfied all the other \nrequirements of this mitigating condition. Because he successfully completed his \nalcohol treatment program, I have resolved SOR \u00b6 2.c, alleging the treatment program, \nin his favor. \n \n \nNotwithstanding Appellant\u2019s significant period of abstinence and successful \ncompletion of his alcohol treatment program, he is still under the scrutiny of a probation \n\n \n8 \n \n \nofficer. The persuasive value of his two-plus years of sobriety is diminished by the fact \nthat he relapsed in August 2007 after almost seven years of responsible alcohol \nconsumption. He has chosen to control his alcohol dependence without a formal \nsupport structure such as AA or routine, periodic counseling. Under these \ncircumstances, he needs more time to mitigate the security concerns arising from his \nalcohol consumption.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines J and G in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature, well-educated adult. He is a talented, creative engineer, \nand he has earned the respect of his supervisors, colleagues, and friends. He has made \nmajor lifestyle changes since his alcohol-related conviction in August 2007. He has \nmarried, moved to a new state and a new job, made new friends, abstained from \nalcohol, become involved in his church and his community, and shifted his off-duty \nfocus from social drinking to physical fitness. He was candid, sincere, and remorseful at \nthe hearing.  \n \n \nMost of the conduct raising security concerns occurred while Applicant was either \nunderage or in a college environment. The serious car accident in August 2007 was his \nfirst alcohol-related misconduct after leaving the college environment, and it apparently \nwas a wake-up call. He voluntarily sought and completed treatment, stopped consuming \nalcohol, and made major lifestyle changes. \n \n \nOn the other hand, all his lifestyle changes have occurred while he has been on \nprobation. Although he was optimistic that his probation will be terminated early, the \n\n \n9 \n \n \nrecord reflects that he will be on probation until June 2012. He has completed less than \nhalf of his term of probation. Given his diagnosis of alcohol dependence and his history \nof alcohol-related misconduct, I am concerned about his lack of a formal support system \nsuch as AA or a continuing relationship with a counselor.  \n \n \nApplicant has not had sufficient time to demonstrate that he will continue to \nabstain from alcohol when he is no longer under the scrutiny of a probation officer. \nAlthough he needs more time to demonstrate his rehabilitation, an administrative judge \ndoes not have the authority to grant a conditional clearance. ISCR Case No. 99-0901, \n2000 WL 288429 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2000).   \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines J and \nG, evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, and mindful of my \nobligation to resolve close cases in favor of national security, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns based on his criminal conduct and alcohol \nconsumption. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. If he successfully completes his probation, continues to abstain from \nalcohol, and is sponsored by his employer for a clearance, he may be worthy of \nreconsideration in the future. See Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.37-E3.1.40 (reconsideration \nauthorized after one year). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHEINY, Claude R., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant used marijuana while holding a security clearance. Applicant has failed \nto rebut or mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns under illegal drugs and personal \nconduct. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \n1 \n \n \n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOctober 30, 2009\n\n2 \n \n \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on March 12, 2009, detailing security concerns under \nillegal drugs and personal conduct.  \n \n  \nOn April 22, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and elected to have the matter \ndecided without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the government's case in a \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM), dated July 28, 2009. The FORM contained seven \nattachments. On August 6, 2009, Applicant received a copy of the FORM, along with \nnotice of his opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or \nmitigate the potentially disqualifying conditions.  \n \nResponses to the FORM are due 30 days after receipt of the FORM. Applicant\u2019s \nresponse was due on September 5, 2009. As of October 8, 2009, no response had \nbeen received. On October 9, 2009, I was assigned the case.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, he denied the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6 2.a. \nHe admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d, indicating his illegal drug \nusage occurred in 1994. He also admitted the allegations set forth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and \n1.f. Applicant neither admitted nor denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.b, which related to \nSOR \u00b6 1.f, an allegation he admitted. Applicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are \nincorporated herein. After a thorough review of the record, pleadings, and exhibits, I \nmake the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old systems administrator who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since November 2005, and is seeking to maintain a secret security clearance \ngranted in August 2006. The company\u2019s CEO states Applicant is an outstanding \nmember of the technical staff in both dedication and commitment to duty. (Item 5) In \nDecember 2005, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP). \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana approximately 30 times during high school. (Item 5) He \nwas 16 years old at the time. (Item 5) Applicant stopped using marijuana during his \nsenior year in high school. He also admitted using PCP on one occasion and using \nValium or Percocet on one occasion. (Item 5) \n \n \nIn March 2007, Applicant purchased some marijuana for $20. (Item 6) In June \n2007, he took the marijuana, along with a pipe in which to smoke it, on a camping trip. \nApplicant smoked it on the trip and offered it to others. A park ranger observed several \nindividuals passing around what looked to be a cigarette. (Item 6) When confronted by \nthe park ranger, Applicant admitted the marijuana was his. When asked if he had any \nadditional marijuana, Applicant turned over a baggie containing approximately one \nounce of marijuana. (Item 6) Applicant was taken to the park ranger station and \nreceived a ticket for possession of a controlled substance and possession of drug \nparaphernalia.  \n \n\n3 \n \n \n \nOn February 11, 2008, Applicant entered the Superior Court Drug Diversion \nprogram, which required at least six months of participation. He was required to \ncomplete at least 12 psycho-educations groups, a minimum of one random drug screen \nper week, at least one monthly individual session, appear monthly before the Superior \nCourt, pay $200 court costs, and complete 18 consecutive weeks of negative drug \nscreen results. (Item 5) Applicant paid the $200 and provided a certificate of \nachievement for successfully completing the drug diversion program. The certificate of \nachievement was dated May 27, 2008, which is 15 weeks from entry into the program.  \n \n \nIn a January 2008 security interview with an agent from the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM), Applicant stated he had obtained the marijuana from a friend as a \ngift or \u201ctip.\u201d Applicant stated he helped set up a friend\u2019s home computer network in \nMarch 2007. Applicant asserts the friend gave him a small amount of marijuana for his \nassistance. (Item 5) Applicant accepted the marijuana thinking the use of marijuana \nwould help him and his wife relax following the February 2007 death of his brother-in-\nlaw killed in an automobile accident. When Applicant returned home, he did not tell his \nwife about the marijuana, placed it in his safe, and forgot about it.  \n \n \nIn June 2007, Applicant and friends of his brother-in-law decided to go on a \ncamping trip to remember his brother-in-law. Applicant decided to take the marijuana \nwith him on the camping trip. He also brought a pipe with him to smoke the marijuana. \nApplicant told the park ranger he had purchased the ounce of marijuana three months \nearlier and said he was saving it for a special occasion. (item 6)  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged his use of illegal drugs was an act of stupidity and he \nwill not use illegal drugs again because they are illegal and because his family and \ncareer mean too much to him. (Item 5)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \n\n4 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nDrug Involvement \n \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the security concern concerning drug involvement: \n \n[u]se of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes eight drug involvement-related conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying: \n \n(a) any drug abuse; \n \n(b) testing positive for illegal drug use; \n \n\n5 \n \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug abuse or drug dependence; \n(e) evaluation of drug abuse or drug dependence by a licensed clinical \nsocial worker who is a staff member of a recognized drug treatment \nprogram; \n \n(f) failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed by \na duly qualified medical professional; \n \n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance; and \n \n(h) expressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and \nconvincingly commit to discontinue drug use. \n \nThree drug involvement disqualifying conditions could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d \u201cillegal drug possession,\u201d and \n\u201cany illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c) and \n25(g) apply. The other disqualifying conditions listed in AG \u00b6 25 are not applicable. \nThese disqualifying conditions apply because Applicant used marijuana, PCP, Percocet, \nand Valium. In August 2006, Applicant was granted a secret clearance. His last use of \nmarijuana occurred in June 2007.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 26 provides for potentially applicable drug involvement mitigating \nconditions:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance \nfor any violation; \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand \n\n6 \n \n \n                                                          \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \nSecurity concerns can be mitigated based on AG \u00b6 26(a) by showing that the \ndrug offenses happened so long ago, were so infrequent, or happened under such \ncircumstances that they are unlikely to recur or do not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. There are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for \ndetermining when conduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be based \u201con a careful \nevaluation of the totality of the record within the parameters set by the directive.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). For example, the Appeal Board \ndetermined in ISCR Case No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 1997), that an applicant's last \nuse of marijuana occurring approximately 17 months before the hearing was not recent. \nIf the evidence shows \u201ca significant period of time has passed without any evidence of \nmisconduct,\u201d then an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time \ndemonstrates \u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of \nreform or rehabilitation.\u201d2 \n \nClearly Applicant\u2019s Percocet, Valium, PCP, and marijuana usage, which occurred \nmore than 13 years ago, when Applicant was in high school, is not recent. During the \nlast 13 years, Applicant used marijuana once. That use occurred in June 2007, which \nwas approximately 28 months ago. His last usage was isolated, but is neither in the \ndistant past nor is it very recent. AG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply because his use of \n \n2 ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). In ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. \nBd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board reversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the \nabsence of drug use for five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge \nexcessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 plus years of drug \nuse, and gave too little weight to lifestyle changes and therapy. For the recency analysis the Appeal \nBoard stated:  \n \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although the passage \nof three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did not, standing alone, compel \nthe administrative judge to apply Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of \nlaw, the Judge erred by failing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply \nthat mitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) with ISCR \nCase No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe administrative judge articulated a \nrational basis for why she had doubts about the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at \nalcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) (citation format corrections added). \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-11392 at 1-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2006) the Appeal Board, considered the recency \nanalysis of an administrative judge stating: \n \nThe administrative judge made sustainable findings as to a lengthy and serious history of \nimproper or illegal drug use by a 57-year-old Applicant who was familiar with the security \nclearance process. That history included illegal marijuana use two to three times a year \nfrom 1974 to 2002 [drug use ended four years before hearing]. It also included the illegal \npurchase of marijuana and the use of marijuana while holding a security clearance. \n \n\n7 \n \n \nmarijuana while holding a security clearance casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \nHis abstention from drug use for more than two years, and his recognition of the \nadverse impact on his life of drug abuse, provides some certitude that he will continue \nto abstain from drug use. However, because Applicant chose to have this matter \nhandled administratively, I am unable to evaluate his demeanor, appearance, or form a \npositive determination as to his truthfulness. From the record, I am unable to find \nApplicant was sincere, open, and honest. Therefore, I cannot conclude with reasonable \nconfidence that his illegal drug possession and use will not recur.  \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) lists ways Applicant can demonstrate his intent not to abuse illegal \ndrugs in the future. During the past 13 years, he has used marijuana once. It has not \nbeen shown he associates with drug-using associates and contacts. He has abstained \nfrom drug abuse for more than two years. AG \u00b6 26(b) partially applies.  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(c) and 26(d) are not applicable because Applicant did not abuse \nprescription drugs. The marijuana, PCP, and Percocet or Valium were never prescribed \nfor him. He did not satisfactorily complete a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding rehabilitation and aftercare requirements. He did successfully complete the \ndrug diversion program even though it required 18 weeks of drug screenings and he \ncompleted the program in 15 weeks. \n \nApplicant ended his drug abuse in June 2007, and understands the adverse \nresults from drug abuse. However, Applicant\u2019s marijuana use after having obtained a \nsecret security clearance shows questionable judgment to which none of the mitigating \nconditions are sufficient to mitigate. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe government asserts Applicant lied when he told an OPM investigator he had \nbeen given the marijuana and failed to disclose he had purchased it. It is not important \nto determine whether he purchased the marijuana or if it was given to him. What is \nimportant is Applicant possessed the marijuana for three months, saving it for use on a \nspecial occasion. Possessing the marijuana for three months waiting for the proper \noccasion shows questionable judgment and failure to comply with laws making \n\n8 \n \n \nmarijuana possession illegal. I find against Applicant for his possession of marijuana \nand not for telling conflicting stories about how he obtained it. \n \nWith respect to the personal conduct concerns involving Applicant\u2019s marijuana \nuse after being granted a clearance (SOR \u00b6 1.f), the pertinent disqualifying condition is \nAG \u00b6 16(d)(3), a pattern of rule violations and AG \u00b6 16(e)(1), which states, \u201cpersonal \nconduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if \nknown, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing.\u201d \nCertainly, Applicant\u2019s marijuana use while holding a security clearance violates \nimportant civil and criminal rules in our society, and is conduct a person might wish to \nconceal, as it adversely affects a person\u2019s professional and community standing. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this \ncase: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n\n9 \n \n \n  \nFrom the record as presented, none of the mitigating conditions apply. There is \nno showing Applicant has made any disclosure, which would eliminate vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation or duress. It is noted the personal conduct concerns related to \nhis illegal drug use and use while holding a clearance are well known to the \ngovernment. However, his marijuana use after having obtained a secret security \nclearance shows questionable judgment. His use while holding a clearance cannot be \nmitigated at this time because it is too serious and too recent.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. There is some evidence supporting \napproval of Applicant\u2019s clearance. Applicant first used marijuana and other illegal drugs \nin high school when he was relatively young and immature. He did not use illegal drugs \nfor more than 13 years, which shows he has the ability to abstain from marijuana use for \nlengthy periods of time. Applicant\u2019s most recent marijuana use occurred more than two \nyears ago. His most recent use was a single event.  \n \nThere is no evidence of disloyalty or that he would intentionally violate national \nsecurity. Applicant contributes to his company and the Department of Defense. His \ncharacter and good work performance show some responsibility, rehabilitation and \nmitigation. His supervisors evidently support him or he would not have been able to \nretain his employment after his security clearance was called into question. The \ncompany\u2019s CEO lauds his dedication, commitment to duty, high moral and ethical \nvalues, and strong loyalty. Because Applicant chose to have this matter handled \nadministratively, I am unable to evaluate his demeanor, appearance, or form a positive \ndetermination as to his truthfulness. \n\n10 \n \n \n \nThe evidence against approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial. His \ndecision to possess and use marijuana while holding a security clearance was \nknowledgeable, voluntary, and intentional. He was sufficiently mature to be fully \nresponsible for his conduct. This offense shows a serious lack of judgment and a failure \nto abide by the law. His misconduct raises a serious security concern, and a security \nclearance is not warranted at this time. I am satisfied that if he continues to abstain from \ndrug use, and avoids future offenses he will eventually have future potential for access \nto classified information. \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d3 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not currently eligible for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, illegal drugs:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a- 1.e: \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, personal conduct:  AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R.

In the summer of 2003, he began falling behind in paying his credit accounts because he did not fully understand the implication of managing his credit and was spending more money than he earned. At the time, he was living with his parents, earning $9 per hour. (Item 5) Since May 2004, Applicant has been employed as a security officer for a defense contractor. He earns $21 per hour. In January 2009, he submitted his budget. He has a net monthly income of $2,600 and $1,110 in expenses. He pays $130 toward his obligations, including one of the SOR debts. He has $1,370 remaining at the end of the month for any additional obligations or expenses. (Item 6) Based on credit bureau reports (CBR) dated June 2008, March 2009 and May 2009, the SOR alleged two delinquent debts, totaling $12,574. (Items 7, 8, 9) Both debts are resolved: 1. SOR \u00b6 1.a lists a debt for $10,039 that is being resolved through a debt consolidation agreement, which Applicant executed on March 19, 2009.

On April 2, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nJune 29, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nOn April 10, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have \nthe case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On May 7, 2009, Department \nCounsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) containing nine Items, and mailed \nApplicant a complete copy the same day. Applicant received the FORM on May 15, \n2009, and had 30 days from its receipt to file objections and submit additional \ninformation. On June 4, 2009, Applicant submitted additional information. On June 17, \n2009, DOHA assigned the case to me. Department Counsel did not object to Applicant\u2019s \nsubmission and I marked his exhibit as AE 1 and admitted it into the record. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations contained in \nthe SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b.  \n  \n \nApplicant is 31 years old and single. In the summer of 2003, he began falling \nbehind in paying his credit accounts because he did not fully understand the implication \nof managing his credit and was spending more money than he earned. At the time, he \nwas living with his parents, earning $9 per hour. (Item 5)  \n \n \nSince May 2004, Applicant has been employed as a security officer for a defense \ncontractor. He earns $21 per hour. In January 2009, he submitted his budget. He has a \nnet monthly income of $2,600 and $1,110 in expenses. He pays $130 toward his \nobligations, including one of the SOR debts. He has $1,370 remaining at the end of the \nmonth for any additional obligations or expenses. (Item 6) \n \n \nBased on credit bureau reports (CBR) dated June 2008, March 2009 and May \n2009, the SOR alleged two delinquent debts, totaling $12,574. (Items 7, 8, 9) Both \ndebts are resolved: \n \n1. SOR \u00b6 1.a lists a debt for $10,039 that is being resolved through a debt \nconsolidation agreement, which Applicant executed on March 19, 2009. He \nmade his first monthly payment of $314 on April 3, 2009, as agreed. (Item 3; \nAE 1 at 2) \n \n2. SOR \u00b6 1.b lists a debt for $2,535 owed on a personal loan. That debt was \ntransferred to another collection agency. As of October 2008, the balance \nwas $1,671, as Applicant has made three $100 payments on the bill. As of \nMay 20, 2009, the bill is current. (Item 3 at 4; AE 1 at 3)  \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. According to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant \nis responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has \nthe ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions adverse to an \napplicant shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \n The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19, three of them are potentially disqualifying:  \n \n(a) an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the \nabsence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or \nestablish a realistic plan to pay the debt; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nBased on three CBRs and his admissions, Applicant accumulated debts that he \nwas previously unable or unwilling to satisfy debts that began accruing in 2003 because \nof overspending and poor financial management. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthese three disqualifying conditions.  \n \nAfter the Government raised potential disqualifications, the burden shifted to \nApplicant to rebut and prove mitigation of the resulting security concerns. The guideline \nincludes six examples of conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \nfinancial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies have been ongoing since 2003, and did not \narise out of unusual circumstance, but rather overspending and financial \nmismanagement. Hence, AG \u00b6 2 (a) and AG & 20(b) do not apply. Applicant presented \nevidence that he received credit counseling and established a repayment plan for the \ndebt contained in SOR \u00b6 1.a, and, he is making monthly payments on the debt listed \nSOR \u00b6 1. b. Hence, he made a good-faith effort to resolve both debts, which are now \nunder control, triggering the application of AG & 20(c) and AG & 20(d). There is no \nevidence to support the application of AG & 20(e) or AG & 20(f).  \n  \n Whole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 31-years old and has \nworked for a federal contractor since May 2004. He candidly admitted that he \naccumulated delinquent debts starting in 2003 and takes responsibility for his \nobligations. In October 2008, he began resolving one of the debts and in March 2009, \nhe began resolving the other. He took those steps to manage his debts prior to the \nissuance of the April 2009 SOR. According to his budget, he has sufficient money to \npay both debts. Based on his awareness of the effect that financial delinquencies could \nhave on his employment and his actions to resolve the delinquent obligations, I do not \nbelieve similar problems will recur in the future.  Overall, the record evidence leaves me \n\n \n6 \n \n \nwithout doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his \nfinancial issues.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

The record does not contain sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the security concerns stemming from his history of financial problems.\nAccordingly, as explained in further detail below, this case is decided against Applicant. \nAugust 12, 2009\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\ndated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive). In addition to the Executive\nOrder and Directive, this case is adjudicated under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining\nEligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December\n29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective September 1,\n2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all\nadjudications and other determinations where an SOR has been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.\nThe Directive is pending revision or amendment. \n The government\u2019s brief includes several attachments referred to as items. They are referred to as exhibits\n2\nherein. \n2\nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense\n1\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to\nApplicant on March 18, 2009. The SOR is equivalent to a complaint and it details the\nfactual basis for the action. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F for\nfinancial considerations, and it recommended submitting Applicant\u2019s case to an\nadministrative judge for a determination to deny or revoke a security clearance.  \nApplicant replied to the SOR on April 6, 2009, and he did not a request a hearing.\nAccordingly, the case will be decided based on the written record in lieu of a hearing.\nOn April 23, 2009, the government submitted its written case consisting of all\nrelevant and material information that could be adduced at a hearing. This so-called file\nof relevant material (FORM)  was mailed to Applicant and received by him on May 21,\n2\n2009. He did not respond within the allowed 30-day period. The case was assigned to\nme on August 3, 2009. \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged eight delinquent debts ranging from $47 to\n$10,305 for a total of approximately $26,105; three appear to be student loans for more\nthan $20,000. His Answer to the SOR was mixed. He admitted the debts except for\nthose alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.g, which he denied. And he denied SOR \u00b6 1.h,\nsuggesting this student loan duplicated the student loans in \u00b6\u00b6 1.e. and 1.f. He did not\nsubmit any attachments or enclosures to his Answer. His admissions are incorporated\nherein as findings of fact. Based on the record as a whole, the following facts are\nestablished by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He completed a\nsecurity-clearance application in May 2008 (Exhibit 4). It appears that he is seeking a\nsecurity clearance for the first time (Exhibit 4 at p. 17). \nHis security-clearance application shows a sporadic employment history (Exhibit\n4 at pp. 9\u201312). He has worked in his current job as a material handler since April 2008.\n\n3\nBut he has had several periods of unemployment as follows: (1) from October 2007 to\nApril 2008; (2) from August 2006 to April 2007; (3) from January 2005 to September\n2005; and (4) from March 2001 to January 2003.\nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems is established by information contained\nin credit reports, to include a credit report Applicant submitted in response to written\ninterrogatories (Exhibits 5 and 7). Applicant attributes his financial problems to\nunemployment and garnishments for child-support payments (Exhibit 6 at p. 4). The\nindividual debts, as alleged in the SOR, are addressed below.  \nApplicant admits an unpaid $47 collection account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. It is also\nestablished by Applicant\u2019s credit report, which shows it was past due as of August 2008\n(Exhibit 7 at p. 6). \nApplicant admits an unpaid $305 judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. It stems from\nunpaid rent when he was unemployed (Exhibit 6 at p. 3). \nApplicant denies an unpaid $1,251 collection account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. Both\ncredit reports describe this account as a paid, closed collection account (Exhibits 5 and\n7).\nApplicant denies an unpaid $162 collection account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. It is\nestablished by Applicant\u2019s credit report, which shows it was past due as of June 2008\n(Exhibit 7 at p. 7).   \nApplicant admits an unpaid $4,546 student loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. It appears\nto be a federal student loan that went into default. Applicant\u2019s credit report shows it went\ninto collection as of February 2007, and was $4,546 past due as of October 2008\n(Exhibit 7 at p. 8).\nApplicant admits an unpaid $7,391 student loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f. It appears\nto be a federal student loan that went into default. Applicant\u2019s credit report shows it went\ninto collection as of February 2007, and it was $7,391 past due as of October 2008\nExhibit 7 at p. 8).   \nApplicant denies an unpaid $2,098 collection account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g.\nApplicant indicated, in a personal financial statement, that he is disputing this debt\n(Exhibit 7 at p. 4). It is not established by the credit reports. The government\u2019s credit\nreport shows no balance on this account (Exhibit 5 at p. 4). Applicant\u2019s credit report\nshows no balance as well (Exhibit 7 at p. 7). \nApplicant denies an unpaid $10,305 student loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h, because\nhe believes it is not a separate debt and duplicates the student loans in \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f.\nThe government\u2019s credit report shows no balance on this account and describes it as\nclosed (Exhibit 5 at p. 4). Applicant\u2019s credit report shows a balance of $0 as of October\n2006 (Exhibit 7 at pp. 8\u20139).\n\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n3\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n4\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n5\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain\nth\nthat there is no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases\nsuch as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n 484 U.S. at 531.\n6\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n7\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n8\n4\nFor the student loans, Applicant indicates he is making $130 monthly payments,\nbut time did not permit him to obtain a record of payments or an account statement\n(Exhibit 7 at pp. 3 and 4). \nIn addition to the derogatory information, Applicant\u2019s credit report shows a\nstudent loan account in good standing (Exhibit 7 at p. 9). The account was opened in\n1996, had a high credit limit or original amount of $6,897, and the status is described as\npaid, closed, and never late. \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, the only purpose of a security clearance\ndecision is to decide if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information.\nA favorable decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted a security\nclearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An unfavorable\n3\ndecision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security clearance, and (3)\nprevents access to classified information at any level.  \n4\nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n5\nnoted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy V. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive,\n6\nany doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n7\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n8\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\n\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n11\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 13\u201314 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n14\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at p. 13. \n15\n5\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n9\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n10\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.11\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a commonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant\nand material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-\nperson concept. \nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to have a high degree\nof trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified\ninformation. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met\n13\nthe strict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security\nclearance.\nAnalysis\n1.\nThe record does not contain sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems. \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically\n14\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\n15\n\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n16\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n17\n6\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and\nsafeguarding classified information.   \nThe record contains substantial evidence to establish five of the eight delinquent\ndebts alleged in the SOR. But three debts are found in Applicant\u2019s favor. The unpaid\n$1,215 collection account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c is paid; the unpaid $2,098 collection\naccount in \u00b6 1.g is not established by the credit reports; and the unpaid $10,305 student\nloan in \u00b6 1.h is not established as a separate account that Applicant currently owes. The\nother five debts, to include two student loans, amount to $12,451 in delinquent debt,\nwhich supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial problems. His\nhistory of financial problems raises security concerns because it indicates inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within\n16\n17\nthe meaning of Guideline F. The record evidence is more than sufficient to establish\nthese two disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also provides that certain conditions may mitigate security\nconcerns:\nMC 1\u2013the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\nMC 2\u2013the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\nMC 3\u2013the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\nMC 4\u2013the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts;\nMC 5\u2013the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; or \nMC 6\u2013the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.\n \n\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 1\u20132. \n18\n7\nAll the mitigating conditions have been considered and the most pertinent here is\nMC 2, due to Applicant\u2019s four periods of unemployment. MC 2 does not apply, however,\nbecause the record does not contain sufficient evidence to show if he acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances. This mitigating condition, like the others, does not apply in his\nfavor. \nIn summary, Applicant has more than $12,000 in delinquent debt. He did not\nsubmit adequate documentation to show that (1) he has a realistic plan to address his\nfinancial problems and (2) he has taken significant actions to implement the plan. The\nstudent loans are particularly troubling, given the nature of the debt and the relative\nease that documentation (repayment agreements, account statements, etc.) should be\navailable from the creditor. \n2.\nThe whole-person concept does not support a favorable decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate a\nperson\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the person\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine\nfactors listed in the Revised Guidelines as follows: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.  \n18\nAfter weighing the record as a whole and giving it due consideration under the\nnine-part whole-person concept, I conclude that Applicant did not present sufficient\nevidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. Given the available\ninformation, it is simply too soon to tell if Applicant will be able to put his financial house\nin good order. Applicant\u2019s evidence is not  sufficient to overcome the security concerns.\nApplicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\ndecision. This case is decided against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by\nsection E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nSubparagraphs 1.d\u20131.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.g\u20131.h:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of\nnational security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his RSOR, Applicant admitted SOR allegations: 1.a. through 1.g., and 1.i. through 1.k. He denied 1.h. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including Applicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: Applicant is 51 years old. He is currently unmarried, but he was previously married, and he has one son. At the time of the hearing, Applicant was employed as a Quality Analyst by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector. The SOR lists 11 allegations (1.a. through 1.k.) regarding financial difficulties under Adjudicative Guideline F, for overdue debts totaling $265,645. The debts will be discussed in the same order as they were listed in the SOR: 1.a. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $229. Applicant testified that he plans to contact this creditor and work out a payment arrangement. However, at the time of the hearing, this debt has not been paid or reduced (Tr at 36- 37). 1.b.

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nMarch 9, 2010\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nOn June 30, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F  for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn July 22, 2009, Applicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing, and requested\na hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on August\n26, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on September 17, 2009, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on October 15, 2009, in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Government\noffered Exhibits 1 through 7, which were received without objection. Applicant testified\non his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through H, at the time of hearing, which\nwere also admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr)\non October 30, 2009. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until\n\n2\nOctober 29, 2009, to submit additional documents. He timely submitted two additional\ndocuments, which have been identified and entered into evidence collectively as Exhibit\nI. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR, Applicant admitted SOR allegations: 1.a. through 1.g., and 1.i.\nthrough 1.k. He denied 1.h. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings\nof fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon\ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 51 years old. He is currently unmarried, but he was previously\nmarried, and he has one son. At the time of the hearing, Applicant was employed as a\nQuality Analyst by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security clearance in\nconnection with his employment in the defense sector.\nThe SOR lists 11 allegations (1.a. through 1.k.) regarding financial difficulties\nunder Adjudicative Guideline F, for overdue debts totaling $265,645. The debts will be\ndiscussed in the same order as they were listed in the SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $229. Applicant\ntestified that he plans to contact this creditor and work out a payment arrangement.\nHowever, at the time of the hearing, this debt has not been paid or reduced (Tr at 36-\n37).\n1.b. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $185,000. Applicant\ntestified that, as of three months before the hearing, he has become current on this debt\nfor the mortgage on his home (Tr at 37-39). Exhibit I includes the monthly mortgage\nstatement on this debt, which establishes that Applicant still owes $180,865, but he is\ncurrent on this debt, and he is paying $1,325.16 a month. Applicant testified that this\nhouse had been in foreclosure on two previous occasions because of his failure to pay\nthe mortgage (Tr at 57). \n1.c. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,157. Applicant\ntestified that he plans to contact the creditor for this credit card debt and work out a\npayment arrangement. However, at this time, this debt has not been paid or reduced (Tr\nat 39).\n1.d. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $17,000. Applicant\ntestified that a judgement has been entered against him on this credit card debt.  At this\ntime, this debt has not been paid or reduced (Tr at 39-42).\n\n3\n1.e. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $5,553.  Applicant\ntestified that a judgement is in the process of being entered against him on this credit\ncard debt.  At this time, this debt has not been paid or reduced (Tr at 42).\n1.f. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $3,014.  Applicant\ntestified that he plans to contact the creditor for this credit card debt for the purchase of\na computer and equipment to work out a payment arrangement. However, at the time of\nthe hearing, this debt had not been paid or reduced (Tr at 42-43).\n1.g. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $13,000.  Applicant\ntestified that this debt is for a car that he purchased. He had allowed his former girlfriend\nto use it, and although he now has possession of the vehicle, he has not returned it to\nthe creditor to potentially reduce the size of the debt. This debt has not been paid or\nreduced (Tr at 43-46).\n1.h. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $13,000. As stated\nabove, Applicant denied this allegation in his RSOR. At the hearing, he stated that he is\npaying $100 a month on this debt for more than one year  (Tr at 46-47). Exhibit I\nincludes receipts showing that Applicant has made one payment of $75 and 10\npayments of $100 on this debt, from October 2008 through September 2009. The\nreceipts do not show how much is still owed on this debt. \n1.i. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $692.  Applicant\ntestified that he plans to contact the creditor for this credit card debt and work out a\npayment arrangement. However, at this time, this debt has not been paid or reduced (Tr\nat 47).\n1.j. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $11,000.  Applicant\ntestified that this credit card debt has not been paid or reduced (Tr at 48-50).\n1.k. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $16,000.  Applicant\ntestified that this credit card debt has not been paid or reduced (Tr at 48-50).\nApplicant testified that his financial difficulties occurred as a result of entering into\na business arrangement with his girlfriend at the time of the business arrangement, in\nwhich he loaned her money as a business investment in five different business projects,\nincluding purchasing and reselling houses, securing mortgage loans, advertising and\nreestablishing credit. He alleged that she used the money for a number of purposes\nother than the businesses. He continued to loan her money after they broke up and\ndespite the fact that the businesses did not seem to be successful. He stated that he\nultimately plans to pursue in court any assets that she may have, although he conceded\nthat he does not know what, if anything, he might recover (Tr at 51-54). \nApplicant also explained that much of his credit card debt was used to purchase\ndown payments on two houses that he purchased with his girlfriend, and to make\npayments on them while she was refurbishing them (Tr at 60-61). Applicant did not have\n\n4\nan estimate as to the amount of money that he invested in the businesses with his\ngirlfriend. \nMitigation\nApplicant submitted two positive character letters in Exhibits B and C. The first\nletter was from his supervisor, dated October 13, 2009, which stated that \u201cI consider\n[Applicant] a highly responsible co-worker who initiated several financial endeavors that\ndid not turn out well . . . But he has worked diligently to correct those siruations.\u201d  The\nsecond letter, from a Vice President of his employer stated, \u201cI believe [Appellant] has\ndisplayed sound integrity and ethical behavior in doing his job and protecting sensitive\ninformation.\u201d\nApplicant also submitted Performance Appraisals for years 2003, 2004, 2005,\n2008 and 2009 (Exhibits D through H). They were all quite positive, and in years 2008\nand 2009, his overall score was a 4.0 out of 5.0.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \n\n5\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\n           The trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations\nis set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.\nUnder AG \u00b6 19 (a), \u201can inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially\ndisqualifying. Similarly, under AG \u00b6 19 (c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d\nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt and has\nbeen unable to pay or resolve most of his obligations for several years. The evidence is\nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns from financial\ndifficulties:\nUnder AG \u00b6  20 (b), \u201cit may be mitigating where the conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d As noted above,\nApplicant testified that his financial problems resulted from his investments in the\nbusinesses with his former girlfriend. However, the evidence is clear that he made\nextremely poor business choices by continuing to borrow on his credit cards to make\n\n6\nadditional investments in the businesses. Also, since he has not repaid or resolved a\nsignificant amount of his considerable overdue debt, I can not find that he has acted\nresponsibly.  Therefore, I do not find that this potentially mitigating condition is a factor\nfor consideration in this case. \n Applicant has not resolved much of his overdue debt. I conclude that until he is\nable to significantly reduce this overdue debt, and show that he can maintain a more\nstable financial picture, he has not mitigated the financial concerns of the Government.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited\nabove as to why the Disqualifying Conditions apply and why no Mitigating Condition\napplies, I find that the record evidence leaves me with significant questions and doubts\nas to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance under the whole person\nconcept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security\nconcerns. \nFormal Findings\n           Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.k.:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\n          In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On June 5, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992,\nas amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On November 24, 2009, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Roger C. Wesley denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\nApplicant\u2019s statement regarding family support is new evidence, which the Board cannot consider on appeal.\n1\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision.\nThe Judge made the following relevant findings of fact: Applicant consumed alcohol at a\nlight to moderate rate between 1975 and 1989.  Following a 1983 conviction for driving under the\ninfluence of alcohol (DUI), Applicant attended 20 Alcoholics Anonymous meetings on the orders\nof a court, but has attended none since.  Applicant\u2019s drinking increased between 1989 and 1994, in\npart to mitigate the effects of a depression problem.  Applicant then decreased his drinking,\nabstaining completely between 1995 and 1997.  Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption increased\ndramatically in 2000.  For the next four years, Applicant drove monthly or bi-monthly on weekends\nto a gambling metropolis, where he would see exhibits, attend concerts, gamble, and drink alcohol.\nApplicant was arrested and fined for DUI in October 1983, September 1993, October 2004, and\nDecember 2004.  Applicant has had no further DUI arrests.  He continues to drink, but less than\nbefore.\nApplicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in December 2006.  Applicant had previously\nmaintained good credit.  When Applicant traveled to gamble on weekends, he did not believe that\nhe was gambling with money he needed for monthly expenses, but later realized that was the case.\nBetween 2001 and 2006, Applicant spent about $20,000 on gambling vacations.  Applicant now\nmaintains all his accounts in a current state, gambling only occasionally and only with money not\nneeded to pay bills.  Applicant is praised by his supervisor for his strong work ethic. \nOn appeal, Applicant points out two pieces of evidence which indicate that he has no further\nneed of treatment or counseling for his consumption of alcohol.  Applicant also restates his\ntestimony that he appreciates that alcohol use can and does cause problems.  He repeats that he\nconsumes alcohol only rarely and has not abused alcohol since December 2004.   That was\n1\nmitigating evidence for the Judge to consider, and there is a rebuttable presumption that the Judge\nconsidered it unless he specifically stated otherwise.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-16240 at 2 (App.\nBd. Oct. 1, 2008).  However, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the\nJudge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh\nthe evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable\nevidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an\nability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the\nJudge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-10454 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 12, 2008). \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AGs) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued\nafter September 1, 2006.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on June 26, 2009, and requested a hearing.  The\ncase was assigned to me on July 21, 2009, and was scheduled for hearing on August\n19, 2009.  A hearing was held on the scheduled date for the purpose of considering\nwhether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny,\nNovember 24, 2009\n\n2\nor revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance. At the hearing, the government's case\nconsisted of nine exhibits; Applicant relied on two witnesses (including himself) and three\nexhibits.  The transcript (Tr.) was received on August 27, 2009.  Based upon a review of\nthe case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access classified\ninformation is denied.\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline G, Applicant is alleged to have been arrested on four different\noccasions for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI): (a) in December 2004, for\nwhich he was fined $576 and ordered to serve 48 hours of community service; (b) in\nOctober 2004, for which he was fined $577 and ordered to serve 48 hours of community\nservice; (c) in September 1993, for which he was fined $910, and ordered to serve 48\nhours of community service; and (d) in October 1983, for which he was fined an\nunidentified amount.\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have (a) petitioned for Chapter 7\nbankruptcy protection in December 2006 (discharged in April 2007), (b) accumulated\n$20,000 in gambling debts over a five-year period; and (c) continues to gamble. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant denied most of the alcohol-related\nallegations covered by Guideline G; he admitted only the allegations in subparagraph\n1.d. He admitted to petitioning for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in December 2006 and\ncontinuing to gamble. He denied losing $20,000 in gambling debts over a five-year\nperiod.  Applicant provided no explanations for his answers.         \n      \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is 53-year old material coordinator for a defense contractor who seeks a\nsecurity clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are\nadopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant had a short marriage: He married in October 1987 and divorced his wife\nin June 1989.  He has no children.  He has no military experience and no identified\nschooling beyond high school (see ex. 1).\nApplicant was introduced to alcohol at the age of 16 (Tr. 90).  He did not like it and\ndid not resume drinking until he was 21 years of age (Tr. 90).  Applicant continued to\ndrink at a light to moderate rate between 1975 and 1989 (see exs. 2 and 8). He attended\nabout 20 Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings on the orders of the court that sentenced\nhim following his 1983 DUI conviction, but none thereafter (Tr. 91).  \nBetween 1989 and 1994, he increased his drinking considerably: to the point of\nintoxication three to four times a year (Tr. 90).  During this period, he often drank to\nmitigate the effects of his depression problem. (Tr. 92, 102).  He was counseled an\ntreated by a psychiatrist for a minor depression problem from October 1995 to November\n\n3\n2008 (see ex. 2). After his medical provider advised him not to continue drinking in\nconjunction with the anti-depressant medication (Prozac) he was taking for his\ndiagnosed Dysthymic Disorder (Tr. 65, 93), he reduced his alcohol consumption (Tr. 94).\nFor the ensuing seven years (between 1993 and 2000), he drank very little, and even\nabstained completely for a brief period between 1995 and 1997 (Tr. 116).\n After his mother passed away in 1997, though, he resumed his drinking,\nsometimes with his brother in social settings (Tr. 94, 117).  Applicant realizes he should\nnot be drinking with his brother, but still spends time with him. Just two weeks ago at\ntheir father\u2019s home, he consumed two beers in his brother\u2019s presence (Tr. 94, 117-18).\nAlthough Applicant does not consume alcohol as frequently as he used to, he continues\nto drink occasionally and shows no disposition for abstaining in the future (Tr. 94-95).\nTypically, when he drinks, he consumes only beer and limits his intake to a few beers\n(Tr. 94-95).  \nOnce he returned to drinking in 2000, his alcohol consumption increased\ndramatically. Sometimes he drank to intoxication.  Once a month, sometimes bi-monthly,\nhe drove to a large gambling metropolis south of his place of residence to spend\nweekends seeing exhibits, attending concerts, and gambling casinos. On these\noccasions, he typically consumed large amounts of alcohol: usually seven to eight beers\nover a five-hour period. Applicant maintained this travel practice for over four years,\nbefore cutting back to the occasional drinking he currently practices. \nBetween October 1983 and December 2004, Applicant was involved in four\nalcohol-related incidents.  He was arrested and fined for all four of his alcohol-related\narrests: in October 1983, in September 1993, in October 2004, and in December 2004\n(see exs. 2 through 8; Tr. 63.  In each instance (save for his 1983 conviction), he was\nfined and court-ordered to serve 48 hours of community service (see exs. 2 and 8). His\narrest records covering his 1993 DUI note that Applicant recorded a .199 per cent blood\nalcohol consumption rate after telling the arresting officer he had consumed two to three\nbeers (see exs. 4 and 5).  Besides the four incidents for which he was arrested and\nconvicted, he is certain there were other occasions when he consumed alcohol before he\ndrove his vehicle (Tr. 89).\nOver a 10-year period between 1995 and 2006, Applicant often took gambling\nvacations to a large gaming metropolis in his state (Tr. 97-98).  On these trips, usually\nonce a month, he typically attended exhibits, concerts, and gambling casinos, and often\nconsumed alcohol to the point of intoxication (Tr. 98-99). When attending outdoor\nconcerts, he typically consumed seven to eight beers over a five to six hour period ex. 2;\n(Tr. 99-100).\nApplicant entered guilty pleas in connection with the DUI charges filed in\nconnection with both his October and December 2004 arrests.  The court consolidated\nthe cases and assigned a single case number (see exs. 2 and 3).  When Applicant\nappeared on both cases in August 2006, the court accepted his guilty pleas. In its\nsentencing order, the court required Applicant to complete an online alcohol-related\n\n4\ndriving course (Tr. 66).  The court also required him to obtain an evaluation from a local\nalcohol counselor (Tr. 67, 87, 104-09, 112).  He is not familiar with her credentials, but\nbelieves she was a licensed substance abuse counselor (see ex. 2; Tr. 105).  While she\ndid not indicate he had an alcohol problem, she did not share any report with him (Tr.\n104-15).  She advised him to consult his physician about combining his prescribed\nProzac medications with alcohol.  Applicant complied with her instructions (Tr. 67, 96-\n97).  \nFollowing Applicant\u2019s two convictions resulting from his 2004 DUI arrests, the\ncourt directed Applicant to seek an alcohol-related evaluation.  By all accounts, Applicant\ncomplied with the terms of the sentences imposed on him in connection with each of his\nconvictions (Tr. 86).  Since his last DUI offense in 2004, Applicant has not been involved\nin any other alcohol-related incident. \nApplicant has alcohol issues within his family. His brother is an alcoholic (Tr. 64).\nConsequently, when Applicant visits his brother, he seldom longer consumes alcohol in\nhis presence (see ex. 2; Tr. 64).  Besides his brother, Applicant had a grandfather who\nwas an alcoholic before he passed away (Tr. 64).  He also had a close friend who\nbelieved to be an alcoholic.  Applicant finds it hard to deal with either of them, and tries\nto avoid them as much as possible (Tr.  118-19).\nSince his last DUI conviction, Applicant continues to consume alcohol, but less\nfrequently.  After completing his 20 court-directed Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings\nin 1983, he ceased attending AA events altogether, and has never resumed his AA\nparticipation. \nAt home, Applicant has little social life and considers himself an infrequent\ndrinker.  He has no family support system, though, and no AA or other support network\nto help him maintain his sobriety. The court-referred counselor who evaluated him\nfollowing his 2004 DUI convictions never shared her report with him or provided him a\ncopy of the same (Tr. 104-07).  And Applicant has never referred himself for diagnosis by\na certified physician or licensed substance abuse counselor (Tr. 102).  So, at this time, it\nis still unclear whether (a) Applicant has any alcohol-related disorder (inclusive of\ndependence or abuse) or (b) if he does, it is medically advisable for him to continue to\nconsume alcohol in the face of his alcohol drinking and family history.   \nApplicant\u2019s finances\nBefore filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief in December 2006 (see ex. 2),\nApplicant maintained reasonably good credit (Tr. 75).  Periodically, he traveled south to a\nlarge metropolis to gamble, a favorite pastime of Applicant\u2019s. He characterized his\ngambling as social gambling that he did not think (at the time) involved the use of income\nsources needed to pay his domestic bills (Tr. 77). He now realizes that \u201che must have\ngambled with money that went to pay bills,\u201d based on his understanding of the contents\nof his Chapter 7 bankruptcy schedules (Tr. 77). \n\n5\nBetween 2001 and 2006, he estimates he spent about $20,000 on his gambling\nvacations before filing for bankruptcy in late 2006 (Tr. 71-74).  Black jack was his\nprincipal game of choice, and he sometimes lost as much as $500 in an evening of\ngambling (Tr. 77, 97). He typically used his credit cards to finance his gambling\nendeavors (ex. 2). \nPrior to filing for Chapter 7 relief, Applicant talked to several of his credit card\ncreditors about lowering his debt payments, but to no avail (Tr.68).  When he was late on\none of his credit card payments, the creditor raised the interest rate on his account to 30\nper cent (Tr. 68-69).  He could not make the increased payments with the interest rate\nchanges and elected to file for bankruptcy (see ex. 2; Tr. 69).  Besides talking to debt\nconsolidation companies and his credit card creditors, Applicant also completed the\ncourt\u2019s required financial counseling (Tr. 68).  \nIn his 2007 bankruptcy petition, Applicant scheduled $63,736 in unscheduled\nclaims (mostly credit card accounts) and $6,200 worth of secured claims (see ex. 2; Tr.\n73).  His listed assets included a secured mobile home worth $5,000 and personal\nproperty valued at $33,678 (see ex.2). Applicant claimed all of this property to be exempt\nfrom creditor claims (see ex. 2).  \nApplicant received his bankruptcy discharge in April 2007.  By all accounts, his\nclaimed exemptions were honored, and nothing was left of his estate for distribution to\nhis creditors.  As such, Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy is classified as an essentially no-asset\ncase.\nSince his bankruptcy discharge, Applicant has been able to maintain all of his\naccounts in a current state (see exs. C through E; Tr. 70-72).  His net monthly income is\napproximately $2,000 a month (see ex. 2; Tr. 78-79).  He monthly expenses cover his\nrent ($300), food ($400 to $500), car insurance ($105), gas for his vehicle ($50), utilities\n($400 plus), and recreation ($80).  He has no written budget but tries to keep track of his\nexpenditures (Tr. 80).  Applicant has few assets: a vehicle, about $600 in his checking\naccount, and some $3,000 stuffed under his bed for emergencies (Tr. 81).  His 401(k)\nretirement plan has about a $12,000 balance at the present time (Tr. 77-78, 82-83).  He\nowns a 2003 vehicle that is paid off (see ex. B).  While he continues to gamble some in\nhis home town, he no longer takes weekend gambling trips and gambles only with extra\ndollars not needed to pay his bills (Tr. 77). Applicant is corroborated by his credit reports,\nwhich show all of his accounts to be in current status (see exs. C through E).\nEndorsements\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor (who is also the firm\u2019s company manager) has known\nApplicant for 20 years (Tr. 48-49).  This supervisor knows Applicant professionally and\nsocially, sees him two to three times a week, and characterizes him as loyal,\nresponsible, and trustworthy (Tr. 51-53).  He credits Applicant with a very strong work\nethic (Tr. 59).  Applicant\u2019s employment credits include numerous training certificates (see\nex. F).\n\n6\nPolicies\nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making\nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could\ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as considerations\nthat could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation. These guidelines include \"[c]onditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying\u201d (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of the \"[c]onditions\nthat could mitigate security concerns,\u201d if any. These guidelines must be considered\nbefore deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued, or\ndenied.  Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive reliance on the\nenumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a\ndecision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent\nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs,\nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense\ndecision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context\nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period\nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the\napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct: (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual\nguidelines are pertinent herein:\nAlcohol Consumption\nThe Concern: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the\nexercise of questionable judgment, or the failure to control impulses, and\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\nSee AG \u00b6 21.\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\n\n7\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial\ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known\nsources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds\nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. AG \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the revised AGs, a decision to\ngrant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold\nfinding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive\nrequires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence\naccumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence. See Kungys v. United States, 485 U.S. 759, 792-800 (1988).  As with all\nadversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences which have a\nreasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the judge cannot\ndraw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that the\nfacts proven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not require the\nGovernment to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or\nabused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather,\nconsideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation, or\nmitigation.  Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security clearances be\nclearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating his clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,\n531 (1988). \nAnalysis\nApplicant is a highly regarded employee of a defense contractor with a history of\nrecurrent alcohol-related arrests (four in all over a 20-year period spanning 1983 and\n2004) and admitted other instances of abusive alcohol consumption over the same\nperiod. Applicant\u2019s exhibited alcohol abuse raises security concerns covered by\n\n8\nGuideline G of the Adjudicative Guidelines.  Applicant\u2019s accumulated delinquent debts\nassociated with credit card accounts (some used to finance his gambling endeavors)\ncontributed to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2007. Applicant\u2019s finances raise security\nconcerns, too, under Guideline F.    \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol issues\nApplicant\u2019s four alcohol-related arrests covered in the SOR raise major concerns\nover his risk of recurrent alcohol abuse.  On the strength of the evidence presented, two\ndisqualifying conditions (DC) of the Adjudication Guidelines for alcohol consumption (AG\n\u00b6 21) may be applied: 22(a), \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving\nwhile under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace or other\nincidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent,\u201d and \u00b6 22(c), \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to\nthe point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an\nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d\nDespite the recurrent pattern of his alcohol-related arrests (four over a 20-year\nperiod), Applicant does not believe he is alcoholic and assures he has reduced his\ndrinking to occasional consumption since his last DUI conviction in 2004.  He has alcohol\naddiction in his family, however, and a recurrent history of alcohol-related incidents.  He\nalso reports some history of depression issues requiring medications. Advised by his\ntreating mental health provider that these medications could, when used concurrently\nwith alcohol, exacerbate his condition, he elected to cease taking his medications\naltogether. Family history, recurrent alcohol-related convictions, and continued drinking\ndespite knowledge of a recurrent psychological problem are cited indicators of a\nsubstance-dependence problem. See Diagnostic Statistical Manual-IV (4  ed) (DSM-IV). \nth\nWhether Applicant has an alcohol disorder covered by the DSM-IV cannot be\nfirmly established without a documented professional evaluation by a credentialed\nphysician or licensed substance abuse counselor. In the absence of an updated\nprofessional evaluation, Applicant\u2019s status and needs cannot be reasonably determined.\nFrom what is known from the proofs, he has never sought an evaluation from a\ncredentialed physician or licensed substance abuse counselor, and has not attended any\nmeetings with AA or other recognized support system since the 1980s.\nApplicant\u2019s failure to provide any professional evaluations or documented  support\nof his reduced drinking during the past four plus years are important considerations in\ndetermining what weight to assign to Applicant\u2019s rehabilitation claims.  See ISCR Case\n02-03186 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2006); ISCR Case 01-20579, at 5 (App. Bd. Apr. 14, 2004). \nStill troubling and of ongoing security concern is Applicant\u2019s history of recurrent\nrelapses following periods of light to moderate alcohol consumption, and his lack of any\nextended period of sustained abstinence.  While Applicant provides assurances of his\nsincere commitment this time to maintain his current track of occasional drinking, he\n\n9\nprovides no professional evaluations on which to assess the adequacy of his reduced\nalcohol consumption in managing his sobriety.\nWith a family history of alcohol dependence, a recurrent pattern of alcohol-related\nincidents over a 20-year period, and a medical condition that could be exacerbated by\nany concurrent use of alcohol with his prescribed medications, it is still too soon to make\nsafe predictions that Applicant is at no foreseeable risk to a recurrent alcohol-related\nincident or episode.  Although he has been able to avoid any more alcohol-related\narrests since his last arrest and conviction in 2004, he continues to drink without a clean\nbill of health from a physician or licensed substance abuse provider. Under these special\ncircumstances, MC \u00b6 23(a), \u201cso much time has passed, or the behavior was so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment,\u201d has limited application. \nWithout proof of sustained abstinence, current participation in AA or other\ncredible support program, and/or a positive alcohol evaluation, none of the other\npotentially available mitigating conditions under the alcohol guideline are available to\nApplicant.  Passage of time without a recurrent incident, while important, is not enough to\nwarrant application of any of the other mitigating conditions without any demonstrated\nsatisfaction of the requirements imposed by these other mitigating conditions. \nFaced with similar recurrent alcohol-related arrests over a considerable period of\ntime, and the absence of any sustained abstinence, the Appeal Board has expressed\nreluctance to make safe, predictive judgments about an applicant\u2019s ability to avoid\nabusive incidents in the future without strong probative evidence of sustained recovery,\naided by positive professional reinforcements.  See ISCR Case No. 06-17541 (App. Bd.\nJan. 14, 2008); ISCR Case No. 04-10799 (App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2007); ISCR Case No. 05-\n16753 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2007).\nTaking into account both Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol abuse, his strong work\nrecord, the applicable guidelines and a whole person assessment of his most recent\nalcohol moderation efforts, conclusions warrant that his overall efforts, while\nencouraging, do not reflect sufficient  evidence of sustained commitment to a program\nthat provides optimum protections against recurrent alcohol abuse.  In the past, he has\nenjoyed considerable periods of abuse avoidance, only to return to abusive drinking that\ninvolved alcohol-related incidents away from work. Because of this recurrent abuse\nproblem, his earlier incidents cannot be considered isolated and unrelated to a pattern of\nabuse, despite their comparative age when considered separately.\nConsidering the record as a whole, Applicant fails to make a convincing showing\nthat he has the resource support at his disposal to avert any recurrent problems with\njudgment lapses related to alcohol.  Applicant\u2019s mitigation efforts are simply not enough\nat this time to warrant safe predictions that he is no longer at risk to judgment impairment\n\n10\nassociated with alcohol abuse. Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the\nallegations covered by the alcohol guideline of the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues\nApplicant\u2019s pleading admissions of his Chapter 7 bankruptcy and continued\ninvolvement in gambling activities (sometimes referred to as judicial admissions) negate\nthe need for any independent proof (see McCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 262 (6th ed. 2006).\nMoreover, Applicant\u2019s Chapter 7 bankruptcy schedules, which include defaulted credit\ncard accounts covering some $20,000 in pre-bankruptcy gambling debts, are fully\ndocumented in his latest credit reports and provide ample independent proof of his pre-\nbankruptcy debts.  Applicant\u2019s accumulation of gambling-related debts and their inclusion\nin his Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge warrant the application of two of the disqualifying\nconditions (DC) of the Guidelines: DC \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d\nDC \u00b619(c) \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d and DC \u00b6 19(f), \u201cfinancial\nproblems that are linked to drug abuse, alcoholism, gambling problems, or other issues\nof security concern.\u201d\nWith his limited repayment history and lengthy practice of using his monthly\nincome to fund his gambling endeavors instead of applying his marginal income sources\nto discharge his consumer bills that came due, Applicant\u2019s finances have not been very\nstable in recent years. While he has made some noticeable improvements in keeping his\naccounts current since receiving his Chapter 7 discharge in April 2007, his past gambling\nabuses do create some recurrence concerns.  \nApplicant\u2019s progress to date in regaining control of his finances is encouraging.\nHis efforts reflect positively on the lessons he has learned from his past mistakes in\nallocating his income sources.  His furnished estimates of his ability to continue to pay\nhis bills in a timely way and avoid any return to gambling except with excess funds are\ncredible, significant, and encouraging.  Based on his evidentiary showing, Applicant\u2019s\nproofs are sufficient to establish some extenuating circumstances associated with his\ndebt accumulations (i.e., unanticipated major increases in interest rates on carried\nbalances by some of his credit card issuers).  Of limited application is MC  \u00b6 20(b) of the\nfinancial considerations guideline, \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the behavior were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the individual\nacted responsibly.\u201d  Most of his accrued debts were controllable, though, and could likely\nhave been avoided without the compounding burdens of his  gambling debts. \nApplicant\u2019s current payment practices with his creditors since his 2007 bankruptcy\ndischarge entitle him to some mitigation credit under MC \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated\na good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d Although his\nbankruptcy was a no-asset case, he did initiate some prior efforts to work with his\ncreditors before ultimately settling on a bankruptcy strategy to resolve his accrued debts.\nHis bankruptcy petition and discharge cost him both time and money expended on\n\n11\nattorneys to process his bankruptcy petition to completion. His efforts, although very\nlimited, are encouraging. They are not enough, though, at this time to warrant full\napplication of any of the mitigating conditions covered in the financial guideline.  \nTo be sure, Applicant\u2019s gambling was significant and extended over a five-year\nperiod between 2001 and 2006.  His gambling expenditures over this time frame (around\n$20,000 by Applicant\u2019s estimations) were considerable and a principal contributor to his\n2006 bankruptcy petition.  Moreover, even if some of Applicant\u2019s debt delinquencies did\narise due to circumstances outside of his control, he could have been reasonably\nexpected to have exerted more responsible efforts in limiting his gambling activities that\nleft him with no viable options to petitioning for bankruptcy. \nHolding a security clearance involves a fiduciary relationship between the\nGovernment and the clearance holder. Quite apart from any agreement the clearance\nholder may have signed with the Government, the nature of the clearance holder\u2019s duties\nand access to classified information necessarily impose important duties of trust and\ncandor on the clearance holder that are considerably higher than those typically imposed\non government employees and contractors involved in other lines of government\nbusiness.  See Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507, 511 n.6 (1980). \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to access classified information is required\nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While the\nprincipal concern of a clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is\nvulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are explicit in\nfinancial cases.  Failure of the applicant to make concerted efforts to pay or resolve his\ndebts when able to do so raises security-significant concerns about the sufficiency of the\napplicant\u2019s demonstrated trust and judgment necessary to safeguard classified\ninformation.\nWhile no direct causal links were established in the record between Applicant\u2019s\ndrinking and gambling abuses, they do bear some relationship. His gambling trips\ntypically involved weekend excursions that included drinking and gambling. His gambling\ndebts accrued over a contemporaneous period that included his last two DUI incidents.\nRecurrent alcohol risks that remain with Applicant could pose some potential for\nApplicant\u2019s resumption of the gambling trips that caused him financial problems before\n2007. The potential overlap was never firmly stitched together, though, and Applicant\ncan credibly claim he is current with all of his bills since his bankruptcy discharge and in\nno danger of losing control of his finances.  \nWhole-person assessments enable Applicant to surmount the judgment questions\nraised by his accumulation of delinquent debts that were resolved by his Chapter 7\ndischarge in 2007.  His positive endorsement from his supervisor who he has known for\n20 years, and his credible showing that he is current in his bills all support his claims that\nhe has a firm control of his finances and is at no risk to delinquencies in the foreseeable\nfuture. \n\n12\nTaking into account all of the documented facts and circumstances surrounding\nApplicant\u2019s debt accumulations (inclusive of his major gambling debts) and resulting\n2007 bankruptcy, and his most recent efforts in managing his finances, Applicant\u2019s\nefforts to date are sufficient to make safe predictive judgments about his ability to\nmaintain control of his finances in the foreseeable future. \nOverall, clearance eligibility assessment of Applicant based on the information\navailable for consideration in this record enables him to establish judgment and trust\nlevels sufficient to overcome security concerns arising out of his accumulation of\ndelinquent debts.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered\nby subparagraphs 2a through 2.c.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the factors and conditions enumerated in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs.\nFormal Findings \nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate\nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE G (ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION):       AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 1.a through 1.d:\n               Against Applicant \nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): FOR APPLICANT\nSub-paras: 2a through 2.c:   \n    \n    For Applicant\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security\nclearance.

Jeffreys, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing  \n(e-QIP) on February 13, 2008. On February 3, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations; Guideline J, Criminal Conduct; \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement; and Guideline E, Personal Conduct, for Applicant. The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn February 16, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on March \n11, 2009. The case was assigned to me on March 20, 2009. On March 31, 2009, a \nNotice of Hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for April 22, 2009. The case was \nheard on that date. The Government offered six exhibits which were admitted as \nGovernment Exhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 6. Applicant testified and submitted no documents. The \nrecord was held open until May 6, 2009, to allow Applicant to submit additional \nJune 8, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \ndocuments. No additional documents were received. The transcript was received on \nMarch 7, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \n1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 2.a, 2.b, 2.c, 2.d, 2.e, 2.f, 3.a, 3.b and 3.c.  He denies the allegations in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.a and 4.b. \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old truck driver for a Department of Defense contractor. He \nhas been employed in his current position since September 2007. He is applying for a \nsecurity clearance for the first time. He has a general equivalency diploma (G.E.D.). He \nis divorced and has a grown daughter, age 26. (Tr at 4-6, 15; Gov 1)  \n \nOn February 13, 2008, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) in order to apply for a security clearance. Applicant \nanswered \u201cNo\u201d in response to section 23(a) Police Record \u201cHave you ever been \ncharged or convicted of any felony offense? (Include those under the Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice.) He did not list his arrest on August 24, 2000, for the charges of Out-of \nState Fugitive, and Forgery.  He also answered \u201cNo\u201d in response to section 24(a) Your \nUse of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity, \u201cSince the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, \nwhichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled substance, for example, \nmarijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, \nheroin, etc.), hallucinogens (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs?\u201d Applicant\u2019s \nsubsequent background investigation revealed he has used marijuana on a regular \nbasis from 1974 to January 1, 2004. He was required to disclose on his e-QIP \napplication any marijuana use within the past seven years, i.e. from February 13, 2001 \nto 2004. (Gov 1; Gov 3) \n \nApplicant admits to using marijuana on a daily basis for 30 years. He started \naround age 16 and stopped when he was 44. When he was using, he purchased \nmarijuana about every two weeks. He spent approximately $150 a month to purchase \nmarijuana during his last ten years of use.  He never used other drugs. He stopped \nusing marijuana in 2004. He testified that he did not list his marijuana use on his e-QIP \napplication because he forgot about it. He had no intent to deceive.  (Tr at 35-40; Gov 2 \nat 4; Gov 3 at 2, 7,12)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation revealed that Applicant has the following \ndelinquent accounts that were placed for collection: a $598 medical account (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a: Gov 3 at 15; Gov 5; Gov 6 at 5); a $475 medical account (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Gov 3 at 15; \nGov 5; Gov 6 at 4); a $323 medical account (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Gov 5); a delinquent child \nsupport obligation in the approximate amount of $54,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Gov 3 at 14; Gov \n5; Gov 6 at 4); and a $265 Direct TV account (SOR \u00b6 1.e: Gov 3 at 15; Gov 6 at 4-5). \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant testified that he has been paying his past due child support payments \nfor the past two years. An allotment of $150 is taken out of his weekly paycheck. He \npays about $600 a month. He believes that he is currently $25,000 in arrears. After he \nand his wife divorced, she remarried. He believed that her new husband was going to \nadopt his daughter and that he no longer owed child support. He did not realize that he \nowed delinquent child support for 20 years. He learned that he owed delinquent child \nsupport when he applied for his commercial truck driver\u2019s license and the issue came up \nduring a background check. He was given the opportunity to submit documents after the \nhearing verifying that he was paying child support. He did not submit additional \ndocuments.  (Tr at 14-17) He has not made payments towards any of his other debts. \nHe intends to pay his debts off one at a time. He has no credit cards and no checking \naccount. He lives on a cash basis. (Tr at 18-19, 21) \n \nIn 2007, Applicant discovered that he had cancer. He had surgery in June 2007. \nHe had no health insurance. The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c are costs \nrelated to the surgery. He was unable to work for about a month after the surgery.  \nBetween 2003 and 2006, Applicant did not have a job. He did not feel like working.  \nDuring this time, he stayed with friends. (Tr at 40-42) \n \nApplicant\u2019s current net monthly income varies. He earns between $1,200 to \n$1,400 per month when he works in the office. He earns between $2,400 to $3,000 per \nmonth when he is driving trucks on the road. His monthly expenses include: rent $200, \ngroceries $75, utilities $100, car expenses $50, past-due child support $650, and \nmiscellaneous $50. His total monthly expenses are $1,125. Applicant testified that he \nusually has $400 to $500 left over each month after his bills are paid. (Tr at 20-23) \n \nApplicant has a history of criminal arrests from August 1984 to June 2005. The \narrests include: \n \nA December 9, 2007, arrest for a probation violation.  He was arrested for not \npaying all of the fines related to the April 15, 2007, offense. He claims he still owed 50 \ncents. He appeared in court paid the 50 cents and the judge dismissed the charge. (Gov \n2 at 5; Gov 3 at 7, 12) \n \nAn April 15, 2007, ticket for Registration/Title Fail to Transfer and Vessel Derelict \nAbandoned. Applicant purchased a house boat. The boat sank. Prior to the boat \nsinking, he did not get a bill of sale or title. He did not register the boat. The Fish and \nGame Department issued him a ticket for abandoned vessel. He was fined $525 and \nplaced on probation. (Tr at 24-25; Gov 2 at 5; Gov 3 at 11)  \n \nA June 29, 2005, arrest and charge for Dangerous Drugs, a Controlled \nSubstance. Applicant was living with someone who he knew to be drug dealer. The \npolice raided the home and Applicant was arrested because he was at the house at the \ntime of the raid. He claims he did not participate in any drug activity. He lived with his \nfriend for a year. Applicant never appeared in court or heard of any further \nrequirements. He believes the case was dismissed because Hurricane Katrina \n\n \n4 \n \n \ndestroyed the court records. He moved out of the area after the Hurricane. (Tr at 28-30; \nGov 3 at 12). The record does not indicate the disposition of this charge.  \n \nAn August 24, 2000, arrest and charges for Out of State Fugitive, and Forgery, a \nfelony. In 1996, Applicant bought a pickup truck from a friend in another state. He asked \nhis friend if he could sign the title in order to trade in the car since title had not \ntransferred. His friend told him it was okay but later changed his mind after Applicant \nhad forged his name on the title. His friend went to the police. He was not aware that his \nfriend went to the police until he was arrested in 2000. On October 5, 2008, Applicant \npled no contest and paid a fine and forefeitures. (Tr at 31-33; Gov 2 at 5; Gov 3 at 7, 16-\n17; Gov 4) \n \nA November 17, 1984, arrest and charge for Shoplifting. He was 22 and \nhomeless at the time. He stole some groceries. (Tr at 34; Gov 2 at 6) \n \nAn August 27, 1984, arrest and charge for Damage to Property, Burglary, and \nLarceny. He admits to breaking and entering a grocery store. The charges were \ndismissed. (Tr at 35; Gov 2 at 6)  \n \nApplicant did not provide any evidence pertaining to his work performance and \noverall character.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant owes approximately $54,000 \nin delinquent child support and had four other delinquent accounts, an approximate total \nof $1,661.  \n \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \n\n \n6 \n \n \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \n\u00b6E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sept, 22, 2005)).  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. \nApplicant owes a significant amount of past due child support. He neglected his child \nsupport obligation over a long period of time. His daughter is now an adult.  He has not \ntaken any action towards resolving his four other delinquent accounts even though it \nappears to be within his means to do so. His failure to address his delinquent accounts \ncontinues to raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and judgment. \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) does not apply. While it is acknowledged \nApplicant was diagnosed with cancer in 2007 which resulted in the three delinquent \nmedical accounts alleged in the SOR, his financial information reveals that it is within \nhis means to pay his delinquent accounts. By his own volition, Applicant did not work for \nthree years from 2003 to 2006 which aggravated his child support issue. While \nApplicant\u2019s illness was a factor beyond his control, looking at his conduct over the past \nsix years, I cannot say that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. It was and is \nwithin his discretion to take control of his financial situation. He chose not to do so. He \ndid not act responsibly under the circumstances.  \n \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. Applicant has not attended financial counseling. All of five \ndelinquent accounts remain unresolved. It is unlikely that his financial situation will be \nresolved in the near future.  \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) does not apply. Although Applicant testified that he \nis paying $650 a month towards his delinquent child support obligation, he provided no \nproof to corroborate his assertion even though the record was held open to allow him \nthe opportunity to do so. He took no steps towards resolving his remaining four \ndelinquent accounts even though each debt\u2019s balance is relatively low and within his \nmeans to resolve.   \n \nApplicant has not mitigated the concerns raised under Guideline F.    \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern raised under the criminal conduct guideline is set forth in \u00b6 30 of \nthe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines: \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \n \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \n \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nThere are two Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) which apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case. CC DC \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) and \nCC DC \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted) apply. Between 1984 to \n2007, Applicant was arrested and/or cited for criminal offenses on seven occasions. \nThree of the arrests occurred within the past five years. His August 24, 2000, arrest \ninvolved a felony offense \u2013 forgery. In 2005, he was arrested for Dangerous Possession \nof a Controlled Substance.   \n   \nThe following Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (CC MC) are relevant to \nApplicant\u2019s case: \n \nCC MC \u00b6 32(a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not \napply. Appellant\u2019s last criminal citation occurred in December 2007 - a year and a half \nago. Considering his overall history of criminal offenses, I cannot conclude sufficient \ntime has elapsed since his last offense or that it is unlikely to recur. Applicant\u2019s criminal \nhistory raises questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nCC MC \u00b6 33(d) (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not \nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive \ncommunity involvement) does not apply. Insufficient time has passed since Applicant\u2019s \nlast criminal offense to conclude Applicant has been successfully rehabilitated. \nApplicant provided no information about his employment record. \n \nConsidering his history of criminal conduct, Applicant has not met his burden to \nmitigate the security concerns raised under criminal conduct.  \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \nAG &24:       \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \n\n \n8 \n \n \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DI DC) & 25(a) (any drug \nabuse); and DI DC \u00b6 25(c) (illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia) are \nrelevant to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant admits to a 30-year history of illegally using \nmarijuana on a regular basis.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from drug involvement. Two potentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Drug \nInvolvement Mitigating Condition (DI MC) \u00b6 26(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, \nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment) does not  apply. While Applicant claims that he stopped using marijuana in \n2004, not enough time has passed to conclude his past marijuana use is no longer a \nconcern based on his admitted daily use of marijuana over such a lengthy period of \ntime. Doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment remain because \nof Applicant\u2019s lengthy history of marijuana use.  DI MC \u00b6 26(a) does not apply. \n \n \nThe second mitigating condition that potentially applies is FC MC & 26(b) (a \ndemonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation \nfrom drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment \nwhere drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and (4) a signed \nstatement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation.)  Applicant \ntestified that he no longer uses marijuana and no longer associates with anyone who \nuses marijuana. Considering Applicant\u2019s lengthy history of illegal marijuana use and his \nomission of his illegal drug use on his security clearance application, I give Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony little credibility.  FC MC \u00b6 26(b) does not apply.  \n \n \nThe drug involvement concerns are not mitigated. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nPersonal conduct concerns are raised because Applicant failed to list an arrest that \nincluded a felony offense in response to question 23(a) on his e-QIP application, dated \nFebruary 13, 2008. He also omitted his illegal marijuana use in response to question \n24(a) on the same e-QIP application.   \n \n  \nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) potentially applies in \nApplicant\u2019s case. For PC DC \u00b6 16(a) to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission of his delinquent \naccounts must be done with a deliberate intent to deceive. I find Applicant intended to \nfalsify his security clearance application with respect to his failure to list his illegal \nmarijuana use in response to question 24(a). The question required him to list his illegal \ndrug use within 7 years prior to completing his application. He did not stop using \nmarijuana until 2004. As such, he was required to list any illegal marijuana use \noccurring after February 13, 2001 \u2013 the seven-year time period required by the \nquestion. From February 2001 to January 2004, Applicant used marijuana on a daily \nbasis. His claim that he simply forgot to list his past marijuana use on his e-QIP \napplication is not credible.  \n \n \nI considered the mitigating conditions under personal conduct and find that none \napply with respect to his deliberate omission of his marijuana use on his e-QIP \napplication. \n  \n \nWith regard to Applicant\u2019s omission of his August 24, 2000 arrest for Out-of-State \nFugitive and Forgery \u2013 a felony in response to section 23(a) on the e-QIP application, I \nfind his omission was not deliberate. Based on his educational background, it is unlikely \nApplicant would distinguish between the nuances of criminal charges that are felonies \nand criminal charges that are misdemeanors. SOR \u00b6 4.a is found for Applicant.  \n \n  \n \nSecurity concerns under personal conduct remain due to Applicant\u2019s deliberate \nomission of his illegal marijuana on his e-QIP application. Applicant provided insufficient \nevidence to mitigate the security concerns raised under personal conduct. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \n\n \n10 \n \n \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n        \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult. \nConsidering his history of criminal offenses, his 30-year history of illegal drug use, the \ndeliberate omission of his illegal drug use on his e-QIP application, and his failure to \nadequately address his financial issues, concerns about Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, \njudgment and reliability remain. Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised \nunder Financial Considerations, Criminal Conduct, Drug Involvement, and Personal \nConduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 4, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 4.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 4.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n11 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

She also provided additional information to support her request for eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Applicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated \nherein. After a thorough review of the record, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make \nthe following additional findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old field engineer who has worked for a defense contractor \nsince Spring 2008, and she is seeking to obtain a security clearance. Her husband \nworks for a telephone company. (Tr. 30) Applicant and her husband have been married \nten years. Applicant has three children under the age of 14. (Tr. 27, 31) The oldest child \ncurrently lives in a behavioral facility run by the state. (Tr. 32)  \n \n \nIn 1995 or 1996, Applicant obtained a $1,859 loan for the down payment on a \nFord Escort. That car was repossessed. (Ex. 2) Neither the loan nor this vehicle \nrepossession is listed as a debt of concern in the SOR.  \n \nIn 1999, before her marriage, Applicant purchased a 1998 Pontiac Grand Am on \nwhich she traded in a vehicle and paid an additional $11,000. (Tr. 54) She made her \n$229 monthly payments for two years before the car was repossessed in 2002, when \nshe defaulted on the loan. (Ex. 2) In August 2008, the creditor first contacted Applicant \nabout the remaining $19,335 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.o). (Ex. 3, page 14, Tr. 54) Applicant paid \n$250 per month for three months in 2008. The creditor then demanded the monthly \npayment increase to $450. (Tr. 56) Applicant requested the creditor provide proof of the \nbalance following the sale of the vehicle. When she received no reply, she stopped her \npayments. (Tr. 57) Applicant intends to make further payment when the creditor \nprovides the requested documentation. Applicant asserts the creditor\u2019s claim is barred \nby the statute of limitations. (Answer to SOR) In March 2009, the creditor brought suit \non this debt. (Tr. 57) Applicant\u2019s court date was a month after the hearing. (Tr. 56)  \n \n \nIn May 2000, she married her spouse. As a network technician her annual salary \nwas $20,000 and her husband\u2019s salary as a service manager was $35,000. Following \n\n \n3 \n \n \ntheir marriage, they obtained and used several credit cards. In 2001, her husband was \nlaid off from his job and they moved from Idaho to Nebraska with their children. (Tr. 25) \nShortly after their arrival, her husband was again laid off. (Tr. 25) Applicant worked for a \ncompany for a month before being laid off and starting her own business building \ncomputers and doing networks. (Tr. 26) In 2001, they moved to Mississippi where her \nhusband found similar work. They lived in Mississippi one year. (Tr. 34)  \n \n \nIn 2002, they moved back to Nebraska. (Tr. 34) Applicant experienced marital \nproblems and separated from her spouse. They reconciled. In 2003, he was laid off \nwhile they lived in Nebraska. In 2004, they returned to Idaho where her husband was \nunemployed for six months and she was unemployed for two and a half years. (Ex. 2, \nTr. 35, 36, Answer to SOR, Tr. 35) \n \n \nAt a date not listed in the record, Applicant became the legal guardian of her 16-\nyear-old brother when her mother died. In May 2008, Applicant moved to her current \nlocation and obtained a job as a field engineer. (Tr. 27, 35) From May 2008 through July \n2008, Applicant and her husband were separated due to marital problems. (Tr. 37) In \n2008, Applicant and her husband moved to their current location. As of June 2008, her \nannual salary was $40,000. (Ex. 2) Applicant reconciled with her husband. His salary is \n$51,000. (Tr. 65)  \n \n \nThe moves and job losses strained their marriage and their finances. Applicant \nand her husband separated and filed for divorce four times. (Ex. 2) She provided dates \nfor only two of the separations. In the fall of 2004, she incurred a $1,265 debt (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a) to her divorce attorney. The creditor has agreed to accept $125 monthly payments \non this debt. (Tr. 38) Applicant is waiting for a letter confirming the arrangement before \nshe begins payment. (Tr. 38)  \n \n \nIn October 2001, Applicant and her husband purchased a two-year-old \nSuburban. (Tr. 45) In 2002, the vehicle was involuntarily repossessed. (Ex. 2) The \ncreditor informed her husband of the balance owed on the vehicle following possession. \nApplicant never knew the balance due (SOR \u00b6 1.h, Tr. 46). The information was sent to \nher husband and he had already left the home due to a divorce filing. In June 2008, \nduring a personal subject interview Applicant stated she intended to pay the debt. (Ex. \n2) At the hearing, Applicant stated she was still responsible for the debt and would like \nto make a settlement or payment arrangement on this debt. (Tr. 46) \n \n \nWhen Applicant moved to Mississippi in 2001, the cellular phone service provider \ndid not have service in the area. Applicant was told she would still have to pay the debt \n(SOR \u00b6 1.f). This cellular phone account (SOR \u00b6 1.f) was settled in full. (Ex. A, Ex. B, Tr. \n42) Applicant also paid another telephone account (SOR \u00b6 1.g) of $343. (Answer to \nSOR, Ex. B, Ex. 2, Ex. 1, Tr. 42) \n \n \nApplicant had a $312 gas utility bill (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and a $265 power bill (SOR \u00b6 \n1.d) turned over for collection, which she has paid. (Answer to SOR, Ex. B, Ex. D, Tr. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n41) Applicant paid a $241 television service provider account (SOR \u00b6 1.e). (Answer to \nSOR, Ex. E, Tr. 41) Applicant paid two medical debts: a $298 medical debt (SOR \u00b6 1.c) \n(Answer to SOR, Ex. C, Tr. 40) and a $155 medical debt (SOR \u00b6 1.j) (Answer to SOR, \nEx. C, Tr. 48). The credit card debts listed in SOR \u00b6 1.i ($1,008) and SOR \u00b6 1.k ($1,000) \nare two different credit cards with the same creditor. The creditor had sent Applicant a \nsettlement offer, which she intends to accept. (Tr. 47, 50) Applicant asserts the $1,097 \ncollection account (SOR \u00b6 1.m) for a department store has been paid. (Tr. 53)  \n \n \nIn 2001 or 2002, Applicant incurred a $3,659 correspondence school debt (SOR \n\u00b6 1.l) for a course in electronic engineering. She was paying $100 monthly on the debt \nuntil it became delinquent in 2003. (Ex. 2) She was last contacted about this debt three \nyears ago. (Tr. 51) She intends to pay the debt, but plans to pay those obligations \nappearing in her CBR first. (Tr. 52)  \n \n \nIn 2006, Applicant obtained a $676 educational loan (SOR \u00b6 1.p) for an online \ncriminal justice course. (Ex. 2) She dropped the course before it started, but the creditor \nwould not refund the money. At the time of her personal interview, Applicant stated she \ndid not intend to pay this debt. (Ex. 2) In her answer to the SOR, Applicant asserted this \ndebt is barred by the statute of limitation, but she intended to pay this debt within a year \nof May 2009. (Answer to SOR) At the hearing, she reasserted she intends to pay this \ndebt. Applicant owes $716 on another student loan (SOR \u00b6 1.q). She intends to pay this \ndebt. (Tr. 60)  \n \n \nIn 2001, Applicant incurred a $1,167 credit card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.s). In October \n2008, the creditor offered a 50% settlement offer with three payments of $194 each. \n(Ex. 2) In her response to the SOR, Applicant asserted this debt was barred by the \nstatute of limitation, but she intended to pay this debt within a year of May 2009. \n(Answer to SOR) At the hearing, she reasserted her intent to pay this debt. (Tr. 61)  \n \n  \n \nApplicant asserts the multiple moves, periods of unemployment and \nunderemployment, and periods of separation when she and her husband maintained \nseparate household added to their financial problems. Some of the SOR accounts do \nnot appear on Applicant\u2019s credit bureau reports (CBR). (Ex. 2, Ex. C) \n \n \nIn March 2009, Applicant purchased a $123,000 home with monthly mortgage \npayments of $1,200. (Tr. 66) Applicant recently purchased a 2006 Honda with $313 \nmonthly car payments. (Tr. 67) She also has a $425 monthly car payment on her 1995 \nLandrover. Applicant has five credit cards with a balance on each of under $600. (Tr. \n70) She is current on her credit cards, her mortgage, car payments, and utilities. (Ex. 2) \nApplicant\u2019s monthly net income (gross income less monthly expenses and payment on \ndebts) is $500 to $600. (Tr. 71) Applicant is willing to pay her remaining unpaid \nobligations by making small payments on them or by paying off one and then paying off \nthe next one. (Tr. 73) Applicant has attended no financial counseling.

In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nAdjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \n\n \n8 \n \n \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts as agreed. Absent \nsubstantial evidence of extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a \nhistory of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is \ninconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt \nfree, but is required to manage her finances to meet her financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems. Applicant had 19 accounts placed \nfor collection, which totaled approximately $36,500. Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 \n19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nApplicant paid seven debts totaling $2,056. She asserted, but provided no \nsupporting documentation, that she has paid two debts of $1,097 (SOR \u00b6 1.m) and \n$788 (SOR \u00b6 1.t). Nine of the SOR debts totaling approximately $32,000 remain unpaid. \nShe intends to pay some of these debts and has received settlement offers on some of \nthem, but has yet to make payment on these debts. Applicant intends to pay her \nattorney fees (SOR \u00b6 1.a), a credit card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.s), and three student loans (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.l, 1.p and 1.q). A creditor was suing Applicant for a deficiency balance from a \nrepossessed car (SOR \u00b6 1.o). This debt ($19,335) represents more than 50 percent of \nthe SOR debt ($36,476). \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the \nAppeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence because she has nine delinquent debts totaling more than \n$32,000. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). The nine debts remain unpaid, which \nmakes them recent and frequent. Therefore, AG & 20(a) does not apply. \n \nAG & 20(b) partially applies because Applicant=s financial problems were \ncontributed to by her and her husband\u2019s traveling to different locations in search of work \nand their marital problems. Applicant and her husband experienced periods of \nunemployment and underemployment. However, she has been employed with her \ncurrent employer more than a year and a half.  \n \n \nApplicant has attended no financial counseling. She is current on her five credit \ncards, mortgage, car payments, and utilities. Applicant still owes more than $32,000. \nWith so much owed, there is no clear indication the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control. AG & 20(c) does not apply.  \n \nApplicant has paid 7 of the 19 debts and wants to pay more of her debts. Paying \nthe seven debts shows a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts. AG & 20(d) applies to these seven debts. Applicant asserted, but failed to \ndocument, that two additional debts were paid. Without documentation showing these \ndebts have been paid, these debts are still of concern. If Applicant accepted the \nsettlement offers presented by three of her creditors and made payment in accord with \nthe settlement agreement, AG & 20(d) would also apply to those debts. However, \nApplicant has only a desire to pay the remaining debts, without any payment.  \n \nApplicant asserted that a number of her debts are barred by the statute of \nlimitations, but she acknowledges these debts and wants to pay them. Applicant was \npaying on one of the repossessions before a dispute resulted in her stopping additional \npayments. Applicant has not disputed the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the \ncause of the problem. Nor has she provided documented proof to substantiate the basis \nof the dispute or provided evidence of actions to resolve the issue. AG & 20(e) does not \napply. The unpaid debts raise concerns about her current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n10 \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s marital difficulties and \ntravel searching for employment contributed to her financial problems. She has been \nemployed in her current job for more than a year and a half and has started to address \nher past-due obligations. She has been able to pay more than $2,000 on seven of her \ndelinquent accounts. There is no accepted settlement agreement or repayment plan for \nthe nine remaining debts. Applicant\u2019s one repossession ($19,335, SOR & 1.o) \nrepresents approximately 60 per cent of what remains unpaid. Applicant wants to pay \nher past-due obligations, but has yet to establish a repayment plan. The other eight \ndebts total approximately $13,000.  \n \nThree of the creditors have offered settlements, which Applicant has yet to \naccept and pay. Applicant needs to establish a good-faith effort to address or repay the \nnine remaining obligations. A systematic, concrete method of handling her debts is \nneeded, which is not present here. With these unaddressed obligations her financial \ncircumstances raise concerns about her fitness to hold a security clearance. \n \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot \nor will not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to justify the award \nof a security clearance. The awarding of a security clearance is not a once in a lifetime \noccurrence, but is based on applying the factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to \nthe evidence presented. Under the Applicant=s current circumstances, a clearance is not \nwarranted. Should the Applicant be afforded an opportunity to reapply for a security \nclearance in the future, having paid the delinquent obligations, established compliance \nwith a repayment plan, or otherwise addressed the obligations, she may well \ndemonstrate persuasive evidence of her security worthiness.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \n\n \n11 \n \n \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b\u20141.g:  \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h\u20141.i: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k\u20141.m: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \nThe SOR contains no \u00b6 1.n.  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o\u20141.t: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On November 24, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct)  of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested the case be decided on the written record.  On March 31,\n2009, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Rita C. O\u2019Brien denied Applicant\u2019s request\nfor a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\nIn his appeal brief, Applicant claims that the record indicates the presence of two tax liens in the amounts of\n1\n$20,000 and $3,000.  \nApplicant\u2019s arguments on appeal specifically address only the SOR allegation dealing with falsification of the\n2\ntax liens.  Another SOR allegation alleged falsification regarding past due debts more than 90 or 180 days delinquent.\nEven making allowances for his pro se status, Applicant does not address this allegation on appeal.  There is no\npresumption of error below.  The Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is therefore sustainable on her resolution\nof the allegation of falsification about past due debts alone.\nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: (1) whether certain findings of fact made by\nthe Judge, including the finding that Applicant falsified answers on a security clearance application,\nare supported by the record, and (2) whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable decision. \nApplicant  contends that the Judge made unsupportable findings of fact, including  a finding\nthat Applicant had a 21-year-old son and including inaccurate details regarding the status of federal\ntax liens.  The record indicates that Applicant has two children, both girls, who are listed in\nApplicant\u2019s 2008 security clearance application.  The Judge cited this documentary evidence when\nmaking the finding that Applicant had two children, a boy and a girl.  The Board notes that the name\nof one of the girls could be misconstrued as a masculine name.  This error on the part of the Judge\nis harmless.  Applicant also claims that the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant incurred two separate\nfederal tax liens in the amounts of $15,000 and $21,000 is erroneous.   After a review of the record\n1\nevidence, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s findings regarding the tax liens are sustainable.\nApplicant argues on appeal that he did not falsify his 2008 security clearance application.\nHe specifically argues that the tax liens that are the subject of one of the falsification allegations do\nnot appear on a May, 2009 credit report which he attached to his appeal brief.  The 2009 credit report\nis new evidence, which the Board cannot consider on appeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Moreover, the\ncontents of a May 2009 credit report have no bearing on the state of Applicant\u2019s finances in April\n2008, when he completed his security clearance application, nor do they have any bearing on\nApplicant\u2019s knowledge or state of mind at the time he completed the security clearance application.\nApplicant also argues that the financial events that were the subject of the falsification allegations\ntook place in 1998, 1999, and 2000, and were thus beyond the 7-year limit imposed by the questions\nhe supposedly provided false answers to.  A review of the record reveals that the underlying federal\ntax delinquencies that led to the imposition of tax liens took place in 1998, 1999, and 2000.  The\nliens themselves, however, which were the subject of the question on the security clearance\napplication, date from 2002 and 2004.\nAs mentioned by the Judge, the record contains evidence that Applicant admitted to a security\ninvestigator in July 2008 that he did not disclose derogatory information about his finances on the\nsecurity clearance application because he did not think the debts or the liens would appear on his\ncredit report.  The Judge reasonably treated this statement as an admission supportive of a conclusion\nthat Applicant had the requisite intent to hide information from the government.  Applicant has failed\nto demonstrate that the Judge\u2019s finding of falsification was unsupportable.  \n2\nApplicant states that the Judge\u2019s decision is misleading because it focuses on isolated\n\nincidents of his past, and does not look at his full background or all of the \u201cfederal documentation\u201d\n(unspecified) that exists in the case.\nThere is a rebuttable presumption that the Judge has considered all the record evidence unless\nhe or she states otherwise.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-00196 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009).  That\npresumption is not overcome in this case, principally because Applicant does not indicate with any\nmeaningful specificity what portions of the record the Judge failed to consider.\nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with\nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3\n(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).  \nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy and serious history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.  At the time of the close of the record, Applicant still had substantial delinquent\ndebts.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge could reasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems were still ongoing.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul.3, 2007).  The\nJudge also reasonably concluded that the Applicant hade provided false answers about his financial\nhistory to the government.  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against\nthe length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of\nrelevant mitigating conditions and whole-person factors.  She found in favor of Applicant as to one\nof the factual allegations listed in the SOR.  However, she reasonably explained why the evidence\nwhich Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant\nevidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for her decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection\nbetween the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfs.

Moreover, the contents of a May 2009 credit report have no bearing on the state of Applicant\u2019s finances in April 2008, when he completed his security clearance application, nor do they have any bearing on Applicant\u2019s knowledge or state of mind at the time he completed the security clearance application. Applicant also argues that the financial events that were the subject of the falsification allegations took place in 1998, 1999, and 2000, and were thus beyond the 7-year limit imposed by the questions he supposedly provided false answers to. A review of the record reveals that the underlying federal tax delinquencies that led to the imposition of tax liens took place in 1998, 1999, and 2000. The liens themselves, however, which were the subject of the question on the security clearance application, date from 2002 and 2004. As mentioned by the Judge, the record contains evidence that Applicant admitted to a security investigator in July 2008 that he did not disclose derogatory information about his finances on the security clearance application because he did not think the debts or the liens would appear on his credit report. The Judge reasonably treated this statement as an admission supportive of a",

Delaney, Esquire, Department Counsel \n \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nO\u2019BRIEN, Rita C., Administrative Judge: \n \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, I conclude that \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised under the guidelines for \nfinancial considerations and personal conduct. Accordingly, his request for a security \nclearance is denied. \n \n \nOn April 8, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to request a security clearance required as part of his \nemployment with a defense contractor (Item 5). After reviewing the results of the \nensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding1 that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request.  \n \n \n1 \n \n \n                                                          \nOn November 24, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) (Item 1), that specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in \n \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as \namended. \nMarch 31, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nthe Directive under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal \nConduct) of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG). \n \nApplicant received the SOR on December 9, 2008. He signed his Answer on \nDecember 17, 2008, and requested a decision without a hearing. On January 13, 2009, \nDOHA Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant materials (FORM)2 in support of \nthe government\u2019s preliminary decision. Applicant was given 30 days from the date he \nreceived the FORM to file a response. He did not respond. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR did not provide clear-cut admissions or denials to \neach allegation. He answered each allegation under Guideline F by denying any \u201cfailure \nor inability to satisfy debts and meet financial obligations\u201d and providing explanations \nregarding each allegation. I construe Applicant's Answer as follows: he admits with \nexplanation allegations 1.a., and 1.b. He denies allegation 1.c. because he considers it \nto be a duplicate of 1.b. Applicant admits 1.d.and 1.e., which he refers to as \u201cState and \nMunicipal charges.\u201d Applicant admits with explanation the medical debts at allegations \n1.f., 1.g., 1.h., and 1.i. Under Guideline E, he denied allegations 2.a. and 2.b.  \n \nThe case was assigned to me on March 24, 2009, for an administrative decision \nbased on the record. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as fact. After a \nthorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the FORM, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 47 years old and has been married for 24 years. He is the father of a \n21-year-old son and a 17-year-old daughter (Item 14). He earned a Bachelor of Science \ndegree in 2006 and is currently employed as a senior systems engineer. Applicant was \nunemployed for approximately 9 months between 2002 and 2003 (Item 5). The record is \nsilent as to Applicant's annual income or monthly net remainder after meeting expenses \nand debts. During his security interview, he stated that he meets his current obligations, \nother than the debts alleged in the SOR (Item 4). The SOR debts amount to $43,735. \n. \nApplicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in 1997, which resulted from the \nfailure of his delivery business (Item 4). He met his obligations under the Chapter 13 \npayment plan and the bankruptcy was discharged in 2000 (Item 9). In 1998, the year \nafter he filed for bankruptcy, Applicant started a software-consulting business. This \nbusiness failed in 1999. After filing his 1999 tax return, the IRS informed him that he \nowed $15,256 because he failed to pay workman\u2019s compensation taxes. Applicant \n \n2 See Directive, Enclosure 3, Section E3.1.7. The FORM included 14 documents (Items 1 - 14) proffered \nin support of the government\u2019s case. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \ncontacted a financial professional in approximately 2000 (Item 6). This professional3 \nsubmitted a letter confirming that Applicant has been working with him since that time \nregarding his \u201cfederal tax payment short-fall [that] occurred in 1998, 1999, and 2000\u201d \nwhile Applicant was a \u201cself-employed independent contractor.\u201d (Item 4). The EA also \nnoted that \u201cPrior to this period you owned a freight expediting company which incurred \nsignificant losses and you accumulated significant personal debt as a result of these \nbusiness losses.\u201d (Item 4). It is unclear from the record whether this business is the \nsame as the one that resulted in the 1997 bankruptcy. \n \nAccording to the EA, Applicant has overpaid his taxes since the IRS lien was \nfiled. His resulting tax refunds have been applied to the debt, but this has not \nsubstantially decreased Applicant's liability because of the  \n \nIRS practice of applying payments you make to your oldest \nbalance. This has the effect of causing the outstanding \nbalance to increase because the greatest penalty rates for \nunderpayments apply to the most current tax periods.\u201d (Item \n4). \n \nBoth Applicant and the EA noted that the IRS has transferred his case file to several \ndifferent IRS offices and different case workers, causing delay in resolving the issue \n(Items 4 and 6). The EA stated that he and Applicant had approximately monthly \ncontact with the IRS in 2001; thereafter, the pace decreased to about twice per year \nbetween 2002 and 2008. Efforts have been increased as of December 2008 (Item 4). \nWhen Applicant met with an agent for his Subject Interview for this investigation, he \nreported that the EA advised him of a 10-year statute of limitations on IRS debts. \nApplicant was \u201chopeful the debts will be resolved as a result of the statute of limitation \nrule.\u201d (Item 4). \n \n \nApplicant claims in his Answer that the $15,000 lien at allegation at 1.b. and the \n$21,000 lien at 1.c. are the same IRS lien for Tax Year 1999, the difference being \nadded penalties and interest (Item 4). However, the EA referred to tax liabilities for Tax \nYears 1998, 1999 and 2000 (Item 4). In addition, the IRS Notice of Lien indicates that \nthe $21,000 debt results from liabilities for Tax Years 1999 (approximately $19,000) and \n2001 (approximately $2,000) (Item 11). I find that allegation 1.c. is not a duplicate of \nallegation 1.b. \n \n \nIn July 2008, Applicant learned that he also incurred a state tax lien as a result of \nfailing to pay state workman\u2019s compensation taxes. Applicant has not paid this debt \nbecause the EA advised him to resolve the federal liens before paying the state lien \n(Item 6). The EA\u2019s letter does not refer to the state tax lien (Item 4). \n \n \nThe four medical debts alleged at 1.f. through 1.i., which amount to $1,081, \nremain unpaid. Applicant reports that he incurred these debts in 2007 for treatment for \n \n3 Although Applicant referred to this professional as a CPA (certified public accountant), the letter (Item 4) \nidentifies him as an \u201cEA,\u201d which is how he will be identified in this decision. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nhimself and his daughter (Item 6). However, the credit bureau reports indicate that the \n$129 debt (allegation 1.f.) became delinquent in 2003 (Item 7) and the $237 debt \n(allegation 1.i.) has been past due since 2004 (Item 8). His insurance provider refused \nto pay them because Applicant could not provide proof that he was covered by medical \ninsurance for one year prior to the medical events (Items 4 and 6). At the time of his \nJuly 2008 security interview, he reported that he expected the issue to be resolved \nshortly. However, his response to the SOR in December 2008 shows that the debts \nremain unpaid (Item 4). \n \n \nApplicant did not disclose his federal or state tax liens or his delinquent debts \nwhen he completed his security clearance application in April 2008 (Items 1, 4, and 5). \nIn his Answer, he denied being dishonest, stating that he \u201cdid not purposely go out of \nmy way to falsify any document.\u201d (Item 4) He reported that he had reviewed his credit \nreport but did not find that it contained derogatory information; he did not submit a copy \nof the credit report. He characterized his omission as a mistake, noting that, \u201cPeople \nhave painful problems in their lives that cause pain even today when they\u2019re brought \nup\u2026.there are painful personal things in people\u2019s lives that they don\u2019t like to re-visit.\u201d \n(Item 4). However, when Applicant met with the security investigator in July 2008, he \nstated that he did not disclose them because he did not think the debts would appear on \nhis credit report Item 6). \n \nPolicies \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).4 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors \nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines, commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative \nof a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines \nshould be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent \npolicy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. In this \ncase, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties require consideration \nof the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest5 for an Applicant to either receive or continue to \nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of \nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or \nrevoke a security clearance for an Applicant. Additionally, the government must be able \n \n4 Directive. 6.3. \n \n5 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it \nthen falls to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.  \n \nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an Applicant bears a heavy \nburden of persuasion.6 A person who has access to classified information enters into a \nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the  \ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the \nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national \ninterests as his or his own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard \ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in \nfavor of the government.7 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b618 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, \nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and \nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to \ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may \nlead to financial crimes including espionage. Affluence that \ncannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially \nprofitable criminal acts. \n \n \nThe evidence contained in the FORM shows that Applicant has owed back taxes \nto the IRS since Tax Year 1998, and his medical debts go back to 2003. His nine-year \nhistory of failing  to meet his financial obligations support application of disqualifying \nconditions AG \u00b619 (a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b619 (c) (a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations). \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20, the following conditions that can potentially mitigate security \nconcerns are relevant::  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment \n \n6 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n \n7 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to pay the federal and state tax liens did not occur in the \ndistant past, because the debts are still delinquent. He has worked with a financial \nprofessional for several years, but his debts remain unresolved. Applicant was advised \nthe statute of limitations would apply to his debt and hopes the debts will no longer be \nenforceable. His desire to avoid his legitimate obligation to the federal government casts \ndoubt on his reliability and AG \u00b6 20a cannot be applied. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is relevant because several of Applicant\u2019s attempts at starting and \nmaintaining various independent businesses in the late 1990s failed, a condition that he \ncould not have predicted. Applicant lacked understanding of how workers compensation \ntaxes should be paid, and federal and state tax liens resulted. However, to be \napplicable, this mitigating condition requires that the person act responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Instead of acting responsibly, Applicant decreased his efforts to resolve \nthe IRS tax liens after 2001 (Item 4), ignored the state tax lien completely, and hoped \nthe statute of limitations would absolve him of the federal debt. AG \u00b6 20 (b) does not \napply.  \n \n \nApplicant worked with a financial professional on his tax liens, implicating AG \n20(c). However, it cannot be applied because Applicant has not brought the problem \nunder control, has not paid the IRS or state government, and has not set up a payment \nplan for any debt. In fact, it appears that he is waiting for the statute of limitations to run. \nFor the same reasons, mitigation is unavailable under AG \u00b6 20(d). Applicant has paid \nnone of the debts alleged in the SOR, including the relatively small medical debts. As \nnone of the mitigating conditions apply, I find against the Applicant on Guideline F. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \n\n \n7 \n \n \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16(a) applies (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award \nfiduciary responsibilities). When he completed his security clearance application in April \n2008, Applicant disclosed neither his tax liens nor his past due medical debts (Item 5). \nApplicant denies in his Answer that he deliberately falsified the information he provided \nto the government, maintaining that he made a mistake (Item 4). However, Applicant's \nadmission during his subject interview that he knew he was required to list his \ndelinquencies for the previous seven years (Item 4), and that he \u201cdid not reveal \ninformation regarding the liens and the delinquent accounts on his SF-86 because he \ndid not believe the debts would show on his credit report\u201d leaves little doubt that he had \nthe requisite intent to hide this information from the government.  \n \n \nThe potentially applicable mitigators are AG \u00b6 17(a) (the individual made prompt, \ngood-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being \nconfronted with the facts) and AG \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has \npassed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). Neither condition applies. The record \ncontains no evidence that Applicant attempted to inform the government of his financial \ndelinquencies. In addition, Applicant\u2019s falsification cannot be considered insignificant \nunder AG \u00b6 17(c). The government relies on information provided by Applicants, and \ndeliberate falsification both undermines the security clearance process, and casts \nserious doubts on an Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the \nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and \nall the circumstances. I have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the \nappropriate adjudicative factors under the cited Guideline. I have also reviewed the \nrecord before me in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence Applicant is 46 years old and \npresumed to be a mature, responsible adult.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nApplicant accrued significant debt since 1998. In response to the government\u2019s \nconcerns, he offered proof that he has worked with a financial professional on resolving \nthe federal tax lien. However, over approximately nine years, no resolution has been \nreached. It is significant that during his security investigation interview, Applicant said he \nhoped that the statute of limitations would resolve his federal debt. It is likely therefore, \nthat the reason these large debts have not been resolved is due, at least in part, to \nApplicant's hope that they will lapse based on age. Finally, Applicant's deliberate failure \nto disclose his debts on his security clearance application indicates a lack of \ntrustworthiness that is incompatible with the high standards required of those who are \ngranted access to classified information. A fair and common-sense assessment of the \navailable information bearing on Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance shows he \nhas not satisfied the doubts about his ability or willingness to protect the government\u2019s \ninterests. Because protection of the national interest is paramount in these \ndeterminations, such doubts must be resolved in favor of the government.8 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:.  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b: - 1.i. \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a: - 2.b. \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest \nto allow Applicant access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she denied \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.k , 2.c, and 2.e - 2.g, and admitted the remaining allegations. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 36 years old. She is currently married, but separated and has four children. She is the primary support for her children, although she does receive $822 per month from her estranged husband for child and spousal support. Since 2008, she has worked for a defense contractor.1 In response to government interrogatories, Applicant stated her financial difficulties occurred because the Army relocated her husband to a new post in 2007 and she could not find work in their new location for about seven months. However, when she became employed her new position paid considerably less than what she had been earning ($7.50 per hour compared to $18 per hour). The Applicant claims most of her debts became delinquent during her periods of unemployment and underemployment. Several debts do, however, predate her unemployment/underemployment period of 2007-2008 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o and 1.q).2 The debts listed in the SOR are supported by three credit reports dated July 21, 2009, May 3, 2008, and April 29, 2008.3 The total debt alleged in the SOR is approximately $40,000.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn August 17, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nto Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nJuly 13, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR with an undated response, and elected to have her \ncase decided on the written record. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM) on December 1, 2009. The FORM was mailed to \nApplicant, and it was received on December 10, 2010. Applicant was afforded an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. \nApplicant did not provide additional information. The case was assigned to me on May \n19, 2010.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she denied \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.k , 2.c, and 2.e - 2.g, and \nadmitted the remaining allegations. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings \nand exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 36 years old. She is currently married, but separated and has four \nchildren. She is the primary support for her children, although she does receive $822 \nper month from her estranged husband for child and spousal support. Since 2008, she \nhas worked for a defense contractor.1 In response to government interrogatories, \nApplicant stated her financial difficulties occurred because the Army relocated her \nhusband to a new post in 2007 and she could not find work in their new location for \nabout seven months. However, when she became employed her new position paid \nconsiderably less than what she had been earning ($7.50 per hour compared to $18 per \nhour). The Applicant claims most of her debts became delinquent during her periods of \nunemployment and underemployment. Several debts do, however, predate her \nunemployment/underemployment period of 2007-2008 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o and 1.q).2   \n \n \n \nThe debts listed in the SOR are supported by three credit reports dated July 21, \n2009, May 3, 2008, and April 29, 2008.3 The total debt alleged in the SOR is \napproximately $40,000. Applicant denied two of the seventeen debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and \n1.k). The first is a collection debt for a cable provider. Applicant fails to provide proof of \npayment for this debt, but she asserts that she still has this cable service. For the \nsecond debt, she does provide documentation showing the account has a zero \nbalance.4 Applicant admitted the remainder of the debts and failed to show proof of \npayment on any of the debts. She submitted a proposed payment plan with a debt \nconsolidation service that would cover approximately $4,800 of her existing debt, but \nthere was no evidence to support that she actually executed such a plan.5 \n \n \n                                                          \n1 Items 5, 6. \n \n2 Id. \n \n3 Items 7-9. \n \n4 Item 6. \n \n5 Id. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current financial picture shows that her net income ($4,091 per \nmonth) exceeds her net expenses ($3,050 per month) by about $1,000 per month. \nHowever, there is no evidence showing that she applies any of this discretionary \namount to her debts.6 Applicant stated that she has been getting financial advice, but \nother than mentioning the debt consolidation service, she did not specifically say who or \nwhat organization was providing that advice.7  \n \n \nThe personal conduct concerns arise out of Applicant\u2019s four arrests in July 1996, \nJune 2002, November 2002, and February 2008 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a \u2013 2.d).  Those arrests \ninclude: interfering with an emergency call in February 2008 (sentenced to probation); \ntwo arrests for assault in November and June 2002, both incidents were investigated \nand reported by the Fort Hood, Texas, Provost Marshal\u2019s Office (no charges filed in \neither case); and, a misdemeanor fraudulent check charge in July 1996 (charges filed, \nbut no information regarding disposition). The evidence in the record establishes these \narrests, including the one disputed by Applicant (she disputed one of the 2002 arrests, \nalthough she could not say which one).8 The remaining personal conduct allegations \nconcern whether Applicant falsified answers to security clearance applications (SF-86) \non April 16, 2008, and August 6, 1997, and on an enlistment eligibility questionnaire on \nAugust 6, 1997 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.e \u2013 2.g). In all three instances Applicant was asked about \nprior arrests. In answering the April 16, 2008, SF-86, although she did list her most \nrecent arrest for interfering with an emergency call, she failed to list her two arrests for \nassault on November 11, 2002 and June 8, 2002.9 Likewise, when she completed her \nAugust 6, 1997, SF-86 and her enlistment questionnaire on the same date, she failed to \nlist her arrest for fraudulent checks from July 31, 1996.10 Applicant claims that she did \nnot deliberately falsify these various forms, but instead simply forgot about the arrests at \nthe time she completed the forms.11 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n                                                          \n6 Item 6. \n \n7 Item 4. \n \n8 Items 10-12. \n \n9 Items  5,11-12. \n \n10 Items 5, 13-14. \n \n11 Item 3. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n\n \n5 \n \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nApplicant has approximately $40,000 in delinquent debt that remains unpaid or \nunresolved. I find both disqualifying conditions have been raised.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nExcept for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k, Applicant did not provide evidence that she \npaid or resolved any of her delinquent debts. Therefore, her behavior is recent and the \ndelinquent debts remain a concern. I find mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply \nbecause Applicant\u2019s debts remain unresolved. Applicant provided some information that \n\n \n6 \n \n \nshe experienced periods of unemployment/underemployment and is going through a \nseparation/divorce from her husband. However, I am unable to determine that her \nfinancial problems were beyond her control, particularly since several of the debts \noccurred before her employment and domestic problems occurred, or that she acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. I find AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. There is some \nevidence Applicant contacted a debt consolidation service for some of her debt, but \nthere is no evidence to show that she executed any agreement with the service or that \nthe debts are otherwise being resolved. There is no clear evidence that Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial problems are being resolved or under control. Other than showing that the debt \nlisted at SOR \u00b6 1.k has a zero balance, she did not provide evidence that she has made \na good-faith effort to pay her delinquent debts or has attempted to resolve them. I find \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applies to SOR debts \u00b6 1.k, but not to the remainder of the SOR debts. \nApplicant disputed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c, but did not provide any proof to show she \npaid the debt or resolved it. She argues that since she currently has service from this \ncable provider, then she must be current on obligations to them. I do not find this \nargument convincing. I find AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire; and \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information. \nBetween 1996 and February 2008, Applicant was arrested four times for writing \nfraudulent checks, committing two assaults, and interfering with an emergency call. As a \nwhole, these four criminal-related actions call into question Applicant\u2019s judgment. AG \u00b6 \n16(c) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a \u2013 2.d. In August 1997, Applicant completed an SF-86 and \n\n \n7 \n \n \nan enlistment document that asked her about prior arrests. She was charged with a \nmisdemeanor for writing fraudulent checks on July 31, 2006, just one year prior to the \ndate she filled out the two respective forms. I find Applicant\u2019s excuse of not \nremembering the arrest when she filled out the forms implausible. In April 2008, \nApplicant filled out another SF-86 and failed to list her two assault arrests that occurred \nin June and November of 2002. She also claims to have forgotten about these arrests \nwhen she filled out the SF-86. Again, given that there were two similar incidents where \nthe police were called to the scene and wrote out detailed reports, I find Applicant\u2019s lack \nof memory implausible. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.e \u2013 2.g.   \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 17 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nThe record is absent any evidence that Applicant made any efforts to correct her \nomissions before being notified of her falsifications. AG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply. \nAlthough each arrest by itself might be characterized as minor, the cumulative effect of \nfour arrests over a 12-year time frame calls into question Applicant\u2019s good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply.  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n  \n\n \n8 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have considered that the Applicant \nexperienced periods of unemployment/underemployment, and her current separation \nand possible divorce. I have also considered that she supports her four children. Except \nfor one debt showing a zero balance, she did not provide documentation to show she \npaid any of her delinquent debts. She did not provide information that she has an \nexecuted a repayment plan or settlement agreement with any of the creditors. \nAdditionally, her involvement in four separate arrests over a 12-year period reflects her \npoor judgment. She also engaged in deliberate falsification on three separate occasions \nwhen she failed to list her past criminal actions on security clearance questionnaires \nand enlistment paperwork. Therefore, she failed to provide sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the security concerns.  \n \nOverall the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nFinancial Considerations and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.k:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.l-1.q: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.g: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nRobert E.

On July 29, 2009, DOHA issued a notice of hearing \nscheduling the hearing which was held on August 25, 2009. \n \n \nThe government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 13, which were admitted into \nevidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through F, \nwhich were admitted into evidence. On September 1, 2009, the transcript (Tr.) was \nreceived. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, he denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6 2.a. He \nadmitted the factual allegations, with explanation, set forth in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. After a thorough review of \nthe record, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following additional findings of \nfact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 46-year-old who has worked as a program manager for a defense \ncontractor since March 2008, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. In August \n1985, Applicant married for the first time a woman he met in college. (Tr. 62) The \nmarriage ended in divorce 15 years later, in June 2003. Two sons were born of the \nmarriage, in February 1990 and March 1996, and a daughter was born in March 1998. \n(Ex. 1, Tr. 84) The children are now ages 11, 13, and 19. (Tr. 62) \n \n \nIn 1986, Applicant joined the Marine Corps and retired from the Corps in \nFebruary 2008. (Ex. F) He was a distinguished graduate at his basic communication \nofficers\u2019 course. (Ex. E) He was in the top 20% of his basic school and an honor student \nand the number one graduate of the 60 officers in his Operational Specialty School. (Tr. \n64, 65) At his first assignment, he was the number one rated second lieutenant in his \nregiment and number two rated second lieutenant at division level. (Tr. 67) From August \n1998 to May 1999, he attended the Army Command and General Staff College \ngraduating in the top 10% of 1,500 graduates. (Tr. 91) He attended class for a master\u2019s \ndegree at night and in 1999 obtained his master\u2019s degree in information technology. (Tr. \n92)  \n \n \nIn 1996, Applicant served in Bosnia. He left Bosnia to go to Liberia to conduct an \nevacuation of the U.S. Embassy in Monrovia. (Tr. 80) From 2002 through 2004, \n \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n\n \n3 \nApplicant was requested by name to serve at the White House Military Office. (Tr. 57) In \n2002, Applicant was awarded the Defense Meritorious Service Medal (DMSM). In 2004, \nhe received his second award of the DMSM. In 2006, he was awarded the Bronze Star \nmedal for his performance while being forward-deployed as commanding officer of a \nMarine Wing Communications Squadron in Iraq from January 2005 through September \n2005. In 2007, he was re-deployed to Iraq, was selected for promotion to colonel, and \nwas selected as a Marine Corps Fellow to attend a civilian university for one year. (Ex. \n10) His numerous awards and medals are listed in detail on his DD Form 214. (Ex. 11)  \n \nIn August 2003, Applicant remarried to an Air Force captain he had met when \nthey both were working at the White House. (Tr. 104) She had been previously married \nthree times and had a six-year-old son, born in July 1998. In mid-October 2004, their \nson was born. In late October 2004, Applicant took command of a squadron. (Tr. 131) \nWhile commanding the squadron, he normally left for work at 5:00 a.m. and returned at \nor after 8:00 p.m. (Tr. 109) In January 2005, Applicant deployed to Iraq for the first time \nand stayed there until mid-September 2005. (Tr. 110)  \n \nThree weeks after his return from Iraq, his wife was deployed to Iraq. (Tr. 114) \nShe was deployed until March 2006. Following her deployment, Applicant found his wife \nto be distant, distracted, and disengaged. (Tr. 117) He sensed emotional fallout of some \nsort. (Tr. 118) Initially, his wife stated she had been raped. Later, she related she had \nhad an affair with an Army colonel with whom she served while deployed.  \n \nAt the time he learned of the affair, Applicant\u2019s son was a toddler. Applicant \noffered to attend marriage counseling, but his wife stated it would not serve any \nconstructive purpose. They continued to live estranged in the same house. From \nJanuary 2007 through June 2007, Applicant was deployed to Iraq. During this \ndeployment, Applicant\u2019s wife sent him no mail, care packages, or pictures of their son. \n(Tr. 124) She sent a few emails related to financial matters and her need for money. \nWhile he was deployed, she sold his car. (Tr. 125) \n \nFollowing the deployment, they both had a permanent change of station (PCS) \nand purchased a large home at the new location. They continued to be estranged, living \nin the same home, but no longer sleeping together. (Tr. 130)  \n \n \n \nAt the squadron\u2019s 2004 Christmas party, Applicant met a woman, the wife of a \nMarine Corps captain who was under Applicant\u2019s command. From January 2005 \nthrough September 2005, while in Iraq, Applicant did not see or talk with this woman. \nBefore returning from Iraq, the woman\u2019s husband was deployed to Afghanistan. While \nher husband was overseas, the woman left the area to live with her mother in upstate \nNew York. (Ex. D) The woman stated \u201cshe barely knew him [Applicant] at the \nsquadron.\u201d (Ex. 6, page 81 of 81) Applicant states from mid-October 2004, when he \ntook command, until his TDY in January 2005, he had seen the woman twice. (Tr.133)  \n \n\n \n4 \n \nIn the spring of 2006, following the husband\u2019s return from Afghanistan, her \nhusband received (PCS) orders to New York for recruiting duty. In May or June 2006, \nthe woman had problems with the transportation of her household goods and sought \nApplicant\u2019s assistance. (Tr. 134, Ex. 6, page 77 of 81) Applicant took her to the \nadministration section, where she was helped with her transportation problem. The \nencounter lasted ten minutes. The next time he saw the woman was in August 2007. \nAfter the spring of 2006, the woman\u2019s husband was no longer a subordinate or within \nApplicant\u2019s command. (Tr. 139)  \n \n \nFollowing the PCS, the woman and her husband were estranged and slept in \nseparate rooms for a year before she moved back to her mother\u2019s home, which was \nmore that 150 miles from her husband\u2019s location, in May 2007. Around Easter 2007, \nApplicant received an email that included pictures of the woman\u2019s daughter. At that \ntime, the woman had the habit of emailing photos of her daughter to everyone. (Ex. 6, \npage 80 of 81) At the time, the woman did not realize Applicant was no longer at his \nstateside location, but was deployed to Iraq. As a commander, Applicant responded to \nthe email with a couple of sentences of normal small talk thanking her for the email and \nasking about her and her husband.  \n \n \nA few days later, the woman sent an email saying that she and her husband\u2019s \nmarriage was not going very well, that she and her husband were separated, and she \nhad moved back in with her mother. The woman stated her husband\u2019s second \ndeployment had led to the end of the marriage. (Ex. D) Applicant expressed the state of \nhis marriage. Applicant\u2019s son and the woman\u2019s daughter were approximately the same \nage. (Tr. 138) The emails increased in frequency until they became daily. \n \n \nIn June 2007, Applicant returned from his overseas deployment. With the \nmarriage ending, his wife hired a private detective to hack into Applicant\u2019s private \ncomputer. She learned of the emails between Applicant and the other woman. She also \nlearned that in August 2007, Applicant was going to visit his children in another state \nand would be spending the weekend at that location. She learned Applicant intended to \nmeet the other woman. The other woman had relatives near where Applicant\u2019s children \nlived and where Applicant would be visiting. Applicant stated the initial plan was to \nmeet, talk, have dinner, and the woman would then leave to return to stay with her \nrelatives. Applicant\u2019s wife had the private detective follow her husband to secure \nphotographs of the meeting with the other woman.  \n \nThe woman\u2019s arrival was delayed and after a late dinner she decided not to leave \nto drive to her relatives, but decided to spend the night with Applicant in his hotel room. \nThe woman states she had not met with Applicant until after she had obtained a \nseparation agreement from her husband. (Ex. D) Prior to their meeting, the woman had \npresented her husband with legal separation documents. (Ex. 6, page 79 of 81)  \n \nThe detective took pictures of the two in a parking lot. (Ex. 6) Upon receiving the \ndetective\u2019s report, Applicant\u2019s wife immediately called the woman\u2019s husband and told \n\n \n5 \nhim about the meeting. Even though they were separated, the woman\u2019s husband \nimmediately called his wife and started to harass her. (Tr. 158) When the woman asked \nApplicant what she should do, Applicant told her to simply deny everything to her \nhusband and to not answer her husband\u2019s phone calls. (Tr. 155) Applicant told the \nwoman to deny the meeting. The husband drove to Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s location to view \nthe photographs. Applicant\u2019s wife then called Applicant\u2019s command to inform them of \nthe events. \n \nIn mid-August 2007, Applicant was interviewed about the meeting with the other \nwoman. Initially, Applicant denied meeting with the woman, but before the interview \nended he admitted they had met and kissed. (Tr. 151) Following the interview, Applicant \nquestioned his wife about what had occurred and how anyone could have obtained his \npersonal emails. His wife denied all knowledge and speculated that maybe someone \nhad come into their home and hacked into his computer. Applicant stated that if he ever \ncame home and found a stranger in his home messing with his computer, he would \n\u201ctake them out.\u201d (Tr. 153) The hypothetical scenario response referred to no one in \nparticular and no one specifically was threatened.  \nIn August or September 2007, Applicant\u2019s wife filed for separation. (Tr. 218) \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s main concern was payment of the house mortgage. Applicant and his \nthen wife have since divorced and he is paying child support. (Tr. 224) In February \n2008, Applicant\u2019s wife was arrested and charged with assault after she threw coffee on \nApplicant. (Tr. 159) His wife now has a live-in boyfriend. (Tr. 166) Applicant was ordered \nto have no contact with the other woman. In March 2008, after Applicant had separated \nfrom the Marine Corps, Applicant resumed contact with the woman. Applicant and the \nother woman plan to live together starting in the summer of 2010. (Ex. D)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s Marine Corps Fellowship was immediately canceled as was his \npromotion to colonel. In November 2007, Applicant received nonjudicial punishment for \nviolations of Article 107 (False official statement); Article 133 (Conduct unbecoming an \nofficer); Article 134 (Obstructing justice); and Article 134 (Communicating a treat) of the \nUniform Code of Military Justice. Applicant entered into a Memorandum of Agreement \n(Ex. 5) accepting nonjudicial punishment and setting forth the offenses. The Article 107 \nviolation resulted from a statement given by Applicant in August 2007, where he initially \ndenied meeting with the woman and stated he had not shared a room with the woman \nduring a weekend two weeks earlier. The Article 133 violation was the result of the \ninappropriate relationship. The Article 134 violation resulted from Applicant asking the \nwoman to lie about their relationship if questioned by her husband. The second Article \n134 specification related to Applicant stating he would harm any stranger he found in his \nhome hacking into his computer and private emails.  \n \n \nApplicant was found to have committed the offenses. During the proceeding, \nApplicant stated he understood his actions were reprehensible. He was embarrassed by \nhis conduct and regretted the decisions he had made. (Ex. 8) Applicant realized his \nmilitary career was over and he should \u201ctake his lumps\u201d and get out of the Marine \n\n \n6 \nCorps. He chose not to appeal the punishment. He received a punitive Letter of \nReprimand (LOR) and a forfeiture of $2,500 pay for two months, a punishment he did \nnot appeal. (Ex. 7) \n \n \nIn October 2007, Applicant had submitted a voluntary retirement request in lieu of \nfurther administrative separation processing for cause. (Ex. 2, 10) In November 2007, \nApplicant submitted matters for consideration asking that he be retired at his current \ngrade. Applicant\u2019s retirement request was approved; however, he was retired in the \ngrade of major. In February 2008, he separated from the Marine Corps. (Ex. 11)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \n\n \n7 \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nPersonal Conduct  \n \nThe Directive sets out various factors relevant to an applicant=s personal conduct \nthat may be potentially disqualifying. Paragraph 15 of the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \nstates a concern where there is conduct \u201cinvolving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers \nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security \nclearance process.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n (a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative; \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; \n \n\n \n8 \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of \nsensitive corporate or other government protected information: \n \n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the \nworkplace;  \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources. \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another \ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is \nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a \nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group; \n \n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to \nthe employer as a condition of employment; and, \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity.  \n \nStarting in April 2007 and ending in August 2007, Applicant engaged in \ninappropriate conduct and demonstrated poor judgment, which resulted in his receipt of \nnonjudicial punishment under the UCMJ, and the end of his military career. His \njudgment and reliability were questionable. Applicant exercised poor judgment, lack of \ncandor, and dishonesty. He was unwilling to comply with rules and regulations. When \nasked about what had occurred the weekend in question, Applicant first denied any \nwrongdoing and later, during the same interview, admitted he had met and kissed the \nwoman.  \n \n\n \n9 \nApplicant\u2019s actions involve three major mistakes. First, the other woman was the \nwife of a fellow Marine. Second, he saw this woman before his and the other woman\u2019s \nmarriage had ended. Third, he was dishonest about his relationship with the woman. \nThe woman had a separation agreement when they met and is now divorced. Applicant \nis also now divorced. His inappropriate conduct ended his military career, impacted his \ndignity, and affected his military retirement. A lack of love can cause people to do things \nthey would not ordinarily do, as does a lack of love. Applicant was in a difficult position \nand made an inappropriate decision. He tried to maintain the peace with his wife, to live \nestranged from his wife in the same home, and to meet with the other woman. He \nshould have ended his marriage prior to seeing the other woman. His conduct with the \nwife of a fellow Marine was, as Applicant stated, reprehensible. AG \u00b6 16(b) and \u00b6 \n16(d)(1) apply. \n \nApplicant realizes his conduct was inappropriate. He acknowledged during the \nArticle 15 proceeding that his actions were reprehensible.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and, \n \n\n \n10 \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s nonjudicial punishment contained four allegations. AG \u00b6 17(a) \npartially applies to his statements made during his mid-August 2007 interview. Applicant \ninitially denied meeting with the woman, but before the interview ended he admitted \nthey had met and kissed. He was charged with false official statement. Applicant has \nadequately explained the obstruction of justice charge. Applicant told the other woman \nnot to answer her then husband\u2019s phone calls and to deny to her husband that they had \nbeen together. His conduct does not rise to an obstruction of justice charge. He also \nadequately explained the communicating of a threat. Applicant stated he would harm \nany stranger he found in his home hacking into his computer and private emails. This \ngeneral comment was directed at no specific individual, but was a response to a \nhypothetical scenario. No one specifically was threatened.  \n \n \nThe Article 133 violation was the result of the inappropriate relationship. \nApplicant knew his conduct was inappropriate, that his military career was over, that he \nshould take his punishment, and leave the service. He knew there was no reason to \nappeal this nonjudicial punishment. For his inappropriate conduct, he was strongly \npunished. The $2,500 loss of pay for two months was not as significant as his loss of \nthe educational fellowship, the impact on his dignity, the ending of his career, and being \nseparated as a major.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17(b) does not apply because failure to cooperate, omission, or \nconcealment was not caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate \nadvice. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply because the conduct was not minor.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d) applies because Applicant has acknowledged his guilt and \nacknowledged his behavior was inappropriate and taken positive steps to eliminate the \ninappropriate behavior. Since Applicant is no longer in the service, conduct unbecoming \nan officer cannot recur. Applicant will not again face punishment under the UCMJ. \nApplicant knew his conduct was inappropriate and he accepted his punishment and left \nthe service.  \n \nHaving left the service, Applicant has taken positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other \ninappropriate behavior. Applicant and the other woman are now divorced and free to \nhave a relationship. AG \u00b6 17(e) applies because the affair has been revealed, which \nreduces or eliminates vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17(f) does not apply because the information was substantiated and AG \u00b6 \n17(g) does not apply because Applicant was not associated with persons involved in \ncriminal activity.  \n\n \n11 \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 30 articulates the security concerns \nrelating to criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; \n \n(b) discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces under dishonorable \nconditions; \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted; \n \n(d) individual is currently on parole or probation; \n \n(e) violation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a court-mandated \nrehabilitation program; and \n \n(f) conviction in a Federal or State court, including a court-martial of a \ncrime, sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year and \nincarcerated as a result of that sentence for not less than a year.  \n \n \nIn November 2007, Applicant received nonjudicial punishment for violation of the \nUCMJ. Applicant entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (Ex. 5) accepting \nnonjudicial punishment and setting forth the offenses. AG \u00b6 31 (c) applies.  \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; \n \n\n \n12 \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement; and \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a) applies to Applicant\u2019s inappropriate conduct. It has only been two \nyears since the behavior ended, but it happened under such unusual circumstances that \nit is unlikely to recur. Applicant is now divorced as is the other woman. He is no longer \nin the military and no longer subject to the UCMJ. The conduct occurred in part because \nof pressures of a bad marriage and those pressures are no longer present in Applicant\u2019s \nlife. However, I do not find that Applicant was pressured or coerced into committing the \nacts. AG \u00b6 32(b) does not apply. None of the other mitigating factors apply.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant had a relationship with the \nwife of a fellow Marine. He accepted that his conduct was inappropriate and accepted \nhis punishment for his action. He has been punished for his conduct. Applicant knew his \nmilitary career was over and submitted a voluntary retirement request. He is no longer \nin the military. Neither Applicant nor the other woman are currently married. They are \nfree to resume a relationship, which violates no law. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his personal conduct \nand criminal conduct. \n\n \n13 \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Personal Conduct:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Criminial Conduct:   \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n",
